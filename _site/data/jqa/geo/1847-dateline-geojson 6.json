S. Todd, dated at Wheeling the 28th. of April last, enquiring, with some degree of formality, my opinion, with regard to the comparitive healthiness, or unhealthiness, of Air, heated by Furnaces, in the Cellar, or basement, of a house, over that heated, by common Fire places— He alleges, that he is building a large and expensive house, at Wheeling, and that his enquiries, are instigated, by the diversities of opinion, which he finds among his friends, on this subject— I took a ride and walk before dinner. Mr. Thom was here this evening, and brought us a sample of Mexican Chapparal— We finished reading of Walpole’s Memoirs, of the first ten years, of the reign of George III— They are not very interesting, as they close, precisely at the time, when the contest between Great Britain and her North American Colonies, become of transcendent importance, to the History of this Country— They relate almost entirely, to the personal intrigues, of the Earl of Chatham the Earl of Bute, the Bedford, and Grenville families, Duke of Grafton, and Marquis of Rockingham.

Council June 1833. with an appendix, containing Laws of the United States relating to the City, by Andrew Rathbun— In page 209 of this Book, I found an Act authorizing the appointment of a Surveyor of the City of Washington and establishing a Surveyors Office therein and in page 384, of the same Volume an Act authorizing the proprietors, of Squares and Lots in the City of Washington to have the same subdivided and admitted to Record— These two acts, contain the Laws, by which, the present City Surveyor, and Dr. Miller, have proceeded in the Survey, of the division line, between the Lot 16. belonging to me, and the Lot 17. which belongs partly to Dr. Miller. I called on Mr. Frye, at his Office, and referred him to these two Laws, requesting him to examine, the Plat of the City of Washington, and laid down under the Act of Congress, and recorded, the 4th. of October 1792— Mr. Frye did accordingly, examine the Plat of the City and obtain from the surveyor’s Officer, a certified Copy, of the Square Number 253. He took with him this copy and gave it to me certified by two witnesses himself, and Col Moore— I consulted with Mr. Frye, what I should further do, to secure my own property and I concluded, to have a regular Survey, and Plot, of the two Lots, Number 8. and 16, in Square 253, made by the City Surveyor and a Plot thereof, duly authenticated to ascertain, the Bounds of my own property—and so far as relates, to the encroachment, of my brick Stable, upon the lot Number 17. to abide by the Law, as specially prescribed, in the act, in page 384, of Rothwell’s, edition of the Laws of the Corporation of the City in the fourth section of which it is especially provided for— We took a ride this afternoon, and had evening visits, first from Mr. & Mrs. Robert Greenhow, and afterwards from Mrs. Madison and Miss Payne— "

In the agreement between the Commissioners and David Burns, the original Proprietor of this Square. the Lot Number, 8, was assigned, to the Public and the Lot Number 16. would remain to the said David Burns— Mr. Frye will apply to the City Surveyor, for a new Survey of the Lots number 8. and 16. I had some conversation last evening, with Mr. Greenhow, concerning, the expedition of St Dennis, to Mexico, in 1715, and he sent me today, an Article published by him, in the New Orleans Commercial Review of October 1846, and of the New York Evening Post of November 13th.: of the same year with some additional Manuscript notes, all of which are parts, of an unpublished History of Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, by him.

Streets. of the original Plan of the City of Washington made and certified by the Commissioners, on the 4th. day of October 1792— He also wrote me this day a note, stating that Colonel William Brent the Clerk of the Circuit Court, had promised him yesterday, copies of the Deeds, from David Burns, of Lots No 8 and 16 square No two-hundred and fifty three and that the Surveyor of the City had promised to re-survey the Plot, of Lots No 8 and 16, next Tuesday— I received another Note from Mr. Frye, delivered to me by Alexander Borland whom he recommends, as a Carpenter to contract, for repairing the Stable— I visited the Observatory, and saw the West Transit Instruments, the Prime Vertical Instrument, theCircle, the Meridian Circle and the Equatorial— There is another Instrument, called the Refraction Circle ordered, to be made by Ertel at Munich but which has not yet arrived. In the Appendix to the Volume of Astronomical Observations presented me by Lieut M. F. Maury, there is at page 14, a List, of fifteen Officers besides himself attached to the Office. for all its duties of observation and computationone of these is Mr. Sears. C. Walker—between whom and the Superintendent Maury, there appears to be some misunderstanding— In the National Intelligencer of yesterday there was an Article, from Mr. Maury, dated from the Observatory though not signed and an Article this morng signed by Mr. Walker concerning which I spoke to Mr. Maury, with regret as indicating some dissension between them— Mr. Walker complains that he was the person who made the discovery that Lalande the French Astronomer had actually observed in March 1795. as a fixed Star, the recently discovered Planet Neptune—and that Mr. Maury in announcing this fact, had not specially named him Walker, as the person who had first ascertained and announced this fact. Mr. Maury, disclaims any intention of injustice, to Mr. Walker, whose seems to me unreasonable; But the discovery of this New Planet Neptune has led to wonderful excitement among the Astronomers of Europe, and of America, pleasingly indicative of the intense interest, taken in the pursuit of Astronomical Science "

After a restless and sleepless night, I was deprived of my walk and the portion of time which I could devote to any occupation, was spent in reading newspapers, Articles in Littell’s Living Age, and Beloes’ Herodotus. It serves the hour but leaves no impression I have got through with Clio—Euturpe, and Thalia, and half Melpomene— But this most ancient of Profane Historians seems rather a collector of Anecdotes than merely an Historian— A very small portion of the Anecdotes appear to have any foundation in fact, and they are all discredited by the perpetual occurence of the marvellous— There is also an inextricable confusion of names and the same persons, are mentioned by different names in Herodotus, Diodorus Seculus, Justin the Abbreviator of Trogus Pompeius whose work has perished, and the scriptures of the Old Testament. Chronology prior to the age of Alexander of Macedon is an inextricable chaos— The writings of David, of Solomon, and of Homer about twelve hundred years before Christ, stand unaccountable monuments of Literature in a very high degree of improvement, with a subsequent period of at least seven hundred years, of total barbarism. The Psalms of David, the Proverbs of Solomon, and the Illyad and Oddissy of Homer are phenomena in the History of literature hitherto unexplained. and in all probability so to remain notwithstanding the recent discovery of the secret of Hierogliphical writing.

His name was Lemuel Shattock— A Mr. Bliss came afterwards alone—and I was requested to write out my Answer to the Address which had been made to me by them.

And he bequeaths, all his interest in the Funds of the said Cincinnati to his daughter Charlotte Walker to her Heirs and Assigns forever— Mr. Malone states that he had written to Philadelphia for the necessary information to enable the Executor of Andrew Walker to get the Funds if any, but was referred to me as more able to give the information than any other person. It is strange that I know not to whom excepting Joseph. B. Bird, to whom I could apply, to obtain this information— I received also a Pamphlet entitled the Daguerreotype a magazine of Foreign Literature and Science selected chiefly from the Periodical Publications of England France and Germany. 1847.

That professed atheists were not very common; but that every person who manifested their disbelief, of the existence of a Supreme Being, to whom they were responsible for their lives upon Earth, must be held to live without God in the World— The Discourse of the Afternoon, was upon a more familiar Doctrine of Religious Morals.

Mr. Charles Brooks of Boston came also while we were at dinner. Mr. Vattemare appears to have lost none of his zeal and enthusiasm for his project and system of exchanging Books. He professes however, to have abdicated his second character of Ventriloquist and stage Player— He is now, no longer Mr. Alexander but simply Mr. Vattemare— He and Mr. Filmore, returned to Boston by the Railroad Cars and both propose to leave the City tomorrow— I rode with Mrs. Charles Adams to Milton leaving Mr. George.

Last night my rest was much broken and I find myself very weak this day— Mr. Lunt preached at home in the morning from Nehemiah 6.3. “And I sent messengers unto them saying I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down why should the work cease whilst I leave it and come down to you”— The stress of this Discourse was upon the words “I am doing a great work,” which Mr. Lunt applied to his hearers, who had all he said “a great work” to do— But the Discourse Historical— The great work which Nehemiah was doing was of a character different from that which Christian hearers of the present day are called to perform,— Into the historical portion of the text he did not enter very deeply only mentioning that Nehemiah was Cup Bearer of ArtaxerxesKing of Persia by whose authority Nehemiah was authorized to accomplish the rebuilding of the Temple of Jerusalem. first commanded by Sirus. after the Babylonian captivity— This was a most interesting period of the History of the Tribe of Judah consequent to its extinction as a separate Kingdom from that of the Ten Tribes otherwise called the Samaritans. It would require a deeper insight into the History of the two Kingdoms than was taken by Mr. Lunt. And among other things it would require a development of the rivalship and mutual hatred between the Kingdoms of Judah and of Samaria, to which there is repeated allusion in the new Testament but no full explanation of it given. The Kingdom of Judah was partially restored and the Temple of Jerusalem reconstructed until finally destroyed by the Romans—the Kingdom of Samaria was never restored nor is it known what became of the remnant of the Children of Israel which had separated from the Descendants of Judah— this part of the sacred History is left in great obscurity and there have been Historical inquirers who pretend to discover traces of that people among the Tribes of North American Indians— Mr. Lunts Afternoon Sermon was from Phillippians 4.12. “I know how to abound”—which is only a part of the verse, the whole of which is, “I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound, everywhere, and in all things, I am instructed, both to be full, and to be hungry, both to abound, and to suffer need.” There was nothing particularly remarkable in this Discourse. I received a Pamphlet entitled Christianity and Slavery. A review of Drs. Fuller and Wayland on domestic Slavery—by William Hague a Baptist Minister in Boston Pastor of a Church in Bedford Street— Drs. Fuller and Wayland are also Baptist Ministers one of Beauford South Carolina the other of Providence Rhode Island where he is President of Brown University— In this controversy Dr. Fuller, sustains the cause of Slavery and Wayland betrays the cause of Christianity—as is honestly shown, by Mr. Hague— "

The other Members are David Sears, who is at Newport, Theodore Lyman, Robert— T— Paine, J. Ingersoll Bowditch, and Francis Peabody of Salem— Mr. Abbott Lawrence has very recently made a donation of fifty thousand dollars to Harvard University for the establishment of a Professorship of Practical Science, for which I this day offered him my personal hearty thanks, and told him that if I had not given them to him before in writing, they had been in my heart from the first moment I had heard of this more than princely munificence. I next proceeded to my sons Office No 23 Court Street, where I found him, with Mr. Charles Sumner— Mr. Shepherd one of the Editors of the Boston Daily Whig came in with several Newspapers and spoke of some trouble in the Whig Party at New Bedford—which however was not fully explained to me— A more important incident is stated in some of this days newspapers that is that on Monday the 30th. of August a fight occurred at Drummond Town, Accomac County, Virginia between Thomas. H. Bayly, the member of Congress from the Accomac District and Mr. Finney one of the Representatives of the County in the Legislature of the State growing out of the late Division of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in which Bayly, shot Finney in the thigh The excitement is said to be intense—Bayly was imprisoned in the Jail a part of Monday, has been compelled to leave the County, and on Friday the 3d. September took passage in the Boat for Baltimore— The excitement is said to have prevailed to such an extent that on Monday one of the magistrates of the County went on the Bench armed with a pair of Revolving Pistols and a Bowie knife. But what the cause of the excitement was, except late division of the Methodist Episcopal Church, is not told. From my Sons Office I called at Dr. Bigelows House on Summer Street;—but he was not at home— I met the Ladies here, and went to Dr Frothinghams, but Mrs. Frothingham went this day to Medford and the Dr. himself was not at home— After waiting for his return till some time past one oclock we returned to Quincy, to dinner. After which, I took a walk round the short Square and in the Eveg. my son and his Wife, with Louisa Catherine were here in Mr. Beale and his daughter Ann, also paid us an hour’s visit— "

Alger— We found the Council assembled, and the . . . of the Delegates invited to the ceremony calling over by the Rev John Pierce D.D. Pastor of the Church at Brookline acting as Scribe— The Churches invited were more numerous than usual; and there were in attendance as many as forty Pastors, each with one lay Delegate— When they were all called over Dr. Pierce observed that before proceeding to the ordination it was usual for the person to be ordained to produce some testimonials of his qualifications for the Office of the Ministry, but Mr. Alger observing that he was known to many of the gentlemen in attendance, he had not thought it necessary to obtain any testimonials to his qualifications. No objection however was made to proceeding— Dr. Pierce then observed that it was also usual, for the person about to be Ordained to give some account of his opinions and the Doctrines of his Faith, and he enquired if any person desired this of Mr. Alger. A motion was accordingly made that he should be requested to give such an account. An Amendment was proposed to the Motion to substitute the word required instead of requested. And upon taking the vote the word requested was retained— And upon the vote with the word requested the answers in the affirmative and negative were so nearly equal that the moderator declared he was unable to determine on which side the decision had been— He then proposed that those who were for requesting the candidate, to declare his opinions should show their sense by rising in their seats whereupon twenty two members rose. after which the members against making the request rose and they were nine in number. Whereupon Dr. Pierce declared the majority were in favor of making the request which he accordingly did Mr. Alger then summed up his Faith in the belief of the existence of a God, the immortality of the Soul, and the responsibility of Man to his Maker in a future World. No further inquiries were made and the vote was immediately taken to proceed to the Ordination. They began with an Anthem, followed by an introductory Prayer by the Revd. F. D. Huntington of Boston whose Ordination I attended as Delegate from the Church some three or four years since. In the order of exercises it was said that selections from Scriptures should be read by the Rev Nathl. Hall, but this part was omitted— A Hymn by the Rev Henry Ware Junior was then sung, and a Sermon was preached by the Rev Samuel. K. Lothrop Pastor of the Brattle Street Church in Boston. His text was from 2 Corinthians 2–16. “Who is sufficient for these things”—and his argument was that a minister of the Gospel to be fitted for his Office, should be sufficient for all things— The Sermon was succeeded by the Prayer of Ordination by the Rev Horatio Alger an uncle of the candidate— Then came the Charge, by the Rev Ephraim Peabody, then the right hand of Fellowship by the Rev Edward Everett Hale, then a Hymn by Charles Sprague Esqr. then an Address to the Society by Revd. George Putnam D.D. then a concluding prayer by the Revd. N. G. Thomas then a closing Hymn a Doxology from  then the Benediction by the Pastor himself, according to Custom. The solemnities had commenced at 1/2 past two oclock, it was near six when they closed. The Church was very crowded and the weather oppressively warm. I had been part of the time apprehensive of fainting, but made out to get through and immediately to return home, in the Carriage which took Mr. Lunt home. There had been several strangers here visitors from the State of Michigan and in the evening my Son and his wife were here. "

Dr. Woodward was here this morning and I gave him an indifferent account of my condition of favorable improvement of which I have little encouragement to expect. I began reading the Articles Telescope and Glass, and immediately found myself ignorant beyond all conception. Even of the difference between flint glass and crown glass, and equally so, of that between Telescopes constructed upon the principles of Catoptics and those of Dioptics For the time and opportunity to study all this the remainder of my life is not sufficient— The discoveries in practical Astronomy commencing with that of the Planet Uranus have all been dependent upon the improvement of the Instruments used for Astronomical Observations, that is enlarging by Artificial means the power of the Human eye, and if future discoveries, of the mechanism of the Universe all depend upon the extent to which the power of vision in the bodily frame of man may be enlarged. Of all the senses belonging to man it is by the sight alone that he can form conceptions of the structure of the Universe—from the other senses of Hearing, feeling, Smell, and taste, he can receive no assistance to convey intelligence to the mind and it would seem that his sight can be enlarged only by the means of instruments of glass— Until the year 1785—all the researches of the human mind in Astronomy had only discovered its own delusions respecting the Solar system and its own errors in trusting for thousands of years to the movements of the Heavenly bodies as they appear to the naked eye—all totally different to the ostensible Reports of the daily changes of day and night— I took a ride this afternoon with Miss Louisa. C. Smith and Miss Mary Cutts round Milton returning by the Neponset road— My son was here in the Evening— "

Bartol Colleague Pastor with the Rev Dr. Charles Lowell at the West line Street Congregational Church Boston preached by exchange with Mr. Lunt— His morning text was from Romans 1.20. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the World are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and God head—and Romans 2.15. [“]Which shew the work of the Law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another. 16. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my Gospel”— The practise of taking double texts seems to have become a Fashion among the younger Clergymen of the Trinitarian Denomination. I somewhat doubt its propriety; it leads to the complication of the theme of the Discourse— The subject of Mr. Bartols sermon was the foundation of Religious Belief and the correspondent human action, but from his double text he drew a three fold impulse upon the agony of man—first Nature, secondly duty, thirdly Revelation The Discourse was argumentative and the reasoning forcible. His delivery was cold, and inanimate. The Text of his Afternoon Sermon was 1. Corinthians 7.31—[“]And they that use this World, as not abusing it”— The Doctrine drawn from this Text was, that this World was made for the use of man, but a Religion and morality were given him to preserve him from abusing it— Mr. Bartol dined with us. His is a graduate of Bowdoin College of the year 1831. I was obliged to ride to and from Meeting morning and afternoon. The storm of rain continued till the night. "

Smith, and Miss Cutts, stopt of the way at Mr. Quincy house—he had been at my house yesterday afternoon, but I was lying down and did not see him. Not knowing whether the members of the Committee of the Board of Overseers of Boston had visited the Observatory yesterday or not—this was first to be ascertained— I left the Carriage in Summer Street and walked to the Counting house of Abbott and Amos Lawrence in Milk Street, but Mr Abbott Lawrence was not there neither did I see him— He was attending a meeting of the Directors of a Seamans Saving Bank where I endeavored to find him but without success. I went to my sons Office No 23. Court St. and found a number of gentlemen there in consultation with him prepatory to a meeting of a State Convention of the Whigs to be held at Springfield on the 29th. of this month. While there I received from Mr. J. Ingersoll Bowditch the Report of the Committee of the Board of Overseers of the Observatory, made yesterday and signed by Messrs David Sears, Abbott Lawrence, J Ingersoll Bowditch and Francis Peabody, who actually met—received the Reports of the Perkins Professor of Astronomy and mathematics—Pearce and of the Observer W. C. Bond and made the Report to the Board of Overseers, to be submitted at the session of the Legislature next Winter. From my Sons Office I proceeded, to the Revd. Dr. N. L. Frothinghams, where I had agreed to meet the ladies, to return to Quincy— I found Dr. Frothingham at home but he was obliged to go out at one oclock to a christening— I could have but a very short conversation with him and at half past one we left his house and returned to Quincy— My son and his daughter Louisa went this Evening to Boston to the Opera. and we were left at home. Isaac. Hull. Adams. dined with us; and Elizabeth Adams was here last Evening. I received a Letter from H. G. Sommerby, who proposes to go to England, to investigate the pedigrees of the early settlers of New England— I read the Report of the Committee who visited the Observatory yesterday and the Reports of the Perkins Professor and of the Observer William. C. Bond to them, deeply regretting my failure to attend at the meeting and that of Mr. Quincy consequent upon mine— There is yet one Astronomical Instrument to be received from England and mounted for the complete organization of the Observatory— "

I remained there about an hour.

[“]And he entered again into the Synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand”— This was the occasion upon they watched Jesus whether he would heal the man’s withered hand on the Sabbath day—their purpose being to make it a charge against him He did heal the man’s hand and the Pharisees took counsel with the Herodians how they might destroy him. He had in defence of himself laid down as the real law sanctifying, the Sabbath that the sabbath was made for man—and not man for the Sabbath that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath-day, putting it to them in the form of a question which they dared not answer— He recurred to the example of David whom he considered as justified in a double violation of the Levitical Law, not only by eating to appease his hunger but by taking the shewbread which none but the Priests were obliged to eat. Mr. Lunt did not much enlarge upon this point of view but rather dilated by a description of the great power conferred upon man by the exercise of the hand, and the great abridgment of all the powers of man when deprived of the use of hand— The afternoon text was from Matthew 13.18. “Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.” One of the many Discourses upon which the moral principles of Christianity were founded. Lieut Joseph. H. Adams who is stationed at Charlestown came and dined with us, but the foul weather confined all our Ladies at home. "

VI  An uneasy comfortless night Mr. Lunt administered the Communion and preached from Luke 13.23— “Then said one unto Him Lord are there few that be saved and He said unto them. 24. Strive to enter in at the straight gate for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able”— It is remarkable that a direct answer to the question is evaded instead of it is an implied censure upon the question itself and a strong exhortation to the hearers instead of busying themselves with inquiries as to the number of those that should be saved to confine their attention to the means of securing their own Salvation. The Discourse was elaborate and impressive— That of the afternoon was by Mr. Simmons from Matthew 11.11. [“]Verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist, notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he”—an interesting Discourse upon the character of John the Baptist. There is a German Essayist by the name of Fuster who in a Review of the Gallery of Pictures at Dresden has selected an imaginary Portrait of John the Baptist, as the subject of a dissertation upon the character of this wonderful personage, which I think Mr. Simmons must have read, and from which he must have borrowed many ideas in portraying this forerunner of the Messiah, deserving of the profound meditation of every pious Christian. Mr. Loring of Hingham was at the afternoon service and paid me afterwards a visit. Mrs. Loring being at Mr. John Greenleafs— Mr. Quincy was here in the Evening, and proposed to take some fair day to visit the Observatory at Cambridge to make up our failure to attend with the Committee of the Board of Overseers on the 21st. of September My son and his wife were also here this Evening. Fine day. I walked to and from meeting this morng— "

Miss Elizabeth Susan Quincy, and Miss Abby Quincy, were also here and I requested them to propose to their Father to go on an expedition to visit the Observatory next Thursday if the weather shall permit— I received in the Evening a note from Miss Quincy accepting this proposition of which Mr. Quincy engages to give notice to President Edward Everett. In addition to my reading of Dupuis Universelle Religion, through the slow length of which I am continuing to drag.

Breakfasted, and at eight oclock this morning, called in my Carriage at Mr. Josiah Quincys and took him with me to visit the Observatory at Cambridge, the other Members of the Committee of the Board of Overseers, namely David Sears, Abbott Lawrence J. Ingersoll Bowditch and Francis Peabody did pay the visit on the 21st. of September and made a Report thereof to be returned with Reports from the Perkins Professor of Astronomy and Mathematics Mr. Pierce and from Wm. C. Bond, the Observator to be returned to the Board of Overseers during the approaching Winter Session of the General Court. In consequence of my own personal indisposition, of that of President Quincy suffering from inflammation of the eyes, of President Everett who was that day confined to his Bed by sickness and of a threatened storm in the morning, I was deterred from calling upon Mr. Quincy to proceed to Cambridge on that day as we had agreed. We were disappointed accordingly in attending with the other Members of the Committee and substituted a visit of this day, for our own satisfaction— We reached Cambridge at ten oclock and President Everett went with us to the Observatory, where we found the Observator William. Cranch. Bond. and his son and Assistant George. C. Bond—but Professor Pierce was not there. The great Frauenhofer Refractor a small Transit Instrument and a very complete Comet seeker were all there perfectly mounted. The large Equatorial upon a very Capital stone pier. There is however one large Transit Instrument to be constructed by Simms at London which has not yet arrived and seems to have been too long delayed. one of the Glasses having disappointed the Maker himself so that he concluded to make another. The sky though clear early this morning had clouded up before we reached the Observatory, and we could take no view through the principal Instrument About twelve oclock we returned to President Everetts and then home. I left Mr. Quincy at his house and reached my own before three oclock in time for dinner— In the Afternoon I took a solitary walk, and my Son and his Wife were here in the Evening— Elizabeth Adams and Isaac Hull were also here— In our ride this morning, I had a conversation with Mr. Quincy in which, I suggested to him the expediency, of preparing a plan for organizing the Observatory with reference to its two distinct objects, first, as an Astronomical Observatory, for the assiduous cultivation of the Science of Astronomy, and Secondly, as a Branch of the Institution for Education of the youths of this Commonwealth— I thought it required a two fold organization having reference to both its objects one being the cultivation of the Science and the other the instruction of the Students at the University. Mr. Quincy concurred with me, in this view, and I intended to have conversed with the President, and him together, but we had not time sufficient for it— I spoke of it to Mr. Everett, but the difficulty immediately occurred to him of the want of Funds. He said the University had already incurred an expense of thirty two thousand dollars in addition to the donations which had been applied to this object, and that no provision had yet been made for the support of an Observator. There is yet much to be done and little encouragement before this Institution can be made to answer its complicated purposes— "

Mr. Emmons called here, with two Volumes of Rogers Poems, which he proposes to present to Mr.Meredith, and he requested me to write some lines, but without saying what by way of autograph. I wrote accordingly a very few lines expressing my opinion of Rogers, as the most pleasing English Poet of the present Century. I remember reading the Pleasures of Memory at the time of its first publication. I think as early as 1793. and they gave me more pleasure than any of the Poems of Cowper, Burns, in any of the De la cruscan writers of the same period, and much more than Southey or Peter Pindar at that time more popular than all the rest, and now almost totally forgotten. I was personally acquainted with Mr. Rogers at that time and met him several times in Society though not at his own house— Campbell was of rather a later date, Walter Scott still later. Byron and Shelley last of all. Coleridge and Wordsworth are hardly to be included in the Catalogue and of some later Poet Tasters I cannot charge my memory with their names. I ask the pardon of Mr. Moore upon the whole the one who will last the longest of them all with filmy, gauzy, glossamary lines. as Darwin was characterized by the author of the once famous Pursuits of Literature.

Mr. Morison dined with us, and the text of his afternoon Discourse was from John 4.32. “But he said unto them I have meat to eat, that ye know not of.” I walked to and from Meeting morning and Afternoon and with more power to walk than I have had for some months.

This is said by Adam to Eve in conversation, it does not absolutely appear that it expresses Miltons opinion of man in his fallen state but it contains the avowed belief of Emanuel Swedenborg and of his Sectarians. That communion with Spiritual Beings may have been one of the enjoyments of Adam in Paradise, I have right to deny though it would seem that it was not enjoyed at least with equal clearness by Eve. He asserts the fact as a thing not before known to her and yet he reminds her that they have heard these Celestial voices from the “steep of echoing hill or thicket, singing their great Creator”— However it may have been with Adam. I believe it was but a delusive dream in in Swedenborg. the existence of intelligent Spiritual Beings I cannot deny nor affirm—as a part of the Christian Religion it is a subject of belief, but not of proof and of the present state of the world— I never have heard “Celestial voices Singing to the midnight air” nor do I believe that any other human being in possession of his senses has heard them. These lines however gave occasion to much reflection in my mind this day. My Grandaughter Mary Louisa went with Mrs. Miller and Mrs. George T. Bigelow to Charlestown to visit Lieut Joseph. H. Adams in charge of the Ship Franklin— They returned this Afternoon— I took my morng walk and afternoon ride with my wife Mrs. Charles and her Mary round Milton Hill— Charles daughter Louisa dined with us— I received from Aaron.

I heard only a part of this paper which prolonged the Session of this day till it was past two oclock— Among the Members present were Ex President Josiah Quincy and Mr. Robert. C. Winthrop recently returned from a voyage to England. I gave to Mr. Quincy the Report of the Committee of the Overseers of Harvard University on the Observatory with the annexed papers and my own Letter to President Edward Everett all to be reported to the Overseers at the next Winter Session of the Legislature— Mr. Quincy engaged to deliver or transmit them all to President Edward Everett. At the adjournment of the Meeting I walked to Dr. Frothingham’s house where I found my wife already in the Carriage at the door and returned home to Quincy to dinner. The cold of the night, had subsided but not so as to give me a comfortable Evening. Isaac Hull and Lieut. Joseph. H. Adams dined with us. and the former staid with us for the night.

Mr. Capin did not appear to have any settled opinion what this gift of Tongues was. he seemed to question whether it was a miraculous power to speak different languages. although that has been generally held to be the power precisely conferred. I cannot conceive indeed how the account in the Book of the Acts can be otherwise understood it says “When the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every nation under Heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in their own language, and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another, behold are not all these which speak Gallalaeans and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites and the dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia Frigia and Pamphilia, in Egypt and in the parts of Lybia about Cyrene and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes. Cretes and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. And they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this.” Nothing can be more explicit though to be sure others mocking said these men are full of new wine. Mr. Capin through some doubt over the whole transaction and made somewhat light of it considering the mere gift of speaking sundry languages as of not much importance and less connected with the other gift of prophecy— This afternoon Discourse was fromMr. Capin dined with us. and Mr. Degrand came out from Boston and dined with us also.

Levin the native American Member from Philadelphia. at Coleman’s Hotel and left a Card for Stephen. A. Douglass Senator from the State of Illinois. I also met Lieut Maury and agreed to Call at the Observatory this Evening to view the moon through the Equatorial if the Sky should prove bright. At six oclock P.M. I went accordingly it being the ninth day of the Moon and the Sky sufficiently clear to look at the Moon, but thickning with haze till nothing distinct was to be seen and I came home before eight oclock. Lieut Maury promised to call on me the first clear Evening. But Astronomical Observation is always liable to disappointment from transient clouds— Lieut Maury told me that of seventeen Officers attached to the Observatory in 1846 scarcely one was now left but another set had taken their places. The appearance of the Moon as viewed through eye pieces of different magnifying power differs totally from its aspect to the naked eye. The appearance of the Disk resembles on its surface much to that of a plum Cake crusted with sugar. with great and extraordinary irregularities on the surface and several seeming holes going into impenetrable darkness. There is nothing resembling water and nothing having an appearance of vegetation, the general impression that it gives is of lifeless barrenness—the question whether it has any atmosphere remains unsettled. Mrs. Maury and several ladies and gentlemen came in as I came away. Mr. Maury spoke of Prof Pierce’s questions whether the Planet Neptune is really the Planet discovered by the previous calculations of Leverrier Its Orbit is not yet ascertained though inferred by approximation from the fact ascertained by Mr. Sears. J. Walker that the star was observed by the French Astronomer Lalande on the 8th. of May 1795. Three additional Planets named Astria, Hebe, and Iris have been discovered within the last two years— They are parts of that supposed exploded Planet between Mars and Jupiter of which four had been previously discovered and called Asteroids. Mr. Maury supposes that there are perhaps many more fragments of this Planet to be discovered hereafter. "

It is however very apparent that this election of all the Officers of the House will be carried by the screws of the Whig Party. I suppose they will be applied for Matthew St. Clair Clarke and there is little chance therefore for Mr. Sargent. He walked with me to the door of my house, but declined to come in. I took a ride with my wife and Grand Daughter this Evening. We had no visitors— I received a Letter from G. W. Hill of Ashland Ohio full of political speculations to which he requests my answer. I began but did not finish a Letter to Elisha Whittlesey General agent of the Board of Managers of the National Monument Society. "

I received a Tragedy of five Acts called Arnold or the Treason of West point by Horatio Hubbel printed at Philadelphia, in the present year 1847. The copy of it sent to me is addressed to me in manuscript, but without the signature of the author or indicating from whom it comes— It is Dedicated to the American People as a fragment of their History— As a Drama it is constructed according to the rules of art composed in blank verse, but without anything in it, in my opinion worthy to be remembered. I do not know that it would be possible to compose a Tragedy upon that subject which could remain as a work for a duration of Ages. It is perhaps the most extraordinary incident of the American Revolution and as a part of its History possesses deep interest—the History of it as a narrative has been written and published in French by B. De Marbois who was a man of Letters, and Secretary of the Minister of France, the Chevalier De La Luzerne in company with whom I came in the Summer of 1779. from L’Orient to Boston in the French Frigate La Sensible This work of Marbois is exceedingly well written, in a style studied to resemble that of Salust in his History with the War with Jugurtha. The subject has been very indifferently treated by all the English and American Historians of the Revolution and not remarkably well by the Italian Botan I believe this subject susceptible of a great Historical work, but doubt whether it will ever find a writer equal to it— "

No reply was made, but it was manifest that this was the purpose of the establishment of the Daily National Whig— When I first came to the City, a man came to me proposing to me to subscribe for this Paper. I asked him who was to be its Editor, which he declined to answer, and I accordingly declined to subscribe for it.

                "text": "18. VI.  In the House the Report of the Select Committee for the revisal of the Rules was the Special Order for debate and the usual effect of the appointment of such Committees was again exemplified that is to say it only made the subject of the rules more complicated than it was The first discussion was about what is called the hour Rule, that is the limitation of an hour for the time allowed to every member to speak upon any subject in Debate. The select Committee first proposed an extent of the limitation from an hour to an hour and a half, and secondly they proposed a substitute for the hour Rule allowing each member who proposes any measure another hour to close the Debate which of course establishes an inequality between the members some to be indulged with two hours and others to be confined to one. This introduced a long Debate, which was closed by a re adoption of the hour rule with the proviso that in closing debates every member shall be allowed five minutes to explain in Committee of the whole any Amendment he may offer—and by adopting a further Rule that members may address the House from the Clerks Desk or from a place near the Speakers Chair instead of from his own Seat. An additional Rule was adopted that except during the last ten days of the Session the Speaker shall not entertain a motion to suspend the Rules of the House except on Monday of every week, and except a motion for going into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Another Rule proposed was that when the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, or a Committee of the whole House finds itself without a Quorum, the Chairman shall cause the Role of the House to be called, and thereupon the Committee shall rise and the Chairman shall Report the names of the absentees which shall be entered in the Journal— Other Rules were proposed and among the rest one that in addition to the other standing Committees of the House there shall be one called the Smithsonian Committee whose duty it shall be to superintend the affairs of the Smithsonian Institution. This again introduced a long Debate all which was closed by a Resolution offered by Charles. J. Ingersoll that the Rules of the House at the last Congress with the modifications of them, this day adopted be henceforth the Rules and regulations of this House during this Session of Congress. And so ends the undertaking to simplyfy and improve the Rules for this time— The House adjourned about three oclock. "
