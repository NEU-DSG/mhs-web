                "text": "2. III.45. Tuesday  As I was going out this morning, Mr Lewis Johnson came in with a Letter from Quincy Thaxter to him stating that receipts from him and the other heirs of Nathaniel Otis for their portion of the succession of William Otis, had been sent to me, with authority to recieve the money and deliver the receipts— But I had not received them, and told Mr Johnson that I would give him immediate notice if I should. At ten I met the Committee on the revisal of the rules— Present Adams, Beardsley, C. J. Ingersoll, White, Chapman and Vinton— Absent—Wise Davis and Dromgoole, the last of whom has not once attended the Committee. Before the Quorum was formed this morning, Beardsley told me that he thought the house would not confirm the vote of the Committee to strike out the gag rule, and he intimated that Davis of Indiana had changed his opinion and would move to reverse the decision of the Committee— But Davis did not attend— The members present, after a final cursory revisal of the whole report, instructed me to present it, this day to the house—and to move that it be printed and made the order of the day for this day week.— I told Beardsley that the action of the house upon the gag would depend entirely upon the perseverance of the 27. members of the New-York delegation; and that I was told the Richmond Enquirer had threatened that if they did persevere, Van Buren’s claim to the Presidency would be forfeited— He admitted the fact and said that he hoped the members would not be moved by any such consideration— Two or three weak minded men might be. In the house the instant after the reading of the journal Charles J. Ingersoll moved a suspension of the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the bill to refund Jackson’s fine— I asked permission of the house to present the report on the revisal of the rules—that it might be printed and made the order of the day for next Tuesday— Charles J. coolly said “you can make your report[”]—but Reding of New-Hampshire objected; and the house by a vote of more than two thirds went into Committee and took up the Jackson fine bill— Barnard at the close of his fragment of an hour, was cut off in the midst of an unanswerable argument against the bill, and now followed the foulest and filthiest shower of slander upon the long since deceased judge Hall that has been witnessed since the festival of the Harpies in the Æneid—till Weller moved the Committee to rise—but the house did not immediately adjourn.

                "text": "3. V.15 Wednesday  When Weller moved yesterday, the Committee on the Jackson fine to rise it was for the purpose of having a full fresh morning hour to disgorge his bilious venom against the Whigs and his sycophancy to Jackson, on the house— When the committee rose I again presented the report of the Committee on the revisal of the rules and moved that it should be printed, and made the order of the day for next Tuesday— There was a disorderly, tumultuary opposition to receiving the report; but the Speaker did receive it, and stated the question of printing and assignment— Campbell of South Carolina called for a division of the question— There were Slave answers of no; but the Speaker without heeding them pronounced the printing, and took the question of assignment, merely by rising—he declared 63 for and 65 against the assignment and pronounced it rejected— I and many others, believed he had miscounted and that the real majority was for the assignment.— I was about to call for a count by tellers, but Elmer, chairman of the Committee of Elections, had contested the floor with me, for a motion that the Committee should be allowed to employ a clerk— The instant the Speaker announced the decision against the assignment, Elmer got the floor, and made his motion— Houston, a member of the Committee, opposed it; and Charles H. Carroll started up, and commenced a storm against the Committee, for neglect of duty in not reporting upon the contested seats of the general ticket members.— He was called to order repeatedly for irrelevancy, and decided by Beardsley, in the Chair as Speaker, to be out of order, but persevered, till the clamour for order was growing to a brawl— Jones the Speaker crept in, and Beardsley out of the chair— Carroll was still vociferating, in spite of the decision that he was out of order— Elmer, to silence the charge against the Committee of elections, of neglect of duty, withdrew his motion for a clerk, and a Slaver moved to adjourn— Carroll insisted that Elmer could not withdraw his motion, nor the other member move to adjourn, while he was on the floor, speaking; the Speaker decided that the motion to adjourn was in order— From this decision Schenk appealed; but the Speaker put the question, and the house adjourned.— I walked home and spent the evening at my writing table; answering a strange Letter from J. J. Flournoy, of Wellington near Athens Georgia.— He asks if I will present to H.RU.S. a petition for him— I answer yes—  This morning Mr Jones of the Globe Office came for instructions as to the mode of printing the report of the Committee for the revisal of the revisal of the rules, which I gave him. I had hoped to have some leisure for writing; but a flood of Newspapers came, and noon was upon me, before I had a quarter of an hour to look into the debates of the Virginia Convention upon the Constitution of the United States.— At the house after the reading of the Journal, instead of Charles J. Ingersoll’s spring gun to go into Committee of the whole on the Jackson fine bill Payne of Alabama made some fuss about the expense of warming the hall, by a furnace below which came to nothing when Cave Johnson moved to suspend the rules, for the purpose of calling the States for Resolutions— Cave Johnson and Charles J. are now the leaders of the house— Wise not having yet returned from his Christmas holidays at home, and Dromgoole just now returned from his drunken holidays here. Ingersoll and Cave are indefatigable— The rules were suspended by a vote of more than two thirds— The Jackson fine-bill was turned adrift till further order and the call for Resolutions not to be debated now, commenced— A question was immediately started whether under a call for Resolutions, members could introduce bills of which they had given previous notice— The Speaker decided first that they could not, and then that they could. And a goodly number of abortions were thus ushered into being— The Speaker began with Maine— When he came to Massachusetts I offered first a call upon the Secretary of the Treasury for the present condition of the Smithsonian fund, and the origin of its investment in State Stocks. Adopted without lying over a day, and without opposition— I then asked leave to offer another Resolution, which was tacitly granted. It was a call on the President for copies of all the Instructions, to the Commanders of the Squadron stipulated, by the Ashburton Treaty to be kept on the coast of Africa—and copies of the British Instructions to the Commanders of their squadron, if they have been communicated to our Government— This too was adopted without opposition—of New-York offered a Resolution to reconsider the vote of yesterday declared by the Speaker to have rejected my motion to assign next Tuesday for the consideration of the report of the committee on the revisal of the rules. There was much chicanery to exclude the reception of this resolution. All this failing Boyd moved to lay it on the table— The house refused by yeas and nays 80 to 87— The question then was direct on the reconsideration; but the Speaker was averse to putting it— Davis of Indiana, whose vote in the Committee had decided the rescinding of the gag-rule, now voted to lay on the table the motion to assign next Tuesday for the consideration of the report, and Beardsley urged to postpone the question of reconsideration, till the close of the call for resolutions, with an understanding that it should then be immediately taken— It was clear that if I insisted on taking the question on reconsideration now, it would fail, and I consented to the postponement. The call for Resolutions continued. Rhett offered one to instruct the Committee of Ways and Means to report a horizontal duty bill, and moved the previous question— The whigs indulged him with a second, and then rejected his Resolution by yeas and nays 57 to 112— John Campbell offered a Resolution to appoint M’Cormick Post-master to the house; but the Northern Slavers had pounced upon their prey, and forced down the throats of their Southern accomplices an order that the house would elect a Postmaster to morrow— So the Speaker declared Campbell’s motion out of order. He then modified it into a resolution, to rescind the order for electing the Postmaster to-morrow—but it availed him nothing— Weller moved to lay his resolution on the table, and called for the yeas and nays— Carried 94 to 76— Thus it is; that the Northern phalanx of the Slavo-democracy, dragoon the South in the distribution of the spoils, in return for their sale of the freedom of their constituents in the Slave-market as the Dutch traders to Japan, purchased the privilege of dealing for spices by trampling on the cross— Black of Georgia, brought up Rhett’s anti-tariff resolution in another form—an instruction to the Committee of Ways and Means to report a tariff bill for raising revenue only—and this was rejected by yeas and nays by a majority of only one—83 to 84. A. V. Brown introduced a Bill to repeal the districting Section of the apportionment Law— Campbell moved its reference to the Committee of elections— Brown moved its reference to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union which was carried. Duncan moved an instruction to the Committee of Ways and Means to report in substance the repealed sub-treasury bill: to divorce the Government from all connection with Banks—carried by yeas and nays 110 to 58— M’Dowell of Ohio, ran the anti-tariff racer a third heat by a Resolution to instruct the Committee of Ways and Means to report a bill modifying the tariff to a collection of duties for the object of revenue, and no other.— The house adjourned— "

                "text": "4. V. Thursday—  I have named in the margin all the members including myself of the select Committee on the Massachusetts Resolves, all of whom met this morning in the room of the Committee of Commerce, and when that Committee met, passed into the room of the Committee on the Militia— I moved that the Committee should take minutes of their proceedings, and that when any member should present any resolution or motion in writing the question upon it should be taken if he desired it.— Which was agreed to and Joseph R Ingersoll consented to keep the minutes at my request. I then moved the two Resolutions, which I asked the Committee to instruct their chairman to offer to the house instructing the Committee to enquire and ascertain as far as may be practicable the number of owners of Slaves, and the amount of the chattel property represented in the house Gilmer insisted upon taking immediately the question upon the motion submitted by him at the last meeting in writing that the amendment to the Constitution proposed by the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts ought not to be recommended— I first moved as an amendment to that resolution to strike out the word not and then moved to postpone the consideration of it to discuss my Resolutions looking for calls for information and to give time for argumentative reports on both sides to be prepared and submitted to the Committee and then to the house if so decided by the committee— The question on postponement was carried by vote 7 to 2—Gilmer and Burt only voting no— Gilmer then invited me to state candidly my views in support of the amendment proposed by the Massachusetts Legislature, which I did in a very summary manner—disclaiming all intention of saying any thing offensive to any member of the committee compelled as I was to state the feelings of my constituents under their sense of the wrongs endured by them resulting from the Slave representation in Congress— Burke and Gilmer said my father had contended that the Slaves should be represented equally with the whites— But that was in the confederation of States without any representation of the people— Garrett Davis suggested that if information of the number of owners of Slaves, and of the amount of their value was to be sought—similar information of the number of other proprietors and of the value of other property would be equally necessary. From this I dissented no other property being represented in Congress— The Committee adjourned to next Tuesday at 10. O’Clock.  In the house a bad example was introduced of dispensing with the reading of a large portion of the journal— The call of the States for Resolutions was immediately resumed— Tibbatts of Kentucky, an oddity moved a reconsideration of the yesterday’s vote rejecting Blacks anti-tariff resolution for which he offered a substitute expressed in such generality as to mean nothing—whether this was to ridicule Black or for a cunning affectation of simplicity, it did not suit the anti-tariff Slavers, and Saunders moved to lay the motion of reconsideration on the table, which was carried without division— Then came up M’Dowell’s resolution upon which the previous question had been called yesterday when the house adjourned— The previous question was now carried 81 to 31. and the resolution rejected by yeas and nays 84 to 102— Vinton then offered a Resolution for the establishment of a new Committee of Commerce among the States.— This is included in the report of the Committee on the Rules—but Vinton believes the Report will be rejected by the house as I suppose it will— A multitude of other resolution was offered carving out business for the house, to consume time far beyond the first Monday of next December— Dawson of Louisiana offered a Resolution that on Saturday next at 3. p.m. debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon Bill N. 1. (the Jackson fine bill) should cease and the bill be reported to the house with such amendments as may be agreed to by the Committee—and moved the previous question carried 85 to 55—then the main question by yeas and nays 118 to 66. not two thirds and the resolution was lost— Charles J. Ingersoll was utterly disconcerted at the declaration of the Speaker that this was a resolution requiring a vote of two thirds to be carried, and looked oppugnation but finally concluded to take his seat. Hunt of Michigan offered a Resolution that the House now proceed to execute the order of the House directing the election this day of a Postmaster of the house— As this was a departure from the call for Resolutions proceeding under a suspension of the rules I supposed it would require a vote of two thirds to be carried. The Speaker decided that a majority would suffice— I appealed, and the decision of the Speaker was sustained 114 to 58. The house proceeded to the election. 5. candidates were nominated—at the first vote M Cormick the incumbent had 84 out of 189 votes—the rest scattered—at the third vote J. M Johnson had a majority of all the votes and was chosen— M’Cormick was turned out and the house adjourned— "

                "text": "5. V. Friday—  These are the members of the select Committee on the copy right bill introduced by Charles J. Ingersoll and the Memorial of the Booksellers for an international copy right law presented by me. A bare Quorum of the Committee dotted in the margin met this morning in the chamber of the Committee of foreign Affairs and conversed upon the subject of copy right internal and external. The conversation was general, and I offered some suggestions as to the natural right of literary property, to the principles of which as entertained by me, Ingersoll immediately declared his dissent— His principles are radically depraved, and never can harmonize with mine— Winthrop the chairman was very desirous that I should assume the duties of that office and prepare a report, and Leonard of New-York city expressed the same desire— But I declined for want of time, and because to take from Winthrop even at his own request his office of chairman would savour of presumption— The Committee adjourned to this day fortnight the 19th. In the house, the call for Resolutions was resumed— The territories only remained to be called— Levy the delegate from Florida, abused the indulgence of the house in relaxing the rule which allows a member to offer only one Resolution or one series of Resolutions on the same subject at a time—offered six Resolutions which were at once adopted—six which were lain over one day, and ten bills, which were referred to several committees. I required that the bills should be read by their titles and then enquired of the clerk how many of them there were Levy answered 8 or 10. I enquire again how many? he answered ten— I said we should certainly adjourn in May The instant the call for Resolutions was closed. C. J. Ingersoll moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee on the Jackson fine bill— I appealed to the good faith of the house on the pledge under which I had consented to postpone the question of reconsideration the case of the Report on the rules, that the question should be taken immediately after the call for resolutions— The Speaker said that there certainly had been such an understanding, but the Gentleman from Pennsylvania had the right to move the suspension of the rules, and if two thirds of the house should sustain him it must be so— I protested against this decision, and appealed from it.— Ingersoll exploded with a volley of insolent billingsgate upon me, and finished by withdrawing his motion to suspend the rules— The question of reconsideration was taken by yeas and nays and nays, and carried 102 to 78. Ingersoll then after some other squirming had moved to lay the motion for reconsideration on the table— I objected to his motion, as not in order; the last action of the house on the subject, having been a vote rejecting that same motion to lay the motion for reconsideration on the table. After enquiring as to the fact, and ascertaining it The Speaker decided that Ingersoll’s motion was not in order— The question then was upon my original motion reported from the Committee to assign next Tuesday as a special order for considering the report— I enquired if it would be in order for me to withdraw that motion, and move to consider the report now. The speaker said it would not. Cave Johnson enquired if the motion would be in order to make the report the special order for Tuesday The Speaker said that in the opinion of the chair it would— I demanded the yeas and nays, despairing of the success of my motion— Dromgoole moved to recommit the report, intimating that after his return from the Christmas holidays he wanted to have something to do with it— I called him to order—he persisted in his motion, and the Speaker who five minutes before had decided that it would not be in order for me to move to take up the report for consideration now, decided that Dromgoole’s motion to recommit the report was in order and debateable.— I said that was precisely what I desired—but five minutes before, the Speaker had decided that it would not be in order for me to move to take up the report now—a true sample of the Speakers impartiality— Black of Georgia, now exploded—declared he would vote for the amendment motion to recommit, and moved an amendment to it—that the Committee should be instructed to re-instate in the report the 25th or gag-rule, and then he launched out onto a furious invective and defiance of the committee for emasculating the rules of the house— The debate was now fairly under way. Davis of Indiana; asked to say a word to set himself right; as he feared he had been the innocent cause of some of the difficulties of the house in this case.— He had always voted in concession to the South against rescinding this rule, but he had always disapproved it and believed it impolitic and unwise— If therefore the report should be recommitted he should ask to be excused from serving any further on that Committee. Gilmer made a last abortive attempt to stave off the report by a point of order when a long debate ensued in which Houston, Haralson, Black, Beardsley and Clingman took part, till Dr Duncan took the floor, and house adjourned— The desperate conflict for the gag has just now commenced.

                "text": "6. V. Saturday  I had received an invitation from the Secretary of the Treasury to attend a meeting this morning at his office, at 11. O’Clock upon business connected with the National Institute— I attended at the Treasury Department accordingly but the Secretary was not there— In one of the Apartments of the building there were three or four members of the Institute, with the New Hampshire Senator Levi Woodbury acting as Chairman and Mr Markoe as Secretary— He said the invitations to the meeting had been sent under the expectation, that neither house of Congress would have sitten this day— Its object was to complete some arrangements for holding the annual meeting of the Institute next April— But as the house would sit, Mr Spencer and Mr Ingersoll had agreed that the board of Managers of the Institute were sufficiently authorised to make the arrangements for the annual meeting in April, and that the Meeting of this day might be adjourned and accordingly Mr Woodbury did adjourn it without day.— I had received a Letter dated at New-York 13. October last from Charles D. Lewis, for whom and his then partner Pierce, at Brooklyn, three or four years ago I had rendered sundry services at the Pension Office, and now informed me that while he was investigating some accounts at the Treasury department last Summer, he had seen on the book of unclaimed dividends the name of John Adams with a sum of 82 dollars standing against it to his credit; and he had sent me a blank power of Attorney by filling up of which I could draw the money— I took the opportunity this morning of making the enquiry and found that on the books was standing to the credit of John Adams for dividends of interest on the 3d. quarter of the year 1826  and as joint executor of my father’s will I received and receipted for a check on the cashier of the Bank of the Metropolis for that sum— I had not time to receive the money at the Bank, but hurried to the house where I expected Charles J. Ingersoll would start again his motion to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the Jackson fine bill; but this time the Speaker saved saved him the trouble of making the motion to choke off the debate on the rules, by deciding that henceforth that debate would only be in order during the morning hour. A decision like most of those of John W. Jones deeply tainted with Slavery— Upon this decision Dr Duncan of Cincinnati took the floor and occupied three fourths of the hour with a plausible but so far as relates to the real point at issue an ambiguous speech— He came out sufficiently clear and explicit against the rule— Assuming the same ground as Hamlin of Maine, John W. Davis of Indiana, and Clingman of North Carolina did yesterday of the Constitutional and unalienable right of petition— But from this he quickly flew off into a bitter invective upon the abolitionists and upon the negro race. Affirming without qualification the inferiority of that race to that of the whites— Insisting that of all countries on the face of the earth Africa was the only one where Christianity after being once introduced has never been able to take root— And alluding in a tone of ridicule and buffoonery to the physical conformation of the negro maintaining that no length of time or change of climate can change their complexion, their woolly head, their flat nose or their crooked leg or splay-foot; and their effluvia. The Slavers were highly delighted with this vulgar slang, and chuckled much when the Doctor pointing directly to me asked what my opinion on this subject was and intimated that I owed it to my own character, and to the country to answer his question— I took no notice of it, and after he concluded his speech he came round to my seat and asked me in a mild and friendly manner if I intended to answer his question— I said yes—but not on this debate, for I considered all that part of his speech as irrelevant to the question before the house, and if I attempted to answer it, I should in three minutes of time be called to order for irrelevancy, and the Speaker would pronounce me out of order for irrelevancy— But that on some proper occasion, I would if the house would let me, answer him to his heart’s content.— He asked in a still more pointed manner a question of Giddings with the intention of injuring him and Henry Clay— Giddings did answer him, sportively, but to his utter confusion— As soon as he finished A. V. Brown of Tennessee took the floor, but the morning hour expired in ten minutes and the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the Jackson fine bill, which was debated till near 5. O’Clock when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Douglas of Illinois made an eloquent sophistical speech prodigiously admired by the Slave Democracy of the House— This evening with my wife, Mrs John Adams and her daughter I attended a Concert.

                "text": "7. V:30 Sunday.  The concert last Evening was for the benefit of the poor, at the Assembly rooms—the old Theatre, in the Louisiana avenue— It was almost entirely Italian music of the recent Operas, closing with the Liberty song of the Puritani, wretchedly performed— An English song of a maniac lover was sung and performed on the piano by an amateur named Drayton, a silly but celebrated novelty to me. Esther Corsini sang two bravuras, with sundry screams and contortions of the face, nearly convulsive— This morning I attended with Isaac H. Adams, public worship, in the Hall of the House of Representatives, where both the chaplains were present, and Mr Tustin preached from 2. Timothy 3.16 [“]All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” He gave out Watts’s hundredth psalm, and read it by two lines at a time, setting the tune of old hundred after requesting volunteer assistance from the auditory to carry him through— The Sermon was a glorification of the Scriptures, well sustained with the exception that it conceded too much to the infidel scoffer by admitting that there was much to be said on his side of the argument, and laying the main stress of his plea for christianity on the consideration that it is safest to believe— He gave a historical summary of the time at which this epistle to Timothy, and the circumstances under which it was written, and an outline of the general purport of the Letter with some notices of Timothy, the person to whom it was written, and of the intimate and affectionate relations between Paul and him.— After the service was over Mr Tustin came with his colleague Mr Tinsley and introduced him to me, at my seat— And he asked me if I recollected the baptism of a child at Leesburg when I was there with General La Fayette and ex-President Monroe, in August 1825. I said I remembered it well: and that the impression of it was the more vivid on my mind from the fact which I had heard that the child then baptised under circumstances apparently so auspicious, died that same night— He said it was true— On my way home I called and left a card at Mr Slidells house he being not at home— Returning thence I met again Mr Tinsley who read to me a notice which he had just received that Mr Robert Baird would preach at the Presbyterian church at 7 this Evening. I went with Isaac Hull and heard him. Dr Laurie made the prayer— Mr Knox was in the pulpit Mr Bairds text was from Hebrews 13 24. They of Italy salute you and his discourse to Levy a contribution for the Waldenses. "

Monday  Immediately after the reading of the Journal in the house this morning Thomson of Mississippi moved a suspension of the rules for a motion to cease all debate in Committee of the whole upon the Jackson fine bill, at 4 O’Clock this afternoon, and to take the question on the amendments and report the bill to the house— This is the formula for suppressing all debate, and was carried by yeas and nays 116. to 54. a more than two thirds vote— Thomson then moved his resolution to smother debate, and take the Bill out of Committee at 4 p.m. this afternoon— Pratt of New-York moved as a substitute for Thomsons motion a resolution to stop debate and take the bill out of Committee in two hours, with a long preamble stating that the Legislatures of 17 States representing a population of 15 out of the 17 millions of the People of the United States had demanded the restoration of this fine; and then enumerating one by one the 17 States and the population of each of them and concluding that therefore the debate on this bill should cease in two hours and the question upon it be taken this day— Thompson accepted this as a modification of his own resolution, excepting that he adhered to his own limitation of the time to 4. O’Clock, to which Pratt acceded; and the resolution was carried— Thompson then moved to go into Committee of the whole, and it was done; John W. Davis of Indiana in the chair— Schenk of Ohio had the floor from Saturday, and made an hour speech of unrivaled eloquence in that department of debate which one of the Athenian Orators called the Shears—cutting up the arguments of the adversary— Schenk said little about the first principles involved in this case and not much about the facts, but he did cut up the malignant sycophantic declamation of Kennedy, Weller, Dean and Douglas so that there was scarcely a shred of them left. His manner is cool firm, unhesitating, with conscious mastery of his subject, his voice clear and strong, his elocution neat and elegant, with a swelling vein of sarcastic humour which more than once made the hall ring with shouts of laughter— He had got hold of Douglas, and was shaking him as a bull dog shakes between his teeth a dead rat, when his hour expired and A. V. Brown took the floor, and from that time with the exception of a short quarter of an hour for Severance, the Jackson trumpeters blew till they brayed like Jackasses till 4. They passed the bill and closed the day with a triumphal drunken bout at the Apollo Hall, toasting and crepitating with a cannon in the Street till long after midnight. "

Tuesday  The Select Committee on the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts had adjourned to meet this morning at ten in the room of the Committee of Commerce— They gathered one by one, till about half past ten when they formed a quorum; and waited another half hour for Joseph R. Ingersoll who keeps the minutes, and whom I found in Session with the Committee of Ways and Means. The members of our Committee were all present but we found on the mantle piece a scrap of paper which the door keeper of the room desired me to look at— There was written on it Resolved that this room is wanted for the Committee of Commerce, every day except those days when it is occupied by the Naval Committee— This was a mere effusion of petty spite from Holmes, now chairman of the Committee of Commerce; and the manner of notifying us was as ingenious as the Resolution itself was courteous. But it put upon me the responsibility of finding a room for our committee to meet in.— Our meeting this morning was short— Gilmer pressed hard for the question on his resolution that the amendment proposed by the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts ought not to be recommended— I consented to take the question upon my proposed amendment to strike out the word not, and the vote upon it was 6 to 3. against striking out— Giddings Morse and myself only voting for it— I then moved to postpone the question on Gilmer’s Resolution to take up my two Resolutions that the chairman be authorised to move the house for instructions to the Committee to ascertain as far as may be practicable the number of the owners of Slaves and the value of the property in Slaves— The postponement was carried— Gilmer opposed my first resolution on the ground that the Committee, had already by their Commission from the house authority to obtain the information, desired by my Resolution—whereupon I modified my resolution into a motion that the Committee authorise the chairman to obtain this information, which suited Gilmer palate no better than the other proposition— But noon arrived and the Committee adjourned to Thursday morning ten O’Clock— In the house George W Summers took his seat— The first half hour was eliminated as usual, by disorderly motions for preference in business among which was one of D. D. Barnard which I could not prevail on myself to oppose, but which after all he could not carry; and then the whole hour was consumed in chicanery to stave off the discussion of the report on the rules— Dilatory motion after motion wasted time till a motion was made to lay the whole subject on the table—rejected by yeas and naystoBut the hour was gone. The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union R. C.

                "text": "10— V:30. Wednesday.—  In the National Intelligencer of this morning there was a notice that judge William Cranch my first cousin, the intimate friend of my childhood and youth, now for more than forty years a judge and chief Justice of the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, one of the best of the race of man was by severe illness unable to attend his court, now in Session— At the door of the Patriotic Bank I met his Son William and enquired how he was. He answered in deep dejection that he was very low with a pleurisy fever of which they feared the issue— I asked if I should call at his house, I could see him He answered with some hesitation that he believed I could— I went immediately to his house where I found his Son John and William C. Greenleaf— William Cranch came in while I was there— They thought it best I should not see him, as he was in a wandering state of mind, had been much agitated by a visit from Mr Bulfinch, and his two physicians, Doctors Sewell and May—had recently left him, and directed that he should be kept as quiet as possible— I concluded to call again to morrow, and went over immediately to the Capitol, and having at the Patriotic Bank, entered as Executor of T. B. Johnson, a check from R W Dyer forand as Administrator of my Son John an order on the Hotel company Stock at Frederick Maryland forand received at the Washington Bank 60 dollars for a quarter’s interest due the first of this Month. In the house the Rules were suspended by a vote of more than two thirds to receive undebatable resolutions and calls on the President, and heads of Departments for information— Upwards of two hours were consumed in this process, which I patiently endured knowing that I could now have but one hour a day for the report on the rules, at any rate— As soon as these crudities were digested I called for the business of the morning hour and the jugglery commenced to choke off the consideration of the report— The motion pending was to postpone the consideration of the report for two weeks, which the Speaker had decided could be decided by a bare majority of votes. Winthrop now moved an amendment; that it should be made the special order of that and every succeeding day till the report should be gone through— The Speaker decided that this amendment would require a vote of two thirds— But Clinton withdrew his motion to postpone: A. V. Brown, occupied the remainder of the hour in a speech for the recommitment and instructions— The house then went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the references of the Presidents message and adjourned about 4— Fall of Snow.

                "text": "11. IV:30. Thursday.  Going to the Capitol this morning I called at judge Cranch’s house to enquire how he was, and if I could see him; and was told that he was no better than yesterday and was asleep— I met the Committee on the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, of which, yesterday I had by negotiation with the Speaker and the door keeper procured the use for the Committee— All the members of the Committee were present: but Mr Morse was at least an hour tardy— My modified motion that the chairman be instructed to enquire and ascertain as far as may be practicable the number of owners of Slaves in the several States and territories of this Union and in the district of Columbia, was earnestly debated. Gilmer struggling to strangle it by a motion of amendment proposing to request the chairman, and each member of the committee be requested by theday ofto ascertain and report any information which may be thought pertinent to the subject of enquiry— I agreed to accept this inserting before the general my special subject of enquiry the number of Slave owners and Sample moved to insert those words as an amendment to Gilmer’s amendment, which was carried 5 to 4. Davis voting upon this question, with Sample Giddings Morse and me— Gilmer, Burke, Burt and Ingersoll voting against us— The blank was filled with the first of February, Gilmer alone voting against it, and then the resolution as amended was carried by the same vote as my special object of enquiry, the number of Slave owners. My second resolution was then debated— Ingersoll moved to strike out some of the descriptive words, which was carried by his own vote, and then my resolution as amended was carried, Gilmer Burke and Burt only voting in the negative— Gilmer then moved that the journal of the Committee be reported to the house—he meant immediately to produce an explosion. I moved an amendment “with the final reports of the Committee”— My amendment was carried 7 to 2. Gilmer and Burt only voting against it and then the resolution as amended was adopted by an unanimous vote— The Committee then adjourned to the 1st of February at 10 O’Clock. In the house the rules were suspended to receive reports of Committees which would occasion no debate; and under this order Campbell, Chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, reported a petition from Lockport New-York, for a revision of the Laws of the District of Columbia with the unanimous opinion of that Committee that it came within the gag-rule, and should be returned, to the member who presented it, and he moved the previous question— I thought it was one of the petitions presented by me, and protested against the report of the Committee Committee— The petition had been presented by Mr Giddings but was in substance the same with several others presented by me— Campbell to suppress all debate, in presenting the report had moved the previous question— Hunt of New York moved to lay the report and petition on the table; and that the petition be printed— This motion was rejected by yeas and nays, 51 to 118. a vote which shows of what stuff forty of the members who have voted to rescind the rule are made— I attempted to shew the direct falsehood of the report— The Speaker stop’d me, by saying that the previous question had been called and was not debatable. I then moved that the report be laid on the table The Speaker said that motion was not in order, having just been rejected by the house I said the motion was not the same, that having been to lay the report and petition on the table and to print the petition— Mine being to lay the report on the table— He said I might have moved a division of the question— It was now too late— Giddings raised a point of order which after some discussion the Speaker dismissed it by saying— The chair overrides the point of order—the previous question was carried, 83 to 36 and the report was adopted, by yeas and nays 118 to 60— The whole transaction was a signal example of the tyranny of the rule; and of the instability of popular assemblies, affected by sudden impulses, and cramped in the freedom of speech— Immediately after this exploit the report on the rules was taken up with Dromgoole’s motion to recommit, and E J. Black’s amendment with instructions to report the 25th. rule— Rhett made a speech of 40 minutes on the right of petition and Bidlack a third of a speech which was arrested in the midst of a sentence by the expiration of the morning hour, and the call for the orders of the day— Both these Speakers were under deep agitation. Rhett, eloquent pathetic and full of absurdities Bidlack, swelling with emotions, which he had neither compass of mind nor fluency of language to express and groaning between the upper and nether millstone of servility to the South and terror of his constituents. The house then went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union R C Winthrop in the chair on the references of the parcels of the President’s message and Rathbun of New York and Thomasson hammered upon it till past four O’Clock, when the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— I commenced this evening a report to be submitted to the select Committee on the resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts.

As I went this morning to the capitol I stop’d at the house of judge Cranch and enquired of his condition— His Son John came to the door, and said he was yet in a situation very critical, but with rather more favourable symptoms than the two preceding days. Before I left my house this morning Mr Farrar a young man from Vermont came to ask of me a certificate of his qualifications for a teacher; on the authority of strong certificates to that effect from William Slade, late a member of Congress and from the Senator from that State Phelps— I declined; but he sat and questioned me about my life and adventures for upwards of an hour. Mr Collins was a visitor of much the same description, but an emigrant from Ireland imported here some thirteen years since and lately a land surveyor under Governor Wilson of Ioway— He had a voluminous manuscript, to promote the election of Mr Clay as President, which he was about to publish and for which he was soliciting subscriptions. I said that when it should be published I would perhaps take a few copies— At the House among the trashy and intrusive abortions of business that are daily usurping the place of the morning hour, M’Kay chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon an appropriation bill of 40500 dollars, to supply a deficiency in the last years appropriation for the relief and protection of American Seamen— I objected, and said there would be ample time for the passage of this bill, after the expiration of the morning hour— I called for the order of the day—whereupon Joseph R. Ingersoll moved a suspension of the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— I asked for the yeas and nays, but they were refused— The house by a vote of more than two thirds went into Committee, Wilkins in the Chair, the Bill passed in Committee without opposition; was reported to the house without amendment, and passed in the space of a quarter of an hour— I then again called up the report on the rules, and Bidlack finished his hermaphrodite hour speech the main purport of which was that he had always voted for the gag in complacency to the South as long as they adhered together, but as they were now divided he was afraid he must leave them and vote the other way. He was followed by Belser of Alabama, till the expiration of the hour— The house then went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the Message, which reported in part ten of Wise’s Resolutions and then rose—and the house adjourned.

I called twice this day at judge Cranch’s house first on my way to the Capitol, when I was informed that his condition was still extremely critical, but thought by his two physicians, Doctors Sewall and May more favourable than it had been for two preceding days— He is now in perfect possession of his mind, but was asleep and I would not disturb him— I saw his son Joseph Pearce who with his sister Mrs Rufus Dawes arrived this morning from New York— Pearce, recently married to Elizabeth de Windt, and Rufus Dawes reside together at New-York— My second call was after the adjournment of the House, when the judge was awake and I saw him— He was weaker than he had been in the morning, in a high fever, and seemed to entertain no hopes of recovery, but was calm and collected, full of gratitude to God for numberless blessings that he has enjoyed, through a long life, and ready to appear in the presence of his maker. He was much affected at seeing me grasped my hand with strong pressure at meeting and parting, and thanked me for the cheering words with which I endeavoured to revive his spirits— At the house after the reading of the journal, Mr Giddings, claimed as a right to make a statement of what he deemed a breach of privilege, by a violent attack, and false charge against him, published in the Globe of last Evening against him. Immediately the Slave representation set their faces against allowing Giddings to make any explanation— The Speaker decided that it was not a privileged question; which made it necessary for a two thirds vote to enable Giddings to defend his character against a cowardly assassin in a Newspaper published by the Printers of the House— Schenk moved a suspension of the rules for that purpose— The vote was 92 to 57. and the affirmative not carrying two thirds, Giddings was deprived of the freedom of Speech in self defence before the house— It was curious to hear several of the subterraneans vote against his having leave to explain and when they found the vote in his favour, change their votes to have the appearance on the record of having voted to hear him— Wilkins from the judiciary Committee reported a bill to extend to the district the act of Feby 1793 for the recovery of fugitive slaves and to repeal the district Law which authorizes the sale of free coloured people to pay for their jail-fees.— Saunders presented a minority report— Both were received; referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and ordered to be printed— The hour of debate on the Rules was occupied by Belser of Alabama, and Cobb of Georgia—and the rest of the day in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Winthrop in the chair on the Message, by Jameson of Missouri, till the adjournment— "

I attended public worship this morning, in the Hall of the house of Representatives, with my nephew Isaac Hull Adams, and my granddaughter Mary Louisa— Before going to the Capitol we stop’d at judge Cranch’s house and they went in, to make enquiry of his state.— He was better, but still in imminent danger. The preacher at the Capitol was the Revd. Charles W. Denison, Chaplain of the Boston Bethel Union, and Editor of the Sheet Anchor, and his discourse was on the moral improvement of Seamen— He took for his text, if, he said any text was necessary, Isaiah 60.5.—the latter part of the verse—[“]because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee.” The style of Mr Denison’s oratory is colloquial, fluent and lively— The burden of his discourse was the importance of the Seamen as a distinct class of men, in human Society— He spoke of their influence upon the happiness and the morals of the rest of mankind—of the dangers and hardships incidental to their profession—of the generosity which is their peculiar and characteristic virtue—of the reckless profusion which is their besetting sin; and of the looseness of their moral principle which admonish those whose charge it is to teach the lessons of virtue to their fellow creatures, to use their utmost exertions to train them in the paths of virtue, and rally them to the standard of religion.— He told several familiar anecdotes pathetic and amusing, illustrative of the manners, and habits and propensities of Sailors, and named several distinguished men who have risen to honour and renown from the station of common sailors, among whom was Richard H. Dana, the author of two years before the mast. He spoke much of himself as the son of a professional mariner, and of a family chiefly of Seamen; and familiar with the manners, usages, opinions and sentiments congenial to the lives and fortunes of seafaring men— After the service was over, Mr Tinsley the chaplain came and introduced him to me He said that one of his motives in coming here was to prevail upon the Government to take for the use of the Navy-Yards a large subscription to a Sailor’s Newspaper of which he is the Editor; called the Sheet-Anchor. Philanthropy ending as usual in a job— I had a morning visit from Mr Slidell the democratic member from New-Orleans— After dinner at the second Presbyterian Church I heard Mr Knox, from 2 Corinthians 5.9. Wherefore we labour, that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him— It was the remnant of a discourse commenced this morning. "

On my way to the Capitol this morning I stop’d at judge Cranch’s house, and was informed by his son John that he was so much better that they had now warm hopes of his recovery— In the house James H. Relfe of Missouri, moved to suspend the rules, for a motion to discharge the Committee of the whole from the 11th. resolution offered by Wise, for parceling out to Committees the President’s Message; at 3. O’Clock this afternoon— Ten of Wise’s Resolutions had been adopted in as many minutes in Committee, but had not been reported to the house. The 11th. opened the wide field of controversy on the question of internal improvements and has been debated now for nearly a month without seeming to approach a termination— Last Friday an attempt was made to take it out of Committee by the gag-process which failed. I then proposed that when the house should next take up in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union the partition message, they should report to the house in part the resolutions which they have adopted leaving the rest to be further discussed in Committee— This was accordingly done, and on Saturday the first ten of Wise’s Resolutions were reported to the house— Relfe however was impatient to dispose of the 11th. the apple of discord—the internal improvement of the Western waters and the Mississippi— Hence his motion to suspend the rules but it failed by Tellers 71 to 60— Next came a motion by Weller to reconsider a resolution offered by Patterson to riddle all the pigeon holes of the general Post-Office for information—to reduce the rates of Postage, and to abolish the franking privilege— This is a notion which has recently taken possession of the brains of the Northern Postage payers, and they are clamorous for reduction of the rates, and for the abolition of the franking privilege— In the debate of this day, the most important question of the concern was not touched at-all— The subject was postponed till to morrow— The states, were called through for Resolutions, and was prolific of yankee notions— I offered a call on the President for the correspondence with the government of Texas, concerning the complaint of President Houston, that our troops had broken up their Snively expedition against Santa Fe— Objection was made to my Resolution, and it lies over. E. J. Black gave notice that when the bill for organizing the Oregon territory shall come up, he will move an additional section for the provisional annexation of Texas to the United States— Cave Johnson introduced a bill to repeal the duties on Salt and the fishing bounties, and moved a reconsideration of a resolution looking to an appropriation for removing snags from the Mississippi river.

Tuesday  Mr Frye came this morning and introduced Mr Walker of Cincinnati, Ohio; who says that he saw and heard, and shook hands with me there; but whose person I did not recollect. At the house, there was a remarkable developement of a new phasis in the conflict of internal improvement— The day before yesterday came the intelligence from St Louis, Missouri, that a large Steamer, called the Shepherdess from New-Orleans struck a snag within 3 miles of St. Louis, and sunk instantly with the loss of from 40 to 100 lives— Thomasson of Kentucky, yesterday took advantage of this incident to move an instruction to the Committee of Ways and Means, to report a Bill making an appropriation for removing obstructions in the Mississippi and its tributary rivers— Thomasson made a pathetic speech about the disaster of the shepherdess, and his resolution passed without opposition, but Cave Johnson afterwards moved a reconsideration of it, and brought up again the same interminable dispute about the constitutional power of Congress, which has been already drained to the dregs in Committee of the whole on the President’s message— Wilkins of Pittsburgh had closed the debate of yesterday on the question of reconsideration— James B Bowlin of Missouri led it off in an hour speech this morning in the course of which he complained that the Committee of Ways and means had struck out the sum presented in the estimates for improvements on the western rivers Joseph R. Ingersoll and David L. Seymour of New-York, members of the Committee knew nothing of this crippling of the Estimates; but Weller of Ohio also a member of the Committee confirmed it— Andrew Stewart followed in an hour speech, urging Cave Johnson to modify his motion for reconsideration so as to refer Thomasson’s resolution of instructions, not to the committee of Ways and Means, but to the Committee of Roads and Canals— Stewart plunged into the Tariff and the Presidential election question and charged Van Buren with holding all internal improvements beyond the powers of Congress.— Stewart worried out his hour frequently interrupted by insulting comments and charges of falsehood by M’Connell, and frequently called to order by the Speaker for irrelevancy— Joseph R. Ingersoll followed him in a flowery courtly speech Kennedy of Indiana gave a new specimen of his brutal insolence, and Holmes of Charleston a specimen of his cunning casuistry. He announced an unanswerable legal argument to prove that Congress had the power to spend money for the improvement of the Mississippi, but of no other river. His authority was the Ordinance for the Northwestern Territory— "

My Catarrhal cough has returned upon with fresh severity.— I went to bed at Midnight and soon after three this morning was roused by a fit of coughing, for relief from which I was obliged to leave my bed for a few minutes, after which I returned to it, and broken sleep till six— I sent for Doctor Thomas; stated my case and asked his advice— He prescribed 3 pills a day—Morning Noon and Night. I went to the Capitol this morning at 11; and borrowed from the Law Library, the 2d. volume of Haggard’s admiralty reports; containing page 94. the case of the Slave Grace, decided by Lord Stowell in 1827. immediately before the abolition of Slavery in the British West India Colonies—by Act of Parliament— I wanted also the 20th. Volume of Howell’s State-trials, containing the case of the Negro Somersett—but the book was taken out by the Senator Rufus Choate— I found the house in Session, and Weller discoursing upon Cave Johnson’s motion to reconsider Thomasson’s resolution instructing the Committee of Ways and Means to bring in a bill appropriating money to remove obstructions in the Mississippi river and its tributaries— Weller was violent and abusive upon Stewart, and charged him directly with falsehood in his statements of Van Buren’s doctrines concerning internal improvements— Stewart replied by repeating the statements declaring that he would prove them from the Letters of Mr Van Buren himself. After a string of common-places from Thomas Smith of Indiana, Samuel F. Vinton of Ohio took the floor and in a plain sensible and moderate speech placed the question its true foundations and used up the pettifogging sophistry of Holmes. John J. Hardin of Illinois came next, and then D. D. Barnard with an argument of irresistible force, but with a stern and peremptory tone and manner which irritates even those whom it convinces— This is the drop of and in Mr Barnard’s Oratory, which curdles his eloquence— The cogency and self confidence of his argument, stung the brutal temper of Kennedy the Indiana blacksmith, who grossly insulted him, without being rebuked by the Speaker. Cave Johnson finally got the floor, and retained it unfairly—moved an amendment that the Committee of Ways and Means enquire into the expediency of the appropriation, and called for the previous question, which was carried, and the amendment and resolution were adopted— Mr and Mrs Grinnell were here this Evening— Also Mrs. Thornton—and Mrs Talbot with her daughter.

Thursday  Immediately after the reading of the Journal we had in the house one of those amiable exhibitions of good nature which the chattel representation are so much in the habit of displaying— The Colonization Society had obtained the use of the hall, and had held a meeting there last Tuesday evening. Not having finished their business then they adjourned their meeting to this evening; but the Speaker was scrupulous about the exercise of his power to dispose of the Hall, and insisted that Society must again obtain the use of the Hall, by vote of the house— Before there was a Quorum formed, Irvin of Pennsylvania, moved that the Society should have the use of the Hall— Edward J. Black of Georgia objected, saying that he regarded them all as abolitionists— Irvin explained and moved a suspension of the rules to enable him to offer the Resolution— The question was first taken by rising 76 in favour of suspending the rule—less than 20 against it, but no quorum voting— Black persisted in his purpose— A call of the house was moved and refused—a call of the yeas and nays was made and refused. At last a member moved to adjourn, and called the yeas and nays— This brought the house to— On the motion to adjourn the vote was 1 to 158. Then on the motion to suspend the rules the vote by yeas and nays was 127 to 47. and the Resolution was adopted without an adverse voice— A full hour was consumed in this miserable chicanery by Black and it is a sample of his daily manifestations of temper— There was some discussion of a resolution offered by Patterson, from Rochester, New-York, of enquiry upon the Postmaster general concerning the abuses of the franking privilege, the reconsideration of which had been moved— It was finally laid over for debate— There are many memorials and petitions calling for a reduction of the rates of postage, and the abolition or restriction of the franking privilege, but it is apparent that neither the Postmaster general nor the Chairman of the Committee intend to make any change— An hour of debate was allowed upon the report on the rules, occupied by Cobb of Georgia to finish his speech and by Charles Hudson to commence his— Then Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Winthrop in the Chair upon the Message and the Western waters.

Black came in a little before 11. stayed but a few minutes and said he wanted to make a Report against the Bill— The Committee adjourned to this day fortnight, the 2d. of February—after agreeing that Winthrop should report a Resolution to print Capen’s Memorial and five or six additional Sections which Ingersoll proposes as amendments to his bill— In the house Vance Chairman of the Committee of Claims moved a suspension of the rules for the reception of reports from Committees such as would give rise to no debate which was carried against my remonstrance, and several reports were received, among which was that of R. C. Winthrop for printing Nahum Capen’s Memorial which was adopted. I enquired of Hopkins chairman of the Committee on Post-Offices and Post-roads, whether that Committee would report a Bill to reduce the rates of Postage, and if so when it might be expected. He answered that the Committee had taken the subject into consideration, but had come to no conclusion, concerning it: nor did he know when they would report but probably in the course of a few weeks— The debate on Dromgoole’s motion to recommit, the report on the rules and Black’s amendment to instruct the Committee to report the 25th rule was resumed, and Hudson finished his hour, followed by Romulus M Saunders who clings to the rule with the grasp of death. At the expiration of the hour, it being private bill day, Cave Johnson moved the suspension of the rules to go into Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union upon the President’s Message which was carried Weller of Ohio made an hour speech of more brutal fury than I ever heard, all pointed personally at Andrew Stewart, cheered and edged on by the Van Buren majority.— Brinkerhoff of Ohio followed but soon became faint; the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Schenk told me that Weller was expelled from college for obscenity and profanity— I walked home from the Capitol— Mr Moseley spent part of the Evening with us.

Nearly three hours of my time extinguished by sleep refreshing to the time worn, care worn, diseased and exhausted body, but at the expense of the active energies of the Soul— I am pressed with the task of preparing the minority report for the Committee on the Resolves of the Massachusetts Legislature so that I find it almost impossible to keep up this Diary with the current of Time— I had hoped this morning for some leisure to make progress in this work, but I had only time for a call at the Bank of the Metropolis for my book, which I had left there to be balanced, when the hour summoned me to the house— Hughes of Missouri offered a Resolution to instruct the Committee on the Territories to enquire into the expediency of reporting as soon as possible a joint resolution requesting the President to give notice to the British Government that after 12 months the Government of the United States will annul and abrogate the Convention of 6 September 1827. Williams objected to this resolution that there was already one of the same import referred to the Committee of foreign affairs— The yeas and nays were called and refused on the motion to suspend the rules; but the resolution was rejected— Wentworth of Illinois presented a Memorial against the annexation of Texas to the United States; but said one of the memorialists had written to him that if there was any danger that England should get Texas; they were willing the United States should have it in preference— Cave Johnson moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the references of the President’s Message. I remonstrated against this claiming the morning hour for the discussion of the report on the rules; but in vain— The majority of the house are playing a game of fast and loose with me on this subject, and desert me whenever any opportunity is afforded them so to do— They went into Committee of the whole, Winthrop in the Chair; and jabbered about the western waters, and in struggles to refuse Stewart the liberty to reply to the scandalous and insolent attacks of Weller upon him yesterday. Every species of chicanery was used to deprive him of this privilege; and when granted he replied under continual interruptions and calls to order, from the majority and repeated insults and defiances to fight from M’Connell.— At two, the voting on the reference of the western waters commenced. Thomasson’s amendment to Wise’s Resolution, and all the other amendments were rejected and the original resolution of reference to the Committee of Commerce was adopted— The resolution to refer the notice of the Smithsonian bequest, to a select Committee was amended by Burke’s motion to refer it to the joint Committee on the library. The Committee reported and the house adjourned— Holmes by way of bravado immediately after Stewart concluded his speech had made a motion to instruct the judiciary Committee to enquire into the expediency of repealing the Law against duelling, which was received with a shout of laughter.

Justin Edwards said to be from Boston preached a discourse upon the sanctity of the Sabbath, from Mark 2.27. “The Sabbath was made for man.”— This question about keeping the Sabbath holy, as a day of rest is one of the numerous religious and political excitements which keep the free people of this union in perpetual agitation.— They seem to be generated by the condition of the country—in a state of profound peace— There are in this country as in all others a certain proportion of restless and turbulent spirits, poor, unoccupied, ambitious, who must always have something to quarrel about with their neighbours— These people are the authors of religious revivals— They formed in the days of Washington’s administration the germ of the Jacobin clubs— During the last War with Great Britain, they generated the Washington benevolent Societies and Peace Societies. In later times, they have bred the Masonic and anti-masonic Societies the Temperance Societies, the, Colonization, abolition and anti-Slavery Societies, and they are now beating the drum and blowing the trumpet for a holy Sabbath Society— A numerous Convention is already advertised to promote the cause, and Mr Edwards has come to preach for it in the Representative Hall— After announcing his text he said that the word Sabbath meant rest, and that it was one of the ten commandments written by the finger of God upon stone, as Laws for all men, that after every six days of labour there should be one day of rest.— He dwelt exclusively upon the commandment, which he said was a law of nature for man and for beast who could perform more labour enjoy more health and live longer upon six days of labour, and one of rest than upon seven successive days of labour— His illustrations were numerous and his zeal intense and evidently sincere; but he took no notice of the exposition of the true meaning of the commandment when his own disciples were charged with the violation of it— Isaac Hull, and my Granddaughter went with me to the Hall— Mr Tustin the Chaplain of the Senate was with the preacher, and gave out and sung the hymn— After the service I returned the visit of Mr Daniel Webster at his house and had a conversation with him of upwards of an hour— After dinner I attended at the Presbyterian Church, and heard a Mr Smith from New York discourse upon the sufferings of Jesus, the marred countenance—the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.

In my earnestness to recover the encroachment of time upon my Diary record, and yet make progress in my report to be ready before the first of February, I was this day belated half an hour in my attendance at the house— I found it in Session— It was the day for the reception of petitions, and the Speaker who had begun with the Territory of Ioway had already reached the State of Ohio in his call— Douglass of Indiana had made a report from the Committee of Elections had made a report on the contested elections, and Garret Davis had promised a minority report— Elmer the ostensible chairman of the Committee had given notice that he would call up the report for consideration to-morrow, two weeks— Giddings presented several anti-slavery and abolition-petitions; among the rest one from 381 citizens of Hampshire County, Massachusetts, praying Congress by law to prohibit the officers of the United States from assisting to arrest persons suspected of being fugitives from Slavery There was much fluttering among the Slavers The Speaker decided that this petition was not within the 25th. rule— From which decision Black of Georgia appealed— I called for the yeas and nays— Saunders attempted to raise the question of reception, but the Speaker said it was too late— Jameson enquired if laying the appeal on the table would carry the petition with it— The Speaker said no— Wilkins said there was just such a petition referred to the Committee on the judiciary— Payne moved to lay the appeal on the table carried 113 ayes He then made the question of reception and Cave Johnson moved to lay that on the table— This is the wooden nutmeg form of rejecting a petition, without refusing to receive it— The question to lay on the table was lost 85 to 87 and then the question to receive was lost 85 to 86. In the interval between the two takings of yeas and nays Freedom lost two votes Slavery gained one, and the majority was changed— Beardsley presented a petition praying for the repeal of the act of February 1793 for catching fugitive Slaves— Thompson moved the question of reception and Weller moved to lay it on the table— Beardsley moved a call of the house—and Hopkins moved to adjourn, and it was carried— Another slip of the rattlesnake Slavery from the grasp of Freedom— I dined at General Almonte’s the Mexican Minister, with a company of Ladies and Gentlemen—Mr D. D. Barnard—Mr and Mrs. B. Ogle Tayloe—Mr and Mrs Gales and Miss Walker—Mr and Mrs Seaton, and their daughter—young Yturbide and his two sisters; Mr Cos secretary of the Mexican legation, Miss Cutts, and sundry others— My wife and daughter Mary were invited, but declined— A magnificent dinner— Dancing after.

                "text": "23. V. Tuesday.  I had received last evening a note from Mr Daniel R Goodloe of North-Carolina requesting an interview with me for which I appointed ten O’Clock this morning. He came accordingly with a manuscript of 26 folio pages, of which he said he was the author which he was desirous of publishing in a pamphlet; and of which he wished me to give my opinion.— He pointed out to me a page or two, which I read, and which contained the essence of his Essay, and left the manuscript with me, to call again to morrow— I promised to read the manuscript in the interval, and to give him my opinion of the expediency of publishing it— A poor Negro came in a state almost of distraction, to implore me to save his wife from being sold away. I asked him how I could do that? He said by purchasing her myself; for 400 dollars— I told him that was impossible. The poor fellow went away in despair— Two Young men, one named M’Rae, and the other Hamilton, came with a Letter of introduction from John G. Palfrey, now Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Letter is dated at Cambridge, and they were students at the Law School there— Immediately after the reading of the journal, Charles J. Ingersoll chairman of the Committee of foreign affairs instantly moved a suspension of the Rules to receive Reports from Committees— Cave Johnson suggested to him to confine his motion to one hour, to which he readily assented— Their object was to supersede the debate on the rules and smuggle it out of the way. I knew it would be in vain to oppose the movement directly and the suspension was carried without opposition— Holmes, Chairman of the Committee of Commerce asked from that Committee, leave to employ a Clerk— Half an hour of piddling debate and the motion laid on the table. C. J. Ingersoll reported from the Committee of foreign Affairs against a Resolution offered by Robert Dale Owen, and referred to that Committee—to request the President to give 12 months notice to the British Government that we will abrogate the agreement of mutual occupation of the Oregon territory— The report of the Committee is that it is inexpedient for Congress to take any action whatever upon the subject at present— No sooner was the Resolution of the Committee read than Owen came out with a set speech against it, and as the hour drew to a close when he moved a second suspension of the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the Union, for him to continue his speech—this barely failed for want of two thirds 111 to 63. I called the order of the morning hour— Saunders finished and Winthrop began. "

I cannot keep pace in my Diary with the lapse of time, and was obliged to break off my record in the middle—yesterday— This morning Mr Goodloe called on me— I had read carefully his manuscript, and expressed to him the very favourable opinion of it which I entertained. And I candidly made to him some remarks on what I thought deficient in his illustrations— Mr Lewis Johnson was here, and gave me three checks of the Bank of the Metropolis, each for 50 dollars payable to my order, on the Merchant’s Bank at Boston for which I gave him 3 receipts signed by Norton Quincy Thaxter—as received from Lewis Johnson administrator to the Estate of William Otis—one for Mr Thaxter himself—one for Felipe Ximenes and Ellen M. C. Ximenes, and one for Josephine O. Cogley.— These, with Mr Thaxter’s wife, are the children of Nathaniel Otis, one of William Otis’s brothers, by a Spanish West India woman whom he married in the Island of Cuba— I had received the receipts a few days since in a Letter from Mr Thaxter. At the house immediately after the reading of the journal, I called for the order of the day, Hopkins made an attempt to set it aside but failed. Garret Davis made a minority report from the Committee of elections on the question of the members elected by general ticket from the four States. Campbell moved the printing of 5000 copies of both reports— But the Speaker said the motion was not in order, and objection was made. His motion was not received— The report on the rules was resumed— Winthrop finished his hour speech; an excellent one, but repeatedly interrupted by the addle headed blunders of Rhett, about a precedent from Hatsell in 1665.— Winthrop was followed by W. W. Payne of Alabama in support of the rule— As he was closing half a dozen members started up, among whom the Speaker recognized Joseph A. Wright of Indiana, who began in so low and tame a tone of voice that I could not hear what he said. But the Speaker immediately told him the morning hour had expired. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Campbell of South-Carolina in the chair— Robert Dale Owen, the Scotch Atheist finished his hour speech for abrogating the Oregon joint occupation Convention— Thomasson just hinted objections. In the meantime I had gone into the Senate chamber and asked Mr Choate for the 20th. volume of Howell’s State trials which he afterwards sent me. On my return to the house I found Wentworth roaring like a bull buffalo about the Oregon territory; but nobody followed him— Parmenter acting as chairman of the Naval Committee called up the bill for authorising the President to transfer Naval Appropriations, which started an amusing debate, which came to no conclusion— C. J. Ingersoll gave notice of a negro catch pole bill— I spent the Evening with Mary and Isaac Hull, at Mr Cutts’s— "

He had yesterday written me a note requesting to see me again on the subject, and brought with him this morning a couple of pages, which he thought would supply the deficiency which I thought necessary to complete his Essay.— I thought there was still something wanting, but that his work was ingenious; his views in some respects new to me, and well worthy of publication— Brown the poor man for whom at the last Session I had procured the passage of a bill in the house, which failed in the Senate, came with a copy of the Bill, and of the Report of the Committee of the house in his favour, came to request that I would call it up again in the house, which I promised to do—and did— On my way to the house I stop’d at the Patriotic Bank, and found that my draft on the Frederic Hotel Stock had been paid, and was credited, with a small charge at Frederic for collection to me as Executor of Thomas B. Johnson\\, at the Patriotic Bank— As I do owe a credit to Mr Johnson’s estate, I left it thus charged though received as administrator to my son John, whose Estate is indebted to me. At the house immediately after the reading of the journal, I called for the order of the day— But Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus Elmer accidental chairman of the Committee of Elections, presented a report on the contested election of Goggin and Gilmer, closing with a Resolution declaring Gilmer duly-elected.— He moved that the report should be referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and printed— And he moved that the Memorials presented to the Committee on their first meeting by both parties should be printed— Goggin is said to be sick at home— His friend Willoughby Newton objected to the printing of his memorial because it rested on a state of facts which Goggin had reason to believe true, but disproved by subsequent evidence. The motive for printing it now, being to prejudice the public mind against Goggin at home—in his own district. This gave rise to an acrimonious debate of 3 hours, the result of which was by yeas and nays to order the printing of both memorials, and also of the testimony. Schenk obtained leave to make a minority report on the same case— I then struggled to get up the report on the rules, But the house refused to take them or any thing else up and adjourned— Dr Thomas was here this evening and prescribed for my cough— Mr Grinnell and Richard Peters were also here— "

I received this morning a Letter from my Son, enclosing one from Petty Vaughan, to Mr Curtis and me as Executors of Ward Nicholas Boylston, and a power of Attorney from his as assignee, by a deed of assignment of 1. Feby 1824. from George Lee, surviving assignee of Lane and Co. to Mr Curtis and me jointly and severally as Executors of W. N. Boylston, to receive 979 dollars, of unclaimed dividends on United States stocks, standing on the books in the Office of Register of the Treasury, standing in the name of George Lee, George Erving and Thomas Latham— The discovery of this credit was made by the same Charles D. Lewis of New-York who gave me notice last October of the dividend standing on the same books in the name of my father— In the present case Mr Lewis applied to Alfred Latham son of Thomas Latham; deceased, but who had been the last survivor of the assignees of Lane and Co. in whose bankruptcy Thomas Boylston was involved and whose assignment was by then finally assigned to Ward N. Boylston— Alfred Latham referred Charles D. Lewis to Petty Vaughan who consequently sent this power to Mr Curtis and me, and agreed if we should recover the sum of 979 dollars, Mr Lewis should receive 100 dollars of the prize—he had demanded 25 per cent— I went immediately to the Register’s Office with the power from Petty Vaughan—the entry on the books was immediately found and I received a check on the Bank of the Metropolis, for 979 dollars 78 cents— They retained at the Office the power from P. Vaughan. These transactions furnish a theme upon which I would gladly comment, but I must go ahead— In the house Charles J. Ingersoll bolted a whole day’s debate, by calling on the Speaker to turn out of the house Nathan Sargent, Reporter for the United States Gazette of Philadelphia under the signature of Oliver Oldschool, for what he charged to be a false report, but which was an exactly true report of the scene in the house last Tuesday—when he asked the question whether I was the author of the Massachusetts Resolutions of last Winter against the Slave Representation, and without answering him I turned away and called for the yeas and nays.— Ingersoll made no motion, and there was no question before the house—and when called on to specify the part of the report which he charged with falsehood—he said, the whole— I declared to the house that the motive imputed to me by the reporter for not answering the question was true—that I did consider the question as a piece of impertinence, and therefore did not answer it— After three hours of debate, without any question before the house, and numerous struggles to get rid of it, baffled by the joint partiality and imbecility of the Speaker, it was at last disposed of by a large vote of indefinite postponement. I then called up the report on the rules; but the house would not second me. It was postponed till to-morrow—and the house adjourned. Mr D. P. King and Dr Brewer were here this Evening. The doctor goes for Boston to-morrow. "

Fahrenheit 10 at Sunrise  Mr Sargent called on me this morning to thank me for having interposed yesterday, against the brutal and cowardly assault of Charles J. Ingersoll, upon his character, in which, afterwards Wise, with equal baseness joined. The day before this sally of Ingersoll, Weller, with Payne and Belser of Alabama, aiding, abetting and edging him on, had knocked down beaten and wounded another Reporter and Letter writer, named Shriver, for a Report in the Baltimore Patriot of Weller’s infamous treatment of Stewart last week— And some days before, Jones the Speaker had displaced Mr Leavitt from the place assigned to him. The simple truth is that the ruffians of the house cannot bear the exposure of their villainies by the press, and they combine with the Speaker to silence or smother its voice.— In the midst of the Babel talk of Charles J. Ingersoll yesterday Cave Johnson offered a new rule, that no Reporters shall be admitted within the Hall, except those for the city papers— That was not in order, but he gave notice that he would offer it this day, which he did— Edward J. Black of Georgia, moved as an amendment a rule for the appointment of Reporters to be Officers of the house; and prescribing in ridiculous detail what they shall report— The Speaker did not favour either Cave Johnson’s or Black’s resolution; the object of both of them being to strangle the freedom of debate in the house and of the press out of it— Wise presented his minority report from the Committee on the Rules—signed he said by two members—(himself and Chapman—) The report was ordered to be printed— Charles J. Ingersoll wanted to say something about this minority report, but was not permitted. The report on the rules was taken up; Joseph A. Wright of Indiana made a feeble half hour speech against the gag-rule, and William H. Stiles began a long concoted and elaborate speech in support of it.— The house went into Committee of the whole on private bills, and passed one into the house; besides debating nearly an hour whether certain bills on that calendar were private or public bills. Then followed a long debate on a bill, reported by Parmenter from the Naval Committee, for the relief of the widows and orphans of the Officers, Seamen and Marines of the Schooner Grampus lost at Sea— Levy the delegate from Florida moved to add those of the Sea-Gull— The debate continued, Gilmer in the chair till past 4. O’Clock, and the Committee rose without reporting, and the house adjourned. I dined with Mr Grinnell and Mr Winthrop at their lodgings. Mr Bates the Senator, and George Evans of Maine are of the mess— In the Evening Mr and Mrs Grinnell went with me to the Amateur Charity concert "

Snowy day—  After the plenteous, indulgence of gastronomy of yesterday’s dinner, and the liberal disposal of the evening at the amateur charity concert, I rose this morning with the Sun, less troubled with my cough, more refreshed and more vigorous than I have been for many days. St. John’s church which has for several months undergoing repairs was this day first reopened for public worship, and Mrs John Adams, with her daughter Mary Louisa, and Isaac H. Adams attended the morning service there— I rode to the Hall of the house of Representatives, and there heard Mr Tinsley the Chaplain of the house, preach from Romans 10.10. “For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness: and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation”— He said he should confine his remarks to the first clause of the verse, and his discourse would be on Faith— The text was extremely well selected— The idea that Faith commences in the heart and terminates in righteousness presents a new view of the subject, prolific of illustration— If I can ever find the time I will write a second Lecture on Faith—in elucidation of this view— That Faith is always an impulse of the heart, and that its tendency is always to a virtuous conclusion— Apply the principle to belief in the existence of God—to the immortality of the Soul, and to the doctrines of Christianity— All this tends to righteousness— But apply it to the divinity of Jesus Christ, to the Trinity; to transubstantiation to the doctrine of an infallible head to the church—in all this there is no tendency to righteousness— Mr Tinsley did not take this view of his text— His sermon was very short and superficial rather telling his auditory what Faith is not, than what it is— He said that mere belief in Christ, and even in his religion was not Faith—for the devils believe and tremble &c— The hall was very thin, and there was a light snow, which continued through the day and cleared off in the evening— After dinner, I attended at the Presbyterian Church, where Mr Knox preached, I believe from Romans 13.11 “And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep”— Mr Knox is earnest and impressive— He gave notice that the communion would be administered next Sunday in the afternoon— Mr John Connell, and Mr Richard Cutts spent part of this evening here. The cold weather has got into the house, and pinches my fingers, so as to disable them for writing, without extreme difficulty— Time still sweeps along— How shall my record keep pace with him? "

Smith of Illinois proposing to instruct one of the Committees to enquire into the expediency of having a distribution of the biennial Register; which at my suggestion he modified into a call on the Secretary of State for the reasons why the biennial register has not been delivered on the first week in Jany according to the joint-resolution for its publication, which was adopted— Julius W. Blackwell moved that from and after the first Monday in February the hour of daily meeting should be 11.

Cranston moved as amendment the first of May; and half the day was consumed in struggles to get up a debate and vote on these proposals which every soul present knows can come to nothing.— Hale moved to instruct the military committee to report a bill to abolish the military academy at West Point— There were as usual, swarms of embryo and abortion resolutions, without purpose of utility or chance of success.— Adjourned, shortly after 4.— I dined at Dr Thomas’s with a company of 17 persons Mrs Hill, Mr and Mrs Charles Hill, and Miss Ellen Ann Hill— Mr and Mrs Hutchins, Miss Bernabeu, Miss Yturbide, Miss Stewart, General Scott, Captain Casey, Mr Ringgold and others— Evening at Mr F. Markoe’s, a Meeting of the members of the National Institute, at which I was chairman— It was voted again to hold the anniversary Meeting of several days in April next. "

Tuesday  Fahrenheit at Sunrise 30—  I am yet cramped by the continuance of the cold, somewhat abated by the ascent of the thermometer to the temperature of snow— Between the preparation of my report on the Massachusetts Resolves, and keeping time with my daily record the labour is more than Herculean, and my correspondence is almost entirely suspended— Five days in the week the Report of the Committee on the rules is the first business in order to be transacted in the house; and if I were to be absent one day when it would be called up, it would be laid upon the table without redemption— When I call it up scarce a day passes but some dirty trick is devised to postpone the taking of the question— This day Stiles of Georgia finished his hour speech, and 23 minutes were left of the morning hour— A. Johnson of Tennessee another Slave holder obtained the floor and said he wished to deliver his whole speech at once, and so he moved to postpone the further consideration of the subject till to-morrow, against which I remonstrated in vain— I hear it said that they intend to keep off the question upon the rules till after my report upon the Resolves of the Massachusetts Legislature— This policy is a hint for the modification of mine.— The house went into committee of the whole on the state of the Union John Campbell in the chair, upon the bill reported by Parmenter from the Naval Committee, authorising the Secretary of the Navy to transfer 200000 dollars from one head of specific appropriation to another— Say from pay to repairs of ships.— Cave Johnson led off an opposition to the bill, seconded by Hopkins, and then by Barnard— An Amendment, and an amendment to the amendment were moved; till it called up Wise, in aid of Parmenter— Wise delivered a dissertation upon the usefulness and glory of the navy; with a general panegyric upon its officers, and especially upon the midshipmen and passed midshipmen, all of whom he pronounced fully qualified to be Admirals. All which was mere whip’d syllabub— The amendment, and amendment to the amendment were both rejected, and the bill was reported to the house, when it was ordered to be engrossed—the question upon its passage came up; and a motion to adjourn prevailed— I had a long evening visit from Mr Bache who has been appointed superintendent of the Coast survey in place of F. Hassler "

The cold continues, and with it my difficulties to keep pace in writing with time— I brought up my diary, but fall into arrears with my report on the Massachusetts Resolves—the subject as usual widening as I proceed. Mr John Connell was here this morning to request once more my aid to get through the bill for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton—a desperate concern. Mr Lewis Johnson came, and I returned to him the three receipts of Norton Quincy Thaxter for the three checks on the Merchant’s Bank, which I have not yet found time to enclose to him— I hurried up to the Capitol to be there at the meeting of the house— The report on the rules was immediately taken up, and Andrew Johnson a new member from Tennessee made an hour speech in support of the gag-rule. and especially abusive upon me. So they all are.— I am compelled not only to endure it with seeming insensibility, but to forbear so far as I can restrain myself from all reply— This man took at once the ground that Congress have no power to abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia, because the Legislatures of Virginia and Maryland had no such power before their cessions of the two parts of the district to the United States— All the arguments of the speech were upon a level with this.— When he finished William C. M’Causlen took the floor—but the hour had expired and there was a call for the orders of the day.— But Edmund Burke, moved that the Speaker should be directed to adjourn the house at two O’Clock— There was some objection made and he withdrew his motion— Another member renewed it, and it was adopted without opposition— It was to allow members to attend the obsequies of Mrs Redding, wife of John R. Redding another of the spurious members from New-Hampshire— I went in to the Library to look into the Madison papers. They had only one copy of the work there, and that was in use by Mr Rhett. They borrowed it for me for five minutes, and I found in two of the volumes, the Leaves doubled down ready to my hand; but Mr Rhett could not spare the book, and on my way home I stop’d at Taylor’s and bought the book. Isaac Munro, with John G. Proud and his Son, brought me a gold headed cane, with a flattering Letter from the banner Clay Committee at Baltimore— I was extremely grateful for the Letter and the compliment but declined accepting the cane.

The attendance was punctual, and by a quarter past ten, all the members of the Committee were assembled in the chamber of the Committee of manufactures, except Thomas W. Gilmer, who came in a quarter of an hour later— I moved an adjournment to this day week, on two grounds— First, that since the last meeting of the Committee I had received a new set of Resolves from the present Legislature of Massachusetts of the same import with those of the last Legislature with one exception which was merely the correction of an error by the introduction of the word including, instead of the word excluding with reference to Indians.— Secondly that I had not yet finished the draft of a Report which I proposed to submit to the consideration of the committee— I had twice attempted unsuccessfully to obtain the reference to this Committee by the house of the new Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts— Next Monday will be the regular day for presenting them to the house, and I shall then again move their reference to this Committee— Gilmer was very urgent to make immediate report, and had one ready but would not read it until mine should be read. I stated what the general purport of my argument would be; and Gilmer read a part of his report, to justify the refusal to receive petitions— After much discussion Ingersoll moved to adjourn to this day fortnight, which was carried 6. to 3. Burke and Burt voting with Gilmer, and Ingersoll and Garret Davis with our minority of four. Gilmer moved again to report the journal of the Committee now to the house— Rejected 6. to 3. the same vote as on the adjournment— In the house, M’Causelen, a half-way house man, between Slavery and Freedom, occupied not quite the whole hour in a speech on both sides of the question but inclining against retaining the gag-rule from motives of expediency.— When he finished Giddings rose and after some chicanery obtained the floor; but had barely time to commence his speech when the morning hour expired. The bill authorising the transfer of naval appropriations was on its passage for engrossment and after the adoption of an amendment proposed by Milton Brown passed by yeas and nays 101. to 68. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Campbell in the Chair— Indian appropriation Bill— No conclusion. "

Winthrop the chairman, that the meeting was adjourned to this day week the 9th. I should have mentioned yesterday that the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, it was at the motion of Hughes of Missouri to take up the Resolution reported by the Committee of foreign Affairs, of the inexpediency of meddling with the Oregon territory questions at this time.— but the Committee by a vote of 60 to 59. refused to take it up.— Then at the motion of M’Kay, chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, they took up the Indian Appropriation Bill and made some progress in the consideration of that— This morning, the report of the Committee on the Rules was taken up; and Mr Giddings finished his hour speech, which he had barely commenced yesterday.— When he finished William H Hammett of Mississippi took the floor; but the hour was expiring, and a message came in from the Senate, announcing the death of Alexander Porter, a Senator from the State of Louisiana, whereupon Slidell the member from New-Orleans, read a cold blooded obituary eulogy upon the deceased, Joseph Vance of Ohio pronounced another short frothy panegyric upon him, and the usual resolutions were adopted to wear crape and to adjourn. Porter was one of the uptarts of Fortune who compose the Government of this Union— He was an Irishman—son of a patriot executed in one of the Irish rebellions, and emigrated with his mother first to Tennessee and then to Louisiana— He was a man of fine talents, amiable disposition, pleasant temper, benevolent heart elegant taste and classical acquirements— His death is a grievous loss to the Country, for he will be succeeded by a Stinkard. After the adjournment, I went first into Law Library and looked into Lofft’s reports for the case of the negro James Somerset; and then into the Supreme Court where Walter Jones was opening the case of Stephen Girard’s bequest to the City of Philadelphia— Jones is for the heirs of Girard, and was as drowsy as the sound of falling waters— Mr Webster gave me one of the printed statements of the case.— In the evening at the special request of Mr Wines I attended at Concert Hall, his second Lecture on the civil polity of the Hebrews and the Law of Moses— Thin Auditory.

The Speaker more cunning than David himself told him that his motion was not in order— David looked round the house for countenance, but found none— I doubt if he will ever renew his motion— If he does and the Slavers do not instantly lay it on the table, it will start a question of the severest trial that I have ever undergone.— I ought perhaps to pray that it may not come— If it does, I pray for Prudence and Fortitude— No intemperance— No flinching— David was silenced for this time— The report on the rules should have come up; but Chapman of Alabama moved its postponement first to Monday and next till Tuesday, on a pretence that Hammett who had the floor was unwell, though Hammett himself made no such pretence. I called for the yeas and nays, but the postponement was carried 133 to 40.— They wait for the Maryland members— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the Grampus bill— Gilmer in the chair— John P. Hale made a thorough going radical speech against the navy.— Holmes foamed at the mouth about the Grampus having sailed from Charleston, when she was lost. An amendment was carried, striking out the brothers and sisters from the relatives to be relieved, and the bill was reported and passed notwithstanding Mr Hale’s demagoguism about the poor People of New-Hampshire. Hale’s democracy will nevertheless do good service at the present juncture. "

Snow  I attended public worship this morning with Mrs John Adams and her daughter Mary Louisa—at the Hall of the House of Representatives— Mr Tustin preached, from Exodus 20.8. [“]Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” His subject was the same with that of Mr Justin Edwards the Sunday before last, but neither of them appears to me to understand the true character of the institution, or the import of the precept— The answer of Jesus Christ himself to the charge against his disciples of violating the Sabbath, gave the true measure of its design. He gave an instance of a case in which David under the craving of hunger had broken through the positive injunction of the law, which reserved the shew-bread in the sanctuary for the use of the priests, and then he added that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath— It is a day of rest from the ordinary labours of the week; but not a day of useless idleness, or of exemption from the duties of social life; of Justice, benevolence, and humanity. To a minister of religion himself, instead of being a day of idleness or even of repose it is emphatically a day of labour, and there is no portion of time more suitable for the performance of any service of kindness and beneficence to others, than the Sabbath day— Neither Mr Tustin nor Mr Edwards understand this— They receive the commandment in its rigour to the letter and condemn the mind of man to total inaction one day in seven— And they subject his body, to the same Law— This doctrine is so unreasonable that the common sense of mankind revolts against it— The attempt to make this periodical idleness an article of religion is not merely fruitless—it produces aversion to the religion itself of which this is given out as a precept— Mr Edwards for preaching the same doctrine in a church here on the evening of the same day on which he had delivered it in the Hall, bred a riot which insulted and silenced him. The hall this day was well filled, by a respectable auditory— After dinner I attended at St. John’s Church where Mr Hawley read the evening prayer for Septuagesima Sunday and made a brief exhortation from Matthew 11.28. [“]Come unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you”—taken from the communion service which had been administered this morning.— Mr Hawley is recovering from a long and severe illness, and is very feeble. The Church is entirely renovated— Richard S. Cutts was here this Evening. "

Monday  This was at the house the regular day, for the call of the States for petitions— Vance Chairman of the Committee of claims proposed to vary the order of business and begin with a call upon the Committees for Reports, but that met with no favour— Levy the Jew blustered up again with his motion to suspend the rules only for one hour to introduce his hopeful resolution—to direct the Committee of foreign affairs to enquire into the expediency of a recommendation by the house to the President of the United States to signify to the Government of Great-Britain the wish of this Government that the tenth Article of the Treaty of Washington be terminated. Levy said he wanted an hour that the chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs might have something to say on the subject. But C. J. Ingersoll stood mute, and the Jew took nothing by his motion— I asked him to show me the documents upon which he based his proposal— It was a correspondence between the U.S. Marshal for East-Florida, and the Governor of New-Providence, on a demand by the Marshal for the surrender of seven negroes who escaped from St. Augustine, and were indicted for robbery and murder at Quay Biscayine on their way to Nassau— The surrender was refused because no evidence against the negroes was produced except the indictment— I doubt whether the Slavers will allow a debate on this subject in the house; and am inclined to believe that the best policy would be to let them terminate the tenth Article of the Treaty— The call for petitions began with a call of the house moved by Beardsley, upon a motion by Weller to lay on the table an objection to the reception of a petition from Oneida County presented by Beardsley, broken off by an adjournment at the last call for petitions.— Beardsley now renewed the motion for a call of the house which they refused, and by yeas and nays 97 to 80 laid the objection to reception on the table. The call proceeded from New-York northward— I offered the Massachusetts Resolutions of the present Session— Burt objected to their being received; and after much chicanery, by yeas and nays they laid on the table the objection 74 to 91. I presented sundry other petitions one of which in the identical words of the last years Massachusetts Resolutions, was received and referred to the committee—to another objection made and reception refused 73 to 75. I moved a call of the house; refused and adjourned.— A man by the name of George Snyder came with a subscription book for a view of Religions— Portuguese Minister here. "

Hammett an Irish transfer, from the State of Mississippi, wore out his hour of insolence and vulgarity for the restoration of the 25th. rule—at the close of which Luther Severance of Maine took the floor—but the hour was gone, and Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus Elmer, chairman of the Committee of Elections, called up the report of that Committee on the contested general ticket elections—a privileged subject which is to override every thing else— The first atchievement was to take it out of the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to which it had been referred, and where the previous question could not be started. Dromgoole made the motion— Elmer acquiesced. Campbell feebly objected. Schenk Garrett Davis and Barnard, protested— Campbell questioned the right of the members whose seats were contested to vote, on the score of interest Beardsley sitting as Speaker decided it against him, and the house by yeas and nays 117 to 62 sustained the Speaker.— By a similar, though not quite so strong a vote, the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union was discharged, 107 to 73. and Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus bestowed all his tediousness upon the house till four O’Clock when they adjourned— Kennedy the Indiana blacksmith said he wanted no debate— He is the bravest cutthroat of the gang.

Wednesday  At the house, before the chaplain appeared Mr Hudson came to my seat and told me that he had heard the democracy had in a new caucus determined to take immediately the question on the restoration of the gag rule— That Dromgoole would withdraw his motion to recommit the report and will move the previous question— The New-York democrats have been whipped in, by the threat that the South will desert Van Buren, if his friends join to rescind the rule, with a promise of Calhoun and his party to support Van Buren if the rule is retained and the tariff broken down— I have been prepared for this reverse, and must bear it with patience. But this day the report on the rules, and every thing else was overridden by the zeal of Mr Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus Elmer, who upon his high horse of privilege was so intent upon being delivered of the remnant of his hour speech in support of his senseless majority report on the general ticket elections, that he would not even suffer Charles J. Ingersoll to make his report from the Committee of foreign affairs on the portuguese Treaty question about the meaning of the words like articles. Elmer finished his hour speech, and was followed by Belser of Alabama, a man of his own kidney, but whom a single spark not yet extinct in his mind, of common sense has kept him right in this case; and he made an hour speech in support of the Law. Paul Dillingham junr. a Vermont democrat sophisticated not quite an hour for the spurious elections and Joseph A. Woodward of South-Carolina, twisted words and ideas into a snarl on the same side— Milton Brown of Tennessee, and Jacob Collamer of Vermont recurred to some of the principles of common honesty, till past 4. O’Clock, when after two previous refusals of the house to adjourn Samuel Beardsley took the floor and moved to adjourn, and it was carried— I had an evening visit from Mr Murray of New-York with Mr Charles Butler a brother of Benjamin F. Butler, the sometime Attorney General of Mr Van Buren. He told me that he was a loco foco—but warmly and anxiously with me, on the right of petition— I received while those Gentlemen were here a note from a Mr Wakeman, requesting an interview with me, for which I appointed to morrow morning at 9. O’Clock. "

Mr Wakeman came and had a full hour’s conversation with me. He is a young man from Herkimer County in the State of New-York—an entire Stranger to me; but whose object was to ask questions of my opinions upon various subjects chiefly relating to Slavery, and also of advice to him for his own conduct— He said he was in very narrow circumstances, but was desirous of devoting himself to the profession of the Law. His most immediate and urgent enquiry was whether his best course would be to commence off-hand the study of the Law, or to begin by acquiring the preliminary foundation of a college education— I told him that if his purpose was to become eminent in the profession, he must lay his foundation broad and deep. He must commence by making himself master of college learning; but if he aspired to nothing further than qualification for the practice of a village lawyer, he might pick up his classical and his law learning together, and with an industrious use of the long and tedious leisure which he would have in waiting for employment of all his time in practise he could easily gather general and particular knowledge, at the same time.— Mr Espy the storm-breeder came with a complaint that the Committee of Ways and Means were about to retrench the appropriation for some small interloping office under the War department with which he has been allowed for the last two years to pursue his study of Storms. He said he had cotemporaneous observations made at 150 military stations the results of which he had reported to the Secretary of War, and his report had been communicated with that of the Secretary accompanying the President’s annual message to Congress—and he shewed me ninety engraved maps on which were marked the direction of all the storms at the several Stations of observation, all confirmative of his theory— At the house the day was again consumed on the general ticket election question— Beardsley, Henry Grider of Kentuckey, Caleb B Smith of Indiana, G. W. Jones of Tennessee, Howell Cobb of Georgia, and Willoughby Newton of Virginia, successively occupying the floor till 5. O’clock and the adjournment— In the evening, with Mary and her daughter, Hull and Walter at the concert of the Hutchinsons. "

The concert last Evening was of the Hutchinson family—three men, brothers and one girl of 16 or 17. a sister, part of a family of 13 children born and raised in New Hampshire.— One of the brothers plays on the violin and sings, another on the violencello and sings. The third growls the base and they sing trios, and some times quartetts with the sister, grave and gay, pathetic and doggerel, with words and music composed by or for themselves— They sent me five tickets for myself and my family, by Mr Hale, a member of the house from New-Hampshire with an urgent invitation to attend— After the concert was over the eldest of the brothers came, introduced himself to me and thanked me for attending.— I thought the favour was on my side— Mr Lewis Johnson came this morning with an authenticated affidavit of the widow of N. W. Otis, at New-Orleans claiming for herself and five children shares of the estate of William Otis— Mr Johnson said he would enclose them under cover to Mr N. Q. Thaxter at Hingham, and send them to me.— At half past ten I attended the meeting of the Committee on Copy rights— Bowlin of Missouri, Herrick of Maine and Potter of Ohio absent— Winthrop read C. J. Ingersoll’s Bill andSections of amendment to it printed since the last meeting of the Committee and consisting of an entire but most incongruous system of copy right property; fit for nothing but to multiply litigation, and not even touching upon the subject first referred to the committee, a Memorial for an international copyright Law— After the reading of the Bill and amendments I suggested a question of the expediency of any change in the existing copy-right Laws— But there was not time to discuss the question, and the Committee adjourned to meet again when notified by the Chairman— The house again consumed the day on the general ticket election question— Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, and A. H. Stevens of Georgia, Aaron Vail Brown of Tennessee and Samuel Chilton of Virginia, alternated for an against the resolution reported by the majority of the Committee of Elections, confirming the spurious members in their seats. Washington Hunt of New York closed this days debate against them. At 5. O’Clock Moses Norris junr of New Hampshire took the floor, and the house adjourned— I had borrowed an hour from this nauseous debate to visit the US Supreme Court and hear the plain sense and temperate argument of John Sergeant in the case of S.

I called this morning at the Office of the first comptroller, M’Culloch at the Treasury Department to urge upon him as far as was within my competency, the equitable claims of the legal representatives of William Otis to a further allowance for interest, on the amount of his claim, which has been allowed and paid— I went at the request of Mr Lewis Johnson the Administrator—and expressed to the comptroller my opinion and my desire that the further allowance of interest should be made in order that justice so far as it is within the power of the government to administer it should be done to the claim a man utterly ruined and who died in prison, for the faithful discharge of his duty as a public officer; with a large sum of money due to him as is now acknowledged, due to him by the Government at the time of his death— Mr M’Culloch stated, that there had been repeated settlements of this claim before he came into office; and one since, by him with the late Francis Key, Counsel for the Administrator— This settlement allowed all that Mr Key had claimed and he was perfectly satisfied with it—but in order to sanction it the opinion of the late Attorney General Legaré had been taken— This was generally unfavourable to the claim but contained an intimation that the claim if just as then presented was good, it would be so for more interest, and this he took to be the origin and only foundation of the present claim— He promised, however to revise his decision on the case and to refer it again to the present Attorney General for his opinion— I deposited at the Patriotic Bank 13. Notes at 60. 75 and 90 days from the 11th. of December, the day of the Sale of Mr T. B. Johnson’s effects—those at 60 days, being payable next Tuesday.— I left them for collection— I called next at the Office of the Register of the Orphans Court, and left the Bill of Doctor Hall sworn to by him, for medical attendance upon Mr T B. Johnson— I thought it necessary to have the certificate of the judge that it should pass, before paying it. I was promised it should be sent to me next Tuesday. At the house the everlasting general ticket election again consumed the day.— Moses Norris junr. of New-Hampshire wasted the first hour, Abraham Chappell of Georgia, and George H. Catlin of Connecticut the second— They were followed by George W. Summers of Virginia in a speech of sound sense and honest principle—after which came the heavy stupidity and coarse vulgarity of John Jameson of Missouri; closing for the day with John H. Lumpkin of Georgia till the adjournment after 5— I made an escape from the house while Norris was speaking, and went into the Supreme Court, where I heard for an hour and a half the argument of Daniel Webster against the infidel provision in Stephen Girard’s Will.

Fahrenheit at Sunrise 14—  I attended public worship this morning at the Representative Hall where the chaplain of the house performed divine service with so much brevity that it seemed as if he thought his great official duty was to try in how little time he could turn it off. The whole job took him not more than three quarters of an hour. The text of his discourse was from Philippians 1.28. “And in nothing terrified by your adversaries; which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation and that of God.”— The latter part of the verse— He spoke without notes—said nothing which could fix itself upon the memory—nothing but dull commonplace devotion, without even that fervour which betokens the sincere conviction of Mr Tustin of the truth of his own doctrines.— He defined not very accurately the meaning of the word token, but did not clearly specify those whose perdition was evidently betokened.— Nor what the token was. This man’s election as Chaplain to the house is a problem— So is the facts that last week a subscription paper was circulated round the Hall for printing his Sermon upon Faith, delivered the Sunday before last.— The auditory this day was very small— I walked home, and after dinner attended at St. John’s Church, where Mr Hawley read the evening service for Sexagesima Sunday and the Bishop of Vermont Hopkins preached from Hebrews 2–15 “And deliver them who through fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage.” What a contrast to the Sermon of the Chaplain— The Bishop’s discourse was on the fear of death inherent in the nature of man—on his subjection to bondage throughout life by that fear; and on redemption from that bondage by sincere faith in Christ the redeemer— A close compact argument, all flowing from and returning to the text. Death—bondage—redemption—what intense feeling! what absorbing interest—what searching pathos—are interwoven with the solemn discussion of these topics! The bishop seized upon them, and familiarly handled them all—in composition of refined and elegant simplicity—in a tone of delivery kind, affectionate and deeply impressive— It is long since I have heard an appeal so eloquent to my own conscience, and when the enquiry came to every hearer, whether he could safely and confidently rely upon his own right to the blessing of that redemption from that bondage of the fear of death, my conscience smote me, and the involuntary tear stole down my cheek— I had never before to my remembrance heard the name of bishop Hopkins— I shall remember him as long as any trace of Memory remains upon my brain— David Lee Child this morning came in from New-York, and spent three hours of this Evening with me— Will the Speaker exclude him from the Hall?

My wife’s birth day. 69—  The winter is relaxing and I trust, I shall suffer no more this season of disqualification for writing, by the severity of the cold— This has not been unusually great here; but the harbours of New-York and Boston have been frozen over, and the navigation of Long-Island Sound for some time interrupted.— At the house this day, Duncan L. Clinch appeared and was sworn as one of the Representatives from the State of Georgia— Julius Rockwell, and Osmyn Baker have recently taken their Seats from the seventh and sixth Congressional Districts of Massachusetts; and Moses Abbott is daily expected having at last been elected from the third district—thereby completing the representation of Massachusetts in the present Congress— In the house this day the report of the Committee of Elections on the right of the spurious general ticket members, was resumed— Richard French of Kentucky gave an hour of his most elaborate nonsense to prove that the districting Section of the Apportionment act of 1842. was not law, because Blackstone defines Law to be a rule of conduct, and a rule of action— Then followed Samuel F. Vinton of Ohio with a sound, logical and conclusive argument in support of the districting section in which he pointed out some of the absurdities of Douglass’s report which Douglass by frequent interruptions vainly attempted to defend. Edward J. Black of Georgia then assumed that the objection to the general ticket elexctions was a proposition to expel 21 members from their seats and to disfranchise the four States which sent them. And then he raved his hour about the horrible injustice and atrocious tyranny of expelling 21 members and disfranchising four Sovereign States, when the members have committed no offence and are not even charged with any crime— This shuffling trick of misstating the Question, and setting up a man of straw to make a pompous demonstration of knocking him down, is a measure of the capacity of Edward Black, and of the majority of this house—for his vapid absurdities passed for argument as cogent as if it had pointed directly at the question before the house— David W. Dickinson of Tennessee came next and bore down more upon his Colleagues A. V. Brown and Cave Johnson, for voting themselves for the apportionment act with this Section which they now pronounce unconstitutional in it, than upon the merits of the question— John A. M’Clernand of Illinois talked off his time and George Rathbun closed for the day with a fiery blast against the law, till the adjournment about six O’Clock— In the evening visits from Mr Garrett Davis, with a friend of his named Hanson; from Mr Stevens a shipbuilding projector, and from Professor Wines.

I called at the Patriotic Bank, and deposited 22 dollars and 77 cents received fromMoody for his note payable 60 days from the 11th. of December the day of the sale of Mr T. B. Johnson’s effects— Of the six notes that I left there last Sunday payable in 60 days, four have been paid, and two protested. I left them however at the bank, supposing that promissors or endorsers may call and pay them in a few days— At the house, another long and tedious day was consumed in discussing the questions upon the general ticket elections. The debate of the morning was commenced by Hugh A. Haralson of Georgia, and continued by James B. Bowlin of Missouri— These are both among the most moderate of the furious faction, now ruling in the Congress— I heard Haralson through; but there was nothing to remember on his speech—and when Bowlin began with his, I began then to grow drowsy, and to escape an hour or two of soporifics left the Hall and went into that where the Supreme Court were in Session to see what had become of Stephen Girard’s Will and the scramble of lawyers and collaterals for the fragments of his colossal and misshapen endowment of an infidel charity school for orphan boys.— Webster had just before closed his argument for which it is said, if he succeeds he is to have fifty thousand dollars for his share of the plunder.— The court room was nearly deserted, and Governor Moorhead the Senator from Kentucky with his Colleague Crittenden sitting at his side was discoursing to the Court and the Walls, upon some Kentucky land case I remained but a short time there and went thence into the Senate chamber, where Jabez W. Huntington Senator from Connecticut, answering with pith and moment Levi Woodbury’s New-Hampshire endorsement of George M’Duffie’s South-Carolina Anti-Tariff bill— When he finished M’Duffie, who has already drag’d like a wounded snake his slow length along through two enormous speeches on his forty bale bill, still claimed the last word; and to humour him the question on his bill was postponed. I went into the Library room of the Court, where I met Franklin Dexter and to refresh my memory looked over the case of Millar and Taylor in the 4th. Volume of Burrows’s Reports, for the equal division of the 12 judges of England upon the question of literary property— Returning to the house I heard I had lost a handsome hour argument of Garrett Davis of Kentucky, and William H. Stiles of Georgia was working on coarse cloth a tawdry embroidery of flowers— Dromgoole, Barringer and D. D. Barnard followed, till 8 O’Clock in the Evening when the house adjourned. "

                "text": "14. V. Wednesday.  The sitting of the house protracted last Evening till 8 O’Clock, left me no time for writing after my dinner, and the necessity of drawing my report on the resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts to a close absorbed the hours of this morning so that my diary fell into arrear, excessively difficult to retrieve— The man whose surname I forget, came with a volume of Historical collections for which I had subscribed— The Revd. Mr Knox came to ask the perusal of a Lecture, which he said he heard I had delivered upon Faith— I was uncertain whether I had a copy of it here, but promised if I had that I would send it to him— I mentioned to him the Sermon of Mr Tinsley upon Faith and how much I had been struck with his text— On my way to the Capitol, I stop’d at R. W. Dyer’s Auction Office, and told him that two of the Notes taken by him, at the sale of Mr T. B. Johnson’s effects were protested for nonpayment at the Patriotic Bank— He said he would look to it. At the house Stephen A Douglass of Illinois, the author of the majority Report from the Committee of Elections, had taken the floor last Evening, and now raved out his hour in abusive invectives upon the members who had pointed out its blunders, and upon the whig party. His face was convulsed—his gesticulation frantic; and he lashed himself into such a heat, that if his body had been made of combustible matter it would have burnt out. In the midst of his roaring to save himself from choaking he strip’d off and cast away his cravat, unbuttoned his waistcoat and had the air and aspect of a half naked pugilist—and this man comes from a judicial bench, and passes for an eloquent Orator.— When the Speakers hammer pounded him off there was a scramble of two or three dozen candidates for the floor, but the Speaker knew where to fix his eye and gave it to the ruffian John B. Weller who after the mockery of an eulogy upon the unexampled ability displayed in this discussion said it had been sufficiently debated and moved the previous question— It was carried, and the question was first put on a trap resolution for the whigs that all the members elected from the districted States, were entitled to their Seats. The vote was 128 to 2.—the whigs refusing to vote Then followed the names of every member from the 4 general ticket States, all declared duly elected: and the yeas and nays were taken upon each member separately in the delegations of New-Hampshire and Georgia till about 8. O’Clock when the adjournment was carried. "

At ten this morning I had been employing the previous hours of the day in finishing my Report on the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts— It has been excessively hurried and is consequently feeble and indigested I attended the meeting of the Committee in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures all the members were present and punctual except Mr Davis who had forgotten that this was the day to which the Committee had adjourned— I read my Report, which occupied two hours. Immediately after I finished, Burt, moved to take the question upon Gilmer’s motion offered at the first meeting of the Committee— That the Amendment of the Constitution proposed by the Legislature of Massachusetts ought not to be recommended— I objected to taking this final question until the discussion on the Resolves and Petitions referred to the Committee, should be completed and especially till Mr Gilmer’s report should be read— He then moved that the Chairman should be directed to ask leave of the house to sit during the Sessions of the house to which I objected, and Mr Sample moved to adjourn till to-morrow morning at ten O’Clock which was carried— Gilmer, Burke and Burt voting against it— The house had been nearly half an hour in Session, when I reached my Seat. Moses Abbott had appeared and been sworn, as member from the third Congressional district of Massachusetts.— The yeas and nays were being called on the right of all the general ticket members from the State of Mississippi for they now took them all in a lump. Sample asked that the members from the Committee on the Massachusetts Resolves, who had been on service in Committee when the call of yeas and nays commenced might be allowed to vote.— but objection was made and they were not permitted— I lost my vote therefore on that question. But I gave it on the repetition of the same question regarding the members from the State of Missouri—carried 106 to 63—by which the outrage on the Constitution and Law was consummated.— Dromgoole then attempted to introduce a Resolution that the general ticket elections in the four refractory States were valid notwithstanding the second Section of the apportionment act.— He failed for want of a two thirds vote— So did A. V. Brown in an attempt to force the repeal of the districting Section— Adjourned soon after 3. "

I moved to insert on the minutes that the question was taken to accommodate a member about to cease to be of the Committee— But all the members of the Committee except Giddings voted against this— Gilmer sneeringly thanked me for my kindness— I answered him that he might economize his thanks, that I had too much experience of the character of his kindness to have any such to offer him in return. I moved the resolution at the close of my report, to postpone the further consideration of the Resolves to the first Monday of next December.— This was rejected on the final vote— Gilmer Burke, Burt, Davis, Ingersoll and Sample voted for Gilmer’s Resolution— Giddings and I voted against it; and Morse asked to be and was excused from voting. It was then agreed that Gilmer should make his report also signed by Burt to the house— That when Ingersoll and Burke should be ready another meeting of the Committee should be called when their reports should be read and with mine, and the journal be reported to the house—and the Committee adjourned— In the house John P. Kennedy, just elected from Baltimore took his seat.— Gilmer presented his report, and resigned his Seat— The house resumed the morning hour occupation of debating the report of the Committee on the rules— Luther Severance of Maine made an excellent hour speech against retaining the gag.— and John Campbell of South Carolina took the floor for to-morrow— Private business followed.

I received last evening a Report, by my Son as Chairman of a joint Committee of the Legislature of Massachusetts, with two Resolves, concerning the annexation of Texas to the United States. It is to be seen, and of deep importance, what the action of that Legislature will be upon them.— I distrust— This morning, Mr M’Clintock Young—chief Clerk of the Treasury Department with a bundle of papers prepared to be reported to the House in answer to a Resolution offered by me of enquiry into the condition of the Smithsonian fund.— I looked over some of the papers and found they contained a part of the information that I wanted— He said the report would be sent in this day—but he afterwards wrote me a note advising me, that the Secretary had gone to visit the Princeton a new Steamer just arrived and that the Report would be sent in on Monday— Mrs Mather is a Lady residing at Brooklyn, Long Island, inventress of a Submarine Telescope, an instrument for seeing objects deep under water; such as the bottoms of ships, or wrecks sunk to the bottom on soundings— She wishes that Congress would purchase her invention, and has a memorial to that effect before the Committee of Naval Affairs— I promised to converse with Mr Parmenter now chairman of that Committee on the subject. As I entered the house a man by the name of Skinner stop’d me with a Letter of introduction from Mr Ephraim Foster and requested my favour to a private land claim of his before the house— I had already a Letter from his adverse party stating the merits of his claim— The Report on the Rules consumed the morning hour.— John Campbell of South-Carolina consumed it by a speech worthy of Caesar Borgia— When the drop came upon it, the Speaker among a half score of competitors gave the floor to Armistead Burt— The House went into Committee of the whole, on private Bills. Joseph R. Ingersoll in the Chair— Several bills were debated and among them that in which Mr Skinner was concerned; but I had not time to examine the merits of the case or to take part in the discussion— I called at the Supreme Court room which except the judges was all but empty. At the Senate chamber altogether empty— In the Law Library for a volume of Pennsylvania Laws which was not there. At the Congress Library where I found the first volume of the fourth series of American Archives p. 1524. and the Annual Register for 1775— The house adjourned at 4— There was a duel yesterday between two young men—Julian May andCochrane who was shot through the head.

I attended the morning public worship in the Hall of the House of Representatives, where the prayers and the singing were performed by the Chaplain of the Senate Mr Tustin, and the Sermon was delivered by Mr Musgrave, a presbyterian clergyman from Baltimore— His text was 1. Corinthians 16.22. “If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ; let him be Anathema Maranatha.” This with the preacher’s exposition might be termed a cool hundred of eternal damnation— He first notice the peculiar position of this malediction at the close of the epistle—between the salutation of the Apostle with his own hand, and the benediction upon those to whom the Letter was addressed— He said it was Paul’s custom to employ an amanuensis to write his apostles, and then to address them in a salutation and benediction with his own hand, and that it was in this manner that this curse had been so emphatically denounced— He then explained the meaning of the words— Anathema was a greek word meaning to separate, set apart, or devote. Maranatha was Hebrew, meaning the Lord cometh, or, May the Lord come— He said there were in the Hebrew ritual three degrees of devoting to a curse of which Maranatha was the third, and signified total destruction.— Then he noticed the comprehensive universality of the curse— If “any man” and so forth, and then he defined the Love of Christ—to love him was to obey his commandments, by their fruits ye shall know them.— And every man professing to be a Christian must understand that this condemnation if he incurs it is eternal, and that it will be perfectly just— In credulous Odi— It cannot be so. But it may perhaps not be amiss to be told so. A commination which has even a colour of authority from Scripture, deserves to be seriously listened to, and deliberately considered— Its tendency is to purity and righteousness— Take the warning and be safe— Mr Musgrave came to my seat with Mr Tustin, who introduced him to me— Mr Tinsley was also there; and the house was well filled— After dinner I attended at St. John’s Church. Mr Hawley read the Evening prayer for Quinquagesima Sunday and preached from Acts 10.43. “To him give all the prophets witness”— Mrs Madison and Richard Cutts here this Evening. "

Palfrey, now the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, concerning a demand of certain documents relating to land-grants, from the British Colonial Government of New-Brunswick— This demand has been repeatedly renewed, through the Department of State and the British Minister here Mr Fox—without obtaining the documents or as yet an answer from the Government of New-Brunswick— Mr Upshur said he would repeat the application, and the New Minister from Great-Britain Sir Richard Pakenham having arrived in this Country, and being announced as having been yesterday at Baltimore, would probably be here in a day or two, and might bring some decision upon the subject from the Government in England— I stated to Mr Upshur the gross error detected in the printed census of 1840. principally, in the return of 133 insane and idiot coloured people, in the town of Worcester Massachusetts; and wished to know whether the error was in printing the census or was on the original return— They were examined and the error was found there— I went into the Library, and there found at last an Edition of the Laws of Pennsylvania containing the act incorporating the first abolition Society; and Mr Greenhow promised me a copy of it— At the house this was the day for the call of the States for Petitions; and I had scarcely taken my Seat, when the Speaker called out Petitions are in order from the State of Massachusetts. I had forgotten that the call would thus commence, and presented ten or a dozen which I had not yet entered upon my list— Edmund Burke presented a petition from 22 members of the Legislature of Rhode-Island, praying for an investigation of the conduct of President Tyler in the Dorrite insurrection, and into the right of the present members to hold their seats. He moved its reference to a select Committee of five, and at the suggestion of Weller, that it be printed—both which after much agitation, and several takings of yeas and nays were both carried— The abolition and anti-slavery petitions were generally treated very contemptuously by the house. The call went entirely through the States and Territories.— The report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the present condition of the Smithsonian fund was sent in of which Mr Young apprized me by a private note. I moved its reference to a select Committee of 9. and that with the Documents it should be printed. Burke moved its reference to the joint Committee on the Library. To this I objected and assigned my reasons, whereupon Burke unexpectedly to me withdrew his motion; and mine was carried. Adjourned over till Wednesday— I walked home— Beautiful weather. "

The house of Representatives, yesterday adjourned over till to-morrow, on the motion of Isaac E Holmes, member from South-Carolina, for the avowed purpose of enabling the members to visit the Princeton a War Steamer and sailing vessel combined, with the Steam machinery of Ericsen’s propellers, all within the Hull of the vessel, and below the water line, and carrying 24. 42 pound Carronades, and on her main deck two enormous wrought iron cannon, with barrels of 14 inches diameter, chargeable with 40 pounds of powder, and discharging a ball of 225 pounds weight— This vessel a gimcrack of sundry other inventions of Captain Stockton himself, was built under his directions, and is commanded by him— She was ordered round here to be exhibited to the President and heads of the Executive Departments, and to the members of both houses of Congress, to fire their souls with patriotic ardor for a naval war. On Saturday last by invitation from Captain Stockton the vessel was visited by the President; the heads of Departments and Senators, and for this day at 11. O’Clock, Captain Stockton had issued a card of invitation to every member of the house of representatives besides a general one in the National Intelligencer of this morning.— Holmes’s motion to adjourn over the day, was carried by evading the call for the yeas and nays, and even the call for tellers.— This morning, after a call at the Bank of the Metropolis to deposite a check for 600 dollars, which I received from the Speaker yesterday, and to draw 100 dollars for the daily household expenses; and a call at the Orphan’s Court with Mary, my son John’s widow’s account against the Estate of T. B. Johnson for 3 quarter’s rent of her house which I left for the judge to pass upon. I went with Isaac Hull Adams, to Greenleaf’s point, and thence embarked in the Princeton’s barge on board of that vessel— I was punctual to the hour of 11. and the first of the company that came. Captain Stockton received me with great politeness, and shewed me all the machinery of the ship. Afterwards upwards of 100 members of the house came on board. The two great guns are called the Peacemaker and the Orator, a salute was fired from the Carronade’s, and the Peacemaker was three times discharged. The vessel was steamed down 12 miles to Fort Washington and back to her moorings opposite Greenleaf’s point. A plentiful cold collation was served— We reached home at 4. P.M. "

Mr Frye was here last Evening, and had some conversation with me concerning the Columbian Mills, which have at last become a dead burden upon my Estate— He considers himself and me fortunate that two persons have been found, who for living rent free in the two houses have undertaken to preserve the mills from perishing by the decays of doing nothing.— This morning Mr Lewis Johnson was here, and I returned to him, the affidavit of Nathaniel Johnson’s widow at N. Orleans, authenticated by the Governor of Louisiana, which at his request I had forwarded to Norton Quincy Thaxter at Hingham and which he has sent back— I told Mr Johnson, what Mr and Mrs Thaxter had written to me, respecting Nathaniel Otis’s widow and her children; and also what Mr M’Culloch the comptroller had said to me, when I conversed with him the other day about the remnant of William Otis’s claim on the Treasury.— On my way to the house I stop’d at the Patriotic Bank, and deposited there in my name for Mrs Mary C. Adams, a check for 300 dollars which as Executor of T. B. Johnson I had given her in payment of her account for rent of her house; and I drew by check 100 dollars of the money and paid it to her. At the house John P. Kennedy of Baltimore introduced John Wethered, his colleague as member from the third Congressional District of Maryland.— By the general consent of the house I moved that the use of the Hall should be granted for next Tuesday evening to the American Bible Society, which was adopted without opposition— There were Resolutions of the Legislature of the State of Indiana for the occupation of the Oregon Territory, referred last Monday to the Committee of foreign Affairs— The Committee had already reported against the measure; and their report was before the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Charles J. Ingersoll, chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs had suffered the reference to be made; then moved a reconsideration of the vote, but said he would not press it then— This day he was not in his seat—and so his motion for reconsideration was postponed till tomorrow. Next came the report of the Committee on the rules— Armistead Burt of South-Carolina, made a furious hour speech against the abolitionists, and grossly insulted Beardsley; and defied him— When he closed Dellet of Alabama took the floor for to-morrow— The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Campbell in the Chair; passed the Indian appropriation bill—entered upon the annual pension bill—rose after four O’Clock, and the house adjourned.

                "text": "22. VI.15 Thursday.  Washington’s birthday—  As I was returning from the house yesterday a man by the name of Pennington stopped me in the avenue and intreated me to attend at half past 7 in the evening a lecture which he would deliver on a system of aerostation or of aerial steam navigation, of his invention— In rather weak compliance with his urgency I took his ticket and went and heard his lecture by which it was apparent that the man was a monomaniac— He had a very complicated machine, with a printed pamphlet, and engraving of his machine, second edition, which in a very confused manner he attempted to explain— There were only five or six persons present, and his lecture of half an hour consisted chiefly of complaints that he had been charged with insanity and of arguments to shew that he was of perfect sound mind— I had lost my time; but I could reflect and compassionate the frailty of human nature— This day at the house Mr Kennedy introduced John M. S. Causin member from the first and Francis Brengle from the second Congressional District of Maryland who were sworn and took their Seats— The member from thedistrict also afterwards came in— James Dellet of Alabama a whig Slave monger made an hour speech for the gag and against Giddings and me, full of frothy eloquence and invective— The Slavers have become bolder with the arrival of the Maryland delegation, and having now ascertained that they will carry the restoration of the gag the three successive Speeches of Campbell, Burt and Dellet have exhibited a regular ascending graduation of overbearing insolence and bullying. To leave it all without reply, would be tame submission. To reply in the same tone might breed a brawl, for which I should be held responsible by the public.— To say just what will be proper and nothing more requires counsel from above— May it not be withheld— When Dellet’s hour closed Charles Rogers of New-York obtained the floor for to-morrow. There is a bill to repeal the distribution Law introduced by Payne of Alabama— Dromgoole moved its reference to the Committee of Ways and Means which was carried— Henley of Indiana moved a suspension of the rules, to offer a Resolution, joint, for closing the Session in May— The vote was announced 108 to 54. Exactly two thirds; but the Speaker voted in the negative and declared the rules were not suspended— The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Campbell in the chair, and took up the pension appropriation bill which was debated, and finally reported to the house—previous question, and adjourned— I had gone into the Senate Chamber—heard an excellent Speech of Choate on the Oregon question, and had some conversation with Huntington and Crittenden.

Mr Fendall who is the District Attorney of this District for the United States, and is also Counsel of Mr Lewis Johnson as Administrator on the Estate of William Otis called on me this morning to confer with me on the remnant of claim for interest until the time of payment— At the last settlement President Van Buren insisted that Mr Johnson should give a receipt in full and renounce all further claim, which he did against his will; but with the advice of his then Counsel Francis S. Key since deceased.— He now considers it however as extorted from him by duress, and such engagements never are of any avail against well-founded claims— I mentioned to Mr Fendall my interview with the Comptroller M’Culloch and his offer to refer the question of further interest to the present Attorney General John Nelson— I spoke also of the questions concerning the legitimacy of some of Nathaniel Otis’s children—but Mr Johnson had not consulted him with regard to them— I answered this morning a Letter from my Son, and see by the Boston Courier of Wednesday morning that the Resolves reported by him against the annexation of Texas passed on Tuesday, in the Senate of Massachusetts, unanimously with one exception upon the first Resolve 34 Senators present. Six absent among whom was Levi Lincoln— My Son’s speech is in the Courier, and shews that he is aware of his position.—which he has deliberately assumed, explicitly declared, and will firmly maintain— My heart aches at the prospect of the dangers and trials that await and already beset him— May the God of Justice be his guide and guard—and the God of Mercy protect him— At the house there was a snarl of an hour upon a mistake of the clerk in recording the name of Mr Slidell yesterday in the negative on Henley’s motion to suspend the rules for a resolution to adjourn in May— Slidell had voted in the affirmative— Slidell was allowed to rectify the record of his vote— But this error was the cause of another— The suspension of the rules was actually carried and the Speaker on the strength of former precedents decided that Henley might offer his resolution now.— Dromgoole appealed from his decision and the gang were about to bully him out of it when Henley withdrew his motion, and said he would offer it again next Tuesday. The report on the rules was then taken up—and Charles Rogers of New-York made an hour speech against the gag.— Dromgoole took the floor and withdrew his motion to recommit the report, and offered an amendment to the whole report, including the gag rule; which he moved to have printed—but the hour was out and the house went into Committee of the whole on private Bills, Joseph R. Ingersoll in the Chair— I went into the Senate Chamber and heard William L. Dayton on the Oregon question— "

Mr Frye called in the evening, and we settled the accounts between him and the estate of Thomas B. Johnson, by my giving him a check on the patriotic Bank for 46 dollars 39 cents, for sundry small charges paid by him before I arrived, after the death of Mr Johnson, and by his giving me a check on the same bank for 37 dollars and 37 cents, in payment of his note for articles purchased by him at the auction sale of 11. December. This morning I returned the visit of Mr Pakenham, the new Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary from Great-Britain; who brought me a Letter of introduction from Edward Everett— He has a Secretary with him; a young man, by the name of Bidwell— At the house the day was consumed in debate on the report on the rules. Dromgoole, who had the floor, withdrew his motion to recommit the report, whereby E. J. Black’s instructions fell of course, and now Dromgoole moves an amendment, to strike out the whole Report after the 13th. rule and insert another set of his own selection, with revival of all the rules of despotic majorities—and he moved to postpone the further consideration of the subject till next Tuesday, and that his proposed amendment should be printed— Dromgoole’s object now is to conjure up debate upon many other points and mingle them with the gag-question, and entangle them all together so as to evade the direct question upon the gag—alone of the issue of which so taken, he is afraid— Numbers of the Northern Democracy, afraid of their constituents if they vote for the gag, and afraid of losing the vote of the South for Van Buren if they vote against it suffer Dromgoole to lead them by the nose to relieve them from voting directly upon that question at Cave Johnson moved as an amendment to his amendment to strike it all out, and substitute the rule, that all abolition petitions shall be received and laid on the table without any other action of the house upon them— Then came a debate upon that, and Steenrod moved to lay the whole subject on the table—rejected by yeas and nays 82 to 112. I enquired what had become of Wise’s minority report and called upon Chapman who had signed it—whereupon Dromgoole broke out again with the pretension that there is no right to make minority reports. Hamlin moved the previous question but withdrew it at Chapmans request he promising to renew it— He then came out with a dogged attack of a quarter of an hour upon me, and closed with the previous question. I asked five minutes to reply, but was refused— Adjourned before 4. "

The further consideration of the report on the rules was postponed yesterday till next Tuesday and Dromgoole’s amendment was ordered to be printed— I received visits last evening from the Revd. Dr Cox of Brooklyn Long-Island, the Revd. Dr Smith and another clergyman from New-York with Mr Knox the pastor of the second presbyterian church— The others are here to attend the meetings of the Washington Bible Society next Monday and of the American Bible Society, in the Hall of the house of Representatives next Tuesday evening.— This morning I attended public worship at the Hall. Notice had been given in the National Intelligencer of yesterday morning, that Mr Tinsley would preach, by request upon a particular subject—which had somewhat excited my curiosity— But his text was Hebrews, 4.14. [“]Seeing that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus, the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. 15. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched, with the feeling of our infirmities.” The most hacknied, and most unedifying of all the calvinistic doctrines—the atonement. After dinner, being a little belated at the second Presbyterian Church, I found Dr Cox of Brooklyn, reading the 5th. Chapter of 2. Corinthians and commenting as he went along. Afterwards he took for his text the last four verses of the same chapter 18. “And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 19. To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation 20. Now when we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God. 21. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” The atonement again—but here rolled up in all the metaphysical subtleties of Saint Paul. Dr Cox is a perfect master of them, and deals them out with unsparing hand. Dr Cox has an answer at hand for every objection to the doctrine of atonement; but the misfortune is that he often states the objection stronger than the answer— In the evening with my wife and our granddaughter Mary-Louisa, I attended at Trinity Church, where Mr Stringfellow was reading prayers for the first Sunday in lent, after which the Revd. Stephen H. Tyng, a son of my old friend Dudley Atkins Tyng, preached from Luke 2.34— [“]Behold this child is set, for the fall, and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against— 35. that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed”—a discourse of some originality—and not ineloquent— The house was crowded. Miss Cutts was here at tea. "

Monday  I despatched a Letter to Levi Fahnestock, and sundry others a committee of the banner Clay club at Baltimore in answer to one from them with an elegant walking stick from Ashland which I declined accepting, and promised an answer to their Letter which from mere embarrassment what to say I have procrastinated till J. P. Kennedy has twice hinted to me their impatience to receive it— At the house it was the regular bi-weekly day for the call for Resolutions, before which sundry Executive communications were laid before the house— One of them a message from the President saying that he had appoved the bill authorizing the transfer of naval appropriations from one head of expenditure to another; but that it was of no avail—he recommends further legislation upon the subject; and also for the construction of several ships of war like the Princeton, but of a larger class— More naval appropriations. Referred to the Committee of Naval affairs, of which Parmenter is chairman since Wise’s resignation— I spoke to him about this message—but he told me that Committee would not propose any increase of the Navy Appropriations— Bidlack moved a suspension of the rules to take the question upon a resolution of enquiry moved by him heretofore about coal and iron— I said I was perfectly willing to vote now, and in favour of his resolution, if the house would extend the favour to other Resolutions in the same condition— Bidlack withdrew his motion— Among the Resolutions offered was one by Burke of enquiry of the Postmaster General, about Isaac Hill’s contracts to furnish Blanks paper and twine to that Department. Adopted.— I offered a call upon the Secretary of State whether any gross errors have been discovered in the official returns of the Census of 1840 printed under the direction of the State Department— I expected objection to this call; but there was none— It was adopted as were many others among them two of three anti-abolition abstractions moved first by Holmes and then by Campbell of South Carolina, which occasioned much confusion, but were carried by almost unanimous votes—adjourned about 5. O’Clock— In the Evening I attended at the Presbyterian Meeting house at 4 1/2 street a Meeting of the Washington Bible Society, at which Matthew St. Clair Clarke presided— Resolutions were offered and addresses delivered by Septimus Tustin the Chaplain of the Senate—by John M’Pherson Berrien, and by Charles Hudson, the member of the House— Berrien is now a Senator from Georgia.

Mr Brigham the Secretary of the American Bible Society called on me this morning, and we agreed on the simple arrangements for holding the meeting in the hall of the house of Representatives this Evening— Mr James Gore King of New-York paid me also a morning visit.— My morning hours were absorbed in concluding the written address with which I was to take the chair of the meeting— At the house John P. Kennedy introduced Thomas A. Spence, member from the 6th. congressional district of Maryland, who was sworn and by taking his seat completed the delegation from that State in the house— After some of the usual casual preliminaries, the report on the rules, with Dromgoole’s amendment and Cave Johnson’s amendment to that were resumed— Johnson made an hour speech, in support of his amendment which was to substitute instead of the gag-rule, another in these words—“that the rules of the last Session of Congress be, and are hereby adopted for the government of the 28th. Congress except the 25th. Rule, which shall read as follows: That all memorials, petitions, or other papers relating to Slavery, or the Slave trade between the States and Territories, or in any way connected with it, shall be received by the house, and laid upon the table without debate”— His argument was that the gag rule, refusing to receive petitions, could not be sustained— That it was lost by Southern whig votes, and he read over the names of all the Southern members who voted for rescinding the rule. Then commenced the chicaery of moving for the previous question, and reconsideration, and laying on the table; and to divide the question, and every species of subterfuge— Cave’s amendment was finally rejected by yeas and nays 35 to 143. The question next came upon Dromgoole’s amendment to strike out the whole report of the Committee after the 12th. rule and insert another whole body of rules proposed by him; Schenk moved to divide the question so as first to take it on the whole amendment of Dromgoole, except the gag rule, and one other and then separately on each of them. In this way a direct question was taken on the gag-rule which was rejected by a vote of 86 to 106. a majority of 20 against the rule— But it was in vain. Barringer of North Carolina moved a Reconsideration of the vote adopting Dromgoole’s amendment to the report with two exceptions—and the house adjourned. At 7 in the Evening the Meeting of the American Bible Society was held in the hall of the house, at which 3 presided, assisted by judge M’Lean of Ohio, andDunlop of Maine as Vice Presidents— I addressed the meeting— So did Revd Doctor Tyng of Philadelphia and Dr Cox of Brooklyn. The meeting adjourned after 10. O’Clock. "

Stockton who came to spend a few days with us— Isaac Hull Adams had a separate invitation, and went to the ill fated party— I had engaged also to dine at 6. O’Clock this evening with Mr Grinnell and Mr Winthrop in company with Mr Pakenham the new British Minister— At the house, the report on the rules was resumed.— Barringer’s motion for the reconsideration of the vote on Dromgoole’s rules of 40 and 41. was rejected by yeas and nays 55 to 115.— The question then recurred on the adoption of the report as amended by the several votes on Dromgoole’s substitute. R. D. Davis said if this should be rejected the house would be without rules—whereupon Chapman moved to lay the whole subject on the table— The vote on this motion as taken by yeas and nays was 85 to 90. but after the whole roll had been called and all the answers given the Slavers plied their northern democratic allies with personal menace and intreaty, till three of them changed their votes from no to aye and the motion to lay the whole subject on the table was carried 88 to 87— One of the three Jacob S. Yost of Pennsylvania changed his vote after enquiring of the Speaker if the vote should now be to lay on the table the subject might be resumed, without a vote of two thirds, and receiving his answer, that the rules of the house were always under the controul of a majority, by giving one day’s notice— An equivocation— Reding of New-Hampshire moved a reconsideration of the vote to lay the whole subject on the table— Weller moved to lay the motion for reconsideration on the table which was carried.— A call of the house was moved and rejected— Adjourned at half past 3. I went into the chamber of the Committee of manufactures and wrote there till six. Dined with Mr Grinnell and Mr Winthrop. Mr Pakenham and his Secretary Mr Bidwell were there While we were at dinner John Barney burst into the chamber; rushed up to general Scott and told him with groans that the President wished to see him— That the great gun on board the Princeton, the Peacemaker had burst and killed the Secretary of State Upshur, the Secretary of the Navy T. W. Gilmer, Captain Beverley Kennon, Virgil Maxcy, a Coll. Gardiner of New-York and a coloured servant of the President, and desperately wounded several of the crew— General Scott soon left the table— Mr Webster shortly after—also the Senator Bayard— I came home before 10. in the Evening.

Benton the Senator from Missouri were stunned by the wind of the commotion and unsettled in mind by the commotion.— The Sensations of my bosom on the occurrence of this catastrophe of yesterday are so profound, so complicated so mingled up of unassociable elements that I dare not indulge them— This morning Mr Miller Secretary of the Washington Bible Society, came with three copies of the report of the proceedings of the American Bible Society for me to sign, as the presiding officer at the meeting— And he requested me to go with him to the Office of the National Intelligencer to obtain the insertion of these proceedings in that paper— He said that Mr Brigham the Secretary of the Society had been twice yesterday to the Office, without succeeding to see either of the Editors, Gales or Seaton; and had been obliged to leave the City yesterday afternoon— I accordingly went with Mr Miller to the Office. Neither Gales nor Seaton was there; but I gave the minutes of the meeting signed by me, to the foreman with a request that they might be published in the paper, which he promised that they should be. At the house immediately after the reading of the journal, a message was received from the President, announcing the lamentable catastrophe of yesterday, bewailing the loss of his two Secretaries with others, and hoping that Congress will not be discouraged by this accident from going on to build more and larger war Steamers than the Princeton.— George W. Hopkins moved the usual sympathising resolutions, adapted to the occasion, and the house adjourned over to Monday.— Hopkins, myself, Charles J. Ingersoll, D. D. Barnard and Cave Johnson, were appointed a Committee on the part of the house to join a like Committee of the Senate, of arrangements for the attendance of both houses in a body at the funeral of the two Secretaries. We went to the Senate chamber, where that body had just assembled and their Secretary Asbury Dickins was reading the journal of yesterday "

Yesterday, immediately after the reading of the journal of the Senate was completed John Tyler junr the President’s Son, delivered the same Message, which had been received and acted upon by the house—Whereupon William C. Rives a Senator from Virginia rose and after a very brief and appropriate notice of this awful dispensation of Providence, moved corresponding Resolutions to those which had been adopted by the house— They were passed by an unanimous vote and the Committee on the part of the Senate of arrangements for attendance at the funeral of the two Secretaries, appointed by the President pro Tempore of the Senate Willie P. Mangum, were William C. Rives, and William S. Archer, William R. King, Richard H. Bayard, and Levi Woodbury.—The two Committees went into the Vice President’s chamber—all present except Mr. Archer— After a discussion of perhaps an hour it was agreed to leave to the discretion of the two Chairmen to concert the arrangements, with those made under the direction of the President, and to give notice in the newspapers; to the members of the two houses, of the order of the procession.— I went into the chamber of the military Committee of the Senate, whereEdwards took two Daguerrotype likenesses of me, and I walked home, where I spent the remainder of the day— Evening visitors Mr Croghan with Mrs Jesup, and her daughter Jane.— Mr Francis new Senator from Rhode Island in the place of William Sprague, resigned, and E. R. Potter the member of the house, and I had a morning visit from Mr Grace now of Baltimore.  This morning I went to the Capitol; and at the Clerks Office procured copies of the yeas and nays on Tuesday upon the direct question of the gag-rule 85 to 106. and on Wednesday upon Chapman’s motion to lay the whole subject on the table first 85 to 90—and then by the change of 3 votes 88 to 87. The three votes were Duncan of Cincinnati John W. Davis of Indiana, and Jacob S. Yost of Pennsylvania who changed on a promise from the Speaker that the subject might be resumed by a vote of a mere majority—a promise which the Speaker will take care to break— I procured also copies of three recent documents of new regulations for the Navy and the Navy Department.—While at the house I heard of the death, of Henry Frick a member of the house from Pennsylvania— I met at the house several members, and among them, Mr Grinnell who walked home with me— I stop’d at Gadsby’s and left a card for Captain Stockton who was slightly hurt by the explosion. Evening visits from Mrs Thornton, Mrs Talbot and John Connell. "

I had met yesterday at the Capitol Mr Rives the Chairman of the Senate’s Committee of arrangements for the funeral, who told me that the members of the two houses were to assemble at their respective halls this morning at half past ten, and thence to proceed in a body to the Presidents house where the corpses were deposited, and where in the East-room the religious services were to be performed— I went accordingly to the house this morning— Isaac Hull Adams, and Walter Hellen were with me— A large portion of the members of both houses assembled and hack carriages were provided for them— I step’d into one of them with the Speaker John W. Jones, and Mr Hopkins and Mr Barnard my colleague members of the House Committee of Arrangements— But before we had got out of the Capitol Yard the Speaker discovered that the hack was crazy, and the horses restive, and he insisted on changing his carriage— We all alighted, my Carriage was close at hand in the procession— It was beginning to rain, and he took a seat with me— I could not make the same offer to the other two gentlemen but they were immediately supplied with a new carriage.— At the Presidents house the Speaker parted from me to resume his place at the head of the house; a special place having been assigned in the procession, immediately after the President and his cabinet to the Ex Presidents of the United States—of whom I was the only one present— There were four corpses in plain coffins—those of the three public officers, with the union flag stretched over them and Coll. Gardiner’s covered with a black pall. The East room was crowded with the President, his Cabinet; and sons and women of his family— The two houses of Congress foreign Ministers, the Mayors of Washington, Georgetown and Alexandria—municipal officers and of the Departments Army and Navy, and the relatives of the deceased— Mr Hawley read a part of the episcopal funeral service, Dr Laurie made a prayer and Mr Butler delivered a short discourse after which the long funeral blackened all the way from the East-room to the Congressional burying ground near the Eastern branch of the Potowmac. My young men left me and I went in the procession alone, in my carriage— At the common depository vault I heard the remainder of the Episcopal funeral service recited, and then came home alone— It was four in the afternoon, and I mused.

Winthrop—Richard Dana junr and Mr Thom— There was a notice in the National Intelligencer yesterday, that Mr Tustin the chaplain of the Senate would preach this morning, and turn to religious improvement the recent calamity. I attended at the Hall of the House of Representatives a few minutes belated during which a brief narrative of the melancholy occurrence had been read— They were singing when I reached the hall, which held a crowded auditory; among which there were certainly not twenty members of Congress— Mr Tustin’s text was from Revelation 20.11. [“]And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it—from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. 12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged, out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. 13. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it: and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.”— The throne of God—The Sea—Death—Hell—Books of Account and a book of life— Judgment for eternity according to their works—are the leading ideas of this magnificent but incongruous imagery.— The day of judgment—a theme always appropriate to the discourse of a christian teacher and perhaps peculiarly appropriate to a case of sudden, instantaneous unexpected violent death, in the midst of festivity and enjoyment, and falling at once of upon several person in the extremes of human society— Mr Tustin’s discourse was impressive and edifying, but hardly adequate to the occasion— The most remarkable thing in it was a statement that a watch in the pocket of one of the sufferers was found unbroken, with the hands on its face stop’d at 16 1/4 minutes past 4—indicating to a second the time of the explosion. Mr Tustin gave notice that his Colleague Mr Tinsley the Chaplain of the house would deliver an occasional discourse on this afflictive dispensation of Providence next Sunday.— After the service was over I called at Mrs Whitwells and saw Coll. Perkins, and Mr and Mrs Grinnell— I walked home and after dinner at St. John’s church hear the Revd Mr Frapley of Philadelphia read the Evening service for the second Sunday in lent, and preach from Amos 4.12—“Prepare to meet thy God”— A discourse of deep solemnity, and which it behooved me perhaps more than any other person present, to lay to heart— An awful admonition— May it not be wholly lost upon me. Mr D. D. Barnard was here this evening. "

She paid us a visit this morning in company with Mr Child. She is of mixed blood, Hispano-Mexican, almost white— Child told me she had desired him to say to me, that she intended this visit personally to me, for there were two objects in this country which she had desired to see—The falls of Niagara, and John Quincy Adams.— She speaks very little french, and is beginning to learn English. Mr Stockton conversed freely with her in Spanish— I called at the Department of State, and read to Mr John Nelson of Maryland the present Attorney General, and acting Secretary of State, the Letter from John G Palfrey Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which I had already read to the late Secretary Upshur, who had promised to communicate with the new Minister from England Mr Pakenham concerning it— At Mr Nelson’s request I left Mr Palfrey’s Letter with him and he promised to write a note this day to Mr Pakenham upon the subject— I mentioned also to him the Resolution of the house, moved by me, concerning the errors in the printed census, and told him that since that Resolution was adopted I had received a petition from the territory of Ioway complaining that there was in the printed census a return of Slaves there. I had examined the census and found there was in it such a return, and a like on in the territory of Wiskonsin— I wished the Report from the Department on the Resolution of the house should refer to these errors as well as to those stultifying the free coloured population— He asked me to write him a note pointing out these errors, and said he would cause an investigation to be made how they had originated.— At the house: immediately after the reading of the Journal, Joseph R. Ingersoll announced the decease of Henry Frick, late member from the 13th. district of Pennsylvania, who died last Friday morning, and whose remains were taken away the next day by his Son, to be buried at his home— Mr Ingersoll delivered a brief and very elegant obituary notice of his deceased colleague and moved the usual mortuary resolutions excepting those of attendance on the funeral and the house adjourned— After remaining two hours at the house I walked home and read Walker the Senator’s pamphlet urging the reannexation of Texas to the United States— Mr Frye was here this Evening— He has received an overture for the purchase of the Columbian Mills— I told him my terms, but without expectation of any successful conclusion.

At the house, immediately after the reading of the Journal, I moved to take up from the table Reding’s motion to reconsider the vote by which the whole subject of the Report on the Rules was laid on the table last Friday— The motion to reconsider was itself laid on the table, on the motion of Weller. Before Yost changed his vote from no to ay, which changed the decision and laid the whole subject on the table, he enquired whether the subject could be resumed without a vote of two thirds— The Speaker promised him that it could by giving one day’s notice— The rules of the house he said were thus always under the controul of a majority of the house— I then noticed in this Diary that the Speaker would take care to break this promise— I gave notice that I should move to dispense with the rule requiring a majority of two thirds to take up the report— The Speaker would not suffer my notice to be entered on the journal— And this morning when I moved to take up the motion for reconsideration which had been laid on the table last Friday, he said it could be done only by a vote of two thirds— I claimed that a motion for reconsideration being privileged could not lose its privilege by being laid on the table; he decided that it did— I said it was to be presumed the Speaker of the house was a man of his word—and reminded him of his promise to Yost— He said he had told Mr Yost that the rules of the house might be changed by giving notice, when it would be in order, of one day— I said he used these underscored words now, but had not used them then— He said he had used them then—which was not true— I asked when such notice would be in order. He said on the day for offering resolutions— But this is of no avail. The notice will be objected to, and lie over nominally for one day; but then cannot be taken up in its order, the time for which never will come.— The Committees were called for Reports— Elmer from the Committee of elections obtained leave for them to continue the employment of a Clerk till they got through the contested case of Jones and Botts— The Bill from the Senate for repairing the Pennsylvania Avenue was laid on the table by yeas and nays 118 to 64.— A message was received from the President, with the correspondence called for by the Resolution offered by Levi the Delegate from Florida, between the U.S. Marshal and the Government of New Providence, upon their refusal to deliver up certain fugitive negroes charged with murder.— Levi moved, its reference to the Committee of foreign Affairs with instructions which was carried and he made a rabid hour speech. His motion and instructions were carried by the previous question—no debate allowed— But the motion to print the motion to print the message was debatable and Giddings made a stinging speech. Pettit opposed the printing, and I answered him. The printing was ordered— Mr Child spent the evening with me. "

Wednesday  Miss Thompson is a young woman of South-Carolina much in want of money to enable her to go to her brother at Beaufort in that State— She came here yesterday to solicit charity of my wife, and repeated her visit this morning to me— I did not think her a very piteous claimant of alms, for she was apparently healthy, and somewhat ambitiously dressed, but she reminded me so much of her State that I gave her a five dollar bill.— At the house— A report by Joseph J. M’Dowell of Ohio, from the Committee of Accounts remodeling the system of the folding room, and the discipline and wages of the pages; which yesterday after some debate had been laid on the table, was reconsidered, debated again, and again laid on the table— Mr Parmenter from the Committee of Naval Affairs reported a bill making an appropriation recommended by a late message from the President; but he told me the report was against any additional War-Steamers. Dromgoole presented Resolutions of the Legislature of Virginia, counter to the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts on the Slave representation, and moved their reference to a select Committee of 9— Payne of Alabama then attempted to present Resolutions from the Legislature of that State. Winthrop objected to the reception of the Virginia Resolutions, unless those of the Massachusetts Legislature, which I had offered should also be received— Dromgoole said it was too late to object and moved the previous question, which was carried and the Virginia Resolutions were referred— I offered again the Massachusetts Resolves, but Duncan of Cincinnati had the floor for a speech on a bill introduced by him, for holding elections for members of Congress, and electors of President and Vice President— He spoke one hour on this bill, and then L. Q. C. Elmer, chairman of the Committee of Elections moved as an amendment to Duncan’s bill, another as a substitute for it upon which he said just enough to give Duncan, another hour to finish his speech— It was a glaring and preconcerted evasion of the hour rule—strong objection was made to his occupying the second hour, but Hopkins who occupied the chair as speaker decided the question in his favour— His speech was a bitter invective upon the whigs of bribery and corruption in the election of 1840. particularly in Hamilton County Ohio, where Pendleton carried the election for Congress against him. He would not vouch for it, but it was said that the election had cost Pendleton 20000 dollars. When he closed his second hour, Clingman of North-Carolina obtained the floor and moved to adjourn which was carried— Mr and Mrs Stockton dined abroad, and Miss Cutts dined with us— John C. Calhoun was this day nominated and confirmed as Secretary of State— "

Mr Wickliffe promised him an answer this evening I went with him thence to the Patent Office, and passed cursorily round the long hall, the museum of the National Institute— I was agreeably surprised at the elegant and tasteful scientific arrangement of all the objects of curiosity collected not only in Lieutenant Wilkes’s exploring expedition, but from a multitude of other sources; all which has been effected since the meetings of the Institute in that hall the Summer before last— Mr Hobart went with me to the Capitol, and I left him in the hall where the Supreme Court were in Session. At the house— Burke offered a call on the clerk to report why the documents of the second and third Sessions of the 27th. Congress have not been distributed— A joint resolution from the Committee on the library for an appropriation to purchase copies of Gordon’s digest of U.S. Laws—and a Resolution from the Select Committee on the Rhode-Island Memorial for leave to send for persons and papers.— Causin one of the new members from Maryland, is a member of that Committee and moved as a substitute for the permission to send for persons and papers, tha the committee be discharged from the further consideration of the subject.

                "text": "8. V:30. Friday—  I called this morning at the Patriotic Bank, where I deposited the check last received from Mr Frye to me as Executor of Thomas B. Johnson, and found that the auction Notes deposited there and already due have been all paid except one which is yet under protest. At the House Henry Y. Cranston of Rhode Island took fifty minutes to finish the speech which he began yesterday on the motion of Mr Causin to discharge the select Committee on the memorial of the 23 members of the Rhode-Island Legislature, from the further consideration of the subject— It seems to me that Cranston and Potter should have arrested this movement at the threshold by protesting at once against all action of the house upon it— They were taken by surprize when the first movement was made by Burke; and have not met it with suitable firmness or sagacity—when Cranston closed to day he was followed by George Rathbun of New-York a member of the select Committee and a venomous Van Burenite who spoke to the expiration of the hour and has the floor for to-morrow— Vance, chairman of the Committee of claims moved that the Committees should be called for such Reports as would not give rise to debate, and sundry Reports were accordingly made—among them James I. M’Kay chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, reported a bill to modify and amend the Tariff act of 30. August 1842 M’Kay said he would to-morrow or next Monday at the latest present the report of the majority of the Committee with certain tabular statements which were not yet quite ready— George P. Marsh from the Committee of Naval Affairs, reported a joint Resolution of thanks to the British Authorities at Gibraltar, and the commander, officers and crew of her Britannic Majesty’s ship Malabar for their generous zeal displayed in endeavouring to save from destruction the American Steam frigate Missouri, and in preserving the lives of her Officers and crew, as well as for the kindness and hospitality which characterised their treatment of the ship’s company of that vessel after her unfortunate destruction by fire— This Resolution was read three times and passed without opposition. Hale of New Hampshire did say he would debate it, but upon a single word from Parmenter withdrew his objection— I combined the slave envenomed motive to the building of the ship, the burning thirst for more and more infernal of these machines of Captain Tyler and his late Secretaries Upshur and Gilmer, with the humiliating attitude of thanking those for whose destruction these Engines were intended, for endeavouring to save them and actually saving their crews, and my heart sunk within me for shame. Private bills till past 4, and adjourned. "

                "text": "9. VI. Saturday  I took to the pension office, and left with James L. Edwards, two papers relating to the claim of Bulah Fairbanks for a pension— These papers have been several weeks in my possession, and have escaped my attention, upon my unanswered and unanswerable files— I took also to the Navy Department and read to Commodore Warrington the acting Secretary a Letter from John M Washburn of South Boston, which I had received this morning, praying for the discharge of his brother Thomas S. Washburn, a musician on board of the U.S. line of Battle ship Ohio, in Boston harbour. Commodore Warrington assured me that the discharge should be made out and forwarded this day— At the house, George Rathbun of Auburn 25th. Congressional District of New-York finished his hour speech on the Rhode-Island— Wormwood and gall in answer to Cranston, but without touching upon the sharp points involved in the case— I intend if I can get the floor to make an hour speech on this question, taking for my text nullum numen adest ni sit Prudentia— May I be true to my theme! and may its issue be useful! on this and kindred subjects my heart is too full for my head—and my faculties are in decay.— Cranston indiscreetly denied the right of a majority of the People to change their form of Government at pleasure— Rathbun seized upon this denial, and raved about the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence.— Cranston had spoken with great exasperation about Dorr and his partizans, and the memorialists, with admissions concerning their characters marked more with candour than with controversial address.— Rathbun seized with the ravin of a shark every concession, and turned it to his own purpose, making none in return— When he finished Elisha R Potter took the floor, and as the morning hour was about expiring, only read one section of a law of Virginia against popular movements to overthrow the existing government, and moved to postpone the subject till next Tuesday which was done. M’Kay chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means presented his tariff report, with the tabular statements— Dixon H. Lewis moved to print 25000 extra copies of them; but the Speaker said that motion was not now in order. Joseph R. Ingersoll a member of the Committee said he should present a minority report and claimed that an equal number of that should be printed with the other— Question not taken. The private Calendar was then taken up, and sundry Bills were passed till they came to a Bill for the relief of William Ellery, a fishing bounty claim contested by Cave Johnson; and laid on the table by yeas and nays 72. to 69— Weller moved a reconsideration which stands over— At Dromgoole’s motion the house adjourned to 11. O’Clock A.M. next Monday—that to be thereafter the hour of Meeting daily. "

                "text": "10. VI. Sunday.  There is a delegation from the free church of Scotland in this city consisting of the Revd Dr William Cunningham, the Revd. doctor Robert Burns, the Revd. George Lewis, and H. B. Ferguson Esqr. ruling elder, departed to represent the trying condition of that church, and to solicit contributions in its aid— A public meeting in furtherance of the object of their mission was held last week in Dr Laurie’s church, at which Resolutions in their favour were adopted, and recommended under the signature of 9 clergymen of this city, including the Revd. Septimus Tuston, Chaplain to the Senate— There was also an arrangement made for the preaching of the three Scottish divines at various places this day, and particularly that Dr. Cunningham the associate and friend of the renowned Doctor Chalmers, would preach this morning in the Hall of the house of representatives— This expectation was disappointed as well as that which had been promised last Sunday, of a discourse this day on the Calamity of the ship Princeton, by the House chaplain Mr Tinsley. At ten minutes past 11. I found Mr Tuston at the Clerk’s table, apologizing for the non-appearance of Dr Cunningham, he knew not from what cause, and announcing that he himself should perform the service of the morning. The hall was so crowded in the expectation of hearing Dr Cunningham, that I was unable to find a seat till Mr Follansbee the late door keeper of the house gave me the one he occupied at the extremity of the outer row of the seats of members of the house— It was so distant from the clerk’s table that I could hear scarcely a sentence of Mr Tuston’s discourse; though it was upwards of an hour long. He did not distinctly announce his text but read the whole eighth chapter of Matthew and in his exposition dwelt with much repetition upon the 25th verse—“Lord, save us, we perish”— I walked home and before dinner received visits from General Scott, General Worth and Captain M’Keever of the Navy. After dinner at the second Presbyterian Church I was belated, and found Doctor Robert Burns, preaching from Romans 14.17. [“]For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy ghost.” Neither the person nor the voice of Doctor Burns are prepossessing in his favour, but his discourse was eloquent, methodical, tolerant, practical—full of the spirit of the chapter from which he took his text. Meat and drink were essentials of the Mosaic Law— They were tacitly discarded from the Christian dispensation; and Paul preaching to Jews and Gentiles, exhorts them to mutual toleration, to righteousness, peace and joy in the holy ghost— This doctrine is more acceptable to me, than doubtful disputations about the atonement. After the Sermon, Mr Knox, introduced Dr Burns to me— The house was well filled. "

Brown, who sent me word that he would call upon me— As this was the semi-monthly day of calling for Resolutions, I prepared one for a call upon the President, for information whether he has instituted or engaged in a negotiation for the annexation of Texas to the United States. Just as I was going out to the house, Mr Pakenham called on me to pay a morning visit— I could stay only a few minutes, in which I assured him of my deep anxiety for the preservation of Peace and Harmony between this Country and Great-Britain— He said he was assured of that from sentiments that I had expressed in the house— He said he had rented Mr Webster’s house, and expected to go into it next week. At the house, Cranston made a personal explanation referring to an Article in the globe asserting that Rathbun, had made him take back almost every thing that he had said— Cranston denied that he had taken back any of his assertions— Rathbun controverted some of his explanatory remarks; and Burke questioned him still more—but they did not reply.— There was some bickering about the proceedings of the judiciary committee, relating to a bill for charging the time and place of holding the U.S. Circuit and District Courts in the State of Ohio— A. V. Brown from the Committee on the territories reported a new Oregon territory Bill, extending the Iowa territory to the pacific Ocean. Referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and ordered to be printed— The Speaker commenced the call for Resolutions at South-Carolina, and moved South and West, as far as Ohio— A multitude of Resolutions were offered, and among them two by Cave Johnson, who had given notice of them unnoticed in connivance with the Speaker on Saturday— They restored the rules rescinded at the commencement of the Session, by which a bare majority of the house, can go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and come out of it, at pleasure.— They were both adopted by yeas and nays this day. An attempt was made to fix a day for taking up the new tariff bill, and adhering to it from day to day till finally disposed of.— The motion to lay this on the table was lost by a close vote, and the motion for the previous question by a still closer one; and it failed. An old notice of Giddings to modify the gag-rule was smothered on a point of order— Adjourned at half past 3— Mr Frye was here in the Evening, and proposed to me to go out with him Wednesday morning to the Mill; but I have not time.

Otis and authenticated certificates of his marriage at Matanzas in 1833 with Eleanor Ruston a native of Nassau, New Providence—and of the birth of a Son, George W. Otis, after this marriage, at New-Orleans in 1836. Mr Wolfe’s Letter states that the parties had lived together several years before their marriage, and had four children who are yet living— These children he says did not know that they were born before the marriage of their Parents until this enquiry was brought home to them, by this investigation— That they were resentful at the first disclosure of the fact, and deeply mortified at its final confirmation. Mr Johnson said he would enclose the certificates of the marriage and the birth of the child to Mr Thaxter of Hingham— At the house Hannibal Hamlin of Maine made an explanatory statement by reading an Article in the Boston Courier purporting to be a Letter from the correspondent of that paper at Washington— It charged Hamlin with some silly-speech on a subject upon which he appealed to the whole house to witness that he had not opened his lips.— Charles Hudson asked leave to offer a Resolution to grant the use of the Representative hall for the use of the Congressional Temperance Society next Thursday evening: but objection was made— Hardin moved a suspension of the rules, but failed. Elisha R. Potter made a cool tame speech on the Rhode Island question. When he closed I rose and addressed the Speaker, but he gave the floor to Andrew Kennedy, the rabid Democrat of Indiana— Motions of reconsideration were made of votes for printing extra numbers of copies of the Report of the Commissioner of Patents, and of the Tariff Report and Bill from the Committee of Ways and Means, but both failed— M’Kay chairman of the Committee moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole upon the State of the Union to take up the West point military Academy appropriation bill, which he carried now by a bare majority— Dromgoole was in the chair— Hale of New Hampshire had moved a substitute for the Bill—to abolish the Academy.— Washington Hunt of Lockport 34th. Congressional District of New-York made a judicious and moderate speech in favour of the Academy, and Thomas H Seymour of Hartford first Connecticut Congressional District a hack speech against it— The debate for the day was well-closed by Joseph R Ingersoll, after which the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Captain M’Keever was here and took leave "

Morse of Maine— The late Thomas W. Gilmer’s place not having been supplied— His appointment as Secretary of the Navy; his presentation of his report to the house, and his resignation as a member of the house, were all cotemporaneous with the last meeting of the Committee— His instantaneous and violent death by the bursting of the great Gun of the Princeton, may point a moral, but will not heal the wound inflicted upon Freedom and the rights of human nature by his life— At this meeting Joseph R. Ingersoll, read his report on the Massachusetts Resolves— It is an elaborate eloquent verbose and sophistical counter argument to mine, which he has had in his hands all the time that he has been preparing it. He was two hours in reading it— Garret Davis said that he should also sign it. Edmund Burke said his report was ready, but that he did not wish to read it in Committee. Burt was impatient for the immediate report to the house, but Sample said he wished to prepare a report also; and it was known that Morse intended the same thing.— I objected to presenting the final report to the house until all the separate reports shall have been submitted to the Committee; and we adjourned to meet again Saturday morning at 9 O’Clock— I found the house already in Session, and French was reading the journal of yesterday— George S. Catlin of Connecticut, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, Democrats and Charles Hudson of Masssachusetts whig made a joint onset for a suspension of the rules to obtain the use of the hall for an adjourned congressional temperance Society Meeting next Friday Evening—but they failed for want of a voting quorum and chiefly because Hopkins said it would cost the Nation 20 or 25 dollars for candles— Caleb B. Smith of Indiana took the floor for an hour upon the Rhode-Island Memorial— He exposed the absurdities of Rathbun and Andrew Kennedy with great spirit and scrutinized with great effect the Constitution of New-Hampshire, and the recorded opinions of Martin van Buren, on the right of suffrage— When he finished, I made a third attempt to address the house, but Causin and M’Clernand, struggled also for the floor, and the Speaker gave it for to-morrow to M’Clernand. The West-Point Academy Appropriation Bill occupied the remainder of the day in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.

Calling at the Bank and asking to see my checks I discovered one of the 20th. of February for 100 dollars, which I had forgotten to enter.

Dyer’s auction room and told him that of the notes take by him for payment of articles sold of the effects of Mr T. B. Johnson, all of which have become payable there were two under protest at the Patriotic Bank, for which I should look to him. He said they were both good and he would recover them— At 9 O’Clock, the select Committee on the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts, met in the chamber of the Committee of Manufacturers— Edmund Burke after repeatedly saying that he had no desire to read his report, did read it and occupied little short of two hours— It is an epitome of New Hampshire democracy, mangled up with South-Carolina Slavery, a bitter infusion of partizan malignity, and the oozings out of personal venom against me. Burt immediately moved that the Resolution closing Ingersolls report, that the Committee be discharged from the further consideration of the subject, be reported to the house this day—but Sample wanted further time to prepare his report and Morse confined to his lodgings by indisposition wished also for time to prepare his— I objected to reporting to the house that the Committee be discharged, till all the separate reports shall have been read in Committee— Ingersoll in full concert with Burt was earnest for reporting this day, but Davis more liberal was willing to allow a few days for Sample and Morse to prepare their reports— After some discussion Ingersoll moved that the report asking to be discharged should be made to the house next Saturday, which was carried though whimsically enough Burt, Giddings and myself voted against it.— The Committee adjourned to Saturday next 9. O’Clock— Ingersoll certainly under the spur of Burt, now for the first time objected to my minutes introductory to the journal of the Committee which commences at the second meeting on the 4th. of January— I said that my preliminary matter was only for my own use to complete the journal of the Committee and I did not wish them to be made part of the Journal, if there was any objection to them— At the house—private bills—debate on the cost of engraving— New Committee to superintend engraving of maps— I moved a suspension of the rules for a Resolution calling on the President for information respecting his interference in the Rhode-Island conflicts— Yeas and nays 70 to 62 lost, for lack of a two thirds vote— Adjourned soon after 3. O’Clock— In the evening I had a visit from Mr John Jay of New-York, a son of Judge William Jay— Conversation with him upon Slavery. "

                "text": "17. V:45. Sunday.  The Revd. George Lewis one of the delegates from the free church of Scotland, preached this morning in the Hall of the house of Representatives; from John 18.37. [“]Pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then? Jesus answered, thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth— Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice” The last clause of the verse he omitted— And by what induction of reasoning this text could be brought to bear upon the controversy which now convulses the free church of Scotland, is beyond my comprehension. The preacher divided his discourse into three parts—maintaining that Jesus Christ was to be considered in three different capacities as prophet, priest, and king; and that if Pilate had asked him art thou a prophet or art thou a priest? he would have given the same answer—to this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth— Now that all this should have some affinity to the doctrine of the atonement which the Reverend Orator assured his hearers was now the true orthodox creed of the free church of Scotland did not so much surprize me, as the transition from these articles of faith, to the question whether the ministers of the church of Scotland, shall continue to be appointed as they have been heretofore appointed by noble patrons or elected by the people of their parishes, and he said that 500 ministers of the church of Scotland had agreed to renounce their pecuniary compensation, to an amount of half a million dollars, rather than submit any longer to be appointed by Patrons— And he said it was a matter of as deep interest to us as it was to them— He said something of Puseyism and something of Romanism; but the upshot of it all, as I believe is democracy— The popular principle creeping in to the religious creed of the atonement. After dinner at the second presbyterian church, I heard the Revd. Benjamin H. Cheever, of the methodist episcopal conference now sitting in this city, preach from 1. John 3.2. [“]Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.” inexplicable mysticism.— The preacher commented ingeniously upon the link of argument that in the future world the faithful believer shall be like Christ: because he shall see him as he is.

Davis moved to suspend the rules, to call the Committees for reports; but not succeeding George W. Jones moved a suspension of the rules for one hour to receive such reports as would give rise to no debate— This was carried, but it was a snare— Weller from the Committee of Ways and Means reported a resolution to print 15000 copies extra of the report of the committee accompanying the subtreasury bill— John White late Speaker objected, and insisted that the motion could not be entertained—the suspension of the rules being conditional only for undebatable reports— The Speaker so decided, but suffered himself to be worried by Weller’s overbearing pertinacity so far as to receive the motion, and lay it over till to-morrow— Campbell chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, reported a Bill to extend the charters of the District Banks—and a report— M’Causland moved to lay the bill on the table; but after some sputtering withdrew his motion— The bill was referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and was ordered with the report to be printed— Charles J.

Newton, of Pittsfield, a member of the Council of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, had entertained me with the kindest hospitality at his house last Summer—had taken a conspicuous lead in my public reception there, and had on other occasions manifested the same spirit personally toward me— He is now here on a visit, with his daughter and Miss Belknap a granddaughter of the eminent Divine, and historian Dr Belknap— I could not suffer them to pass away without notice— Mr John Jay with his wife and two young ladies from New-York, had similar claims to my attention, and many members of Congress and others with their families have visited us, whose civilities required some acknowledgment of return— My wife therefore issued cards of invitation for a party this evening to about 250 persons of our acquaintance and I invited personally this day about 30 members of the house of Representatives. Our friends Mr and Mrs Stockton, who had intended to leave us yesterday postponed their departure till to-morrow— My next door neighbour at Quincy George W. Beale and his relative Mr Wayles called on us this morning— They come South for refuge from the chill eastern spring winds, and very threatening symptoms of pulmonary disease— Mr Beale and Mrs Wayle’s are both far gone with consumption— At the house, Resolutions from State Legislatures were presented and received without objection, by Alcee La Branche from Louisiana—by Benjamin A. Bidlack from Pennsylvania, and by Benjamin F. Hammett from Mississippi— One of the last was for the annexation of Texas and no objection was made to the reception of that— John A.

But Hale gave notice that he would move a reconsideration to-morrow— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Cave Johnson in the chair on the fortification bill, finally rose for want of a quorum, and the house adjourned at half past 4— In the evening we had our social party—upwards of 200 persons, from 8 O’Clock till some time past Midnight— It went off happily.— "

Stockton, a purser in the Navy, and his wife, once Miss Ann M’Knight and afterwards Mrs Twiggs, who have been on a pleasant visit to us of three weeks, left us this morning to return to Philadelphia. The debate at the house on the bill to remove the United States Circuit and District Courts in the State of Ohio from Cincinnati to Columbus, was renewed on the motion of John P. Hale of Dover, New-Hampshire, to reconsider the vote by which the bill was yesterday past— The report of Saunders yesterday from the judiciary Committee had been against the passage of the bill so that he readily assented to the reconsideration which sent the bill back to the question upon its passage— The delegation from the State were divided rather by a lure of local interests than of politics. Duncan and Weller two of the bitterest democrats in the house, were at sharp points between Cincinnati and Columbus— A further reconsideration of the vote by which the bill had been engrossed was necessary to place it in an amendable condition that is at the second reading—this was done, and Saunders offered an amendment, and then the bill passed again the second and third reading, whereupon Samuel Simons of Bridgeport Connecticut moved another reconsideration—which the Speaker decided to be inadmissible; a second motion for reconsideration, after one has been carried, not being in order— Duncan appealed from the decision, saying that after the adoption of an amendment it was no longer the same vote— The speaker stubbornly persisting in his decision, got into a sharp altercation with John White the Speaker of the last house, in which he came off second best, so that when it came to the issue by yeas and nays the vote was a tie 73 to 73. and his decision was sustained only by his own vote— The Rhode-Island Memorial then came up, and Lemuel Stetson wasted an hour, in a laboured and very dull defence of the changeable opinions of Martin Van Buren upon the extension of the right of suffrage— When he closed, I again addressed the chair and said I wished to say a few words, but the Speaker said he had assigned the floor to Mr Simonds. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Cave Johnson in the Chair— The discussion upon the fortification bill was closed and it was laid aside, and at the motion of Haralson chairman of the Committee of Military Affairs, the bill from the Senate to remount the old second Regiment of Dragoons was taken up— M’Kay very faintly opposed it— Hale moved an amendment which he knew was not in order, to disband the 8th. Regiment of Infantry— I moved to disband the rifle regiment itself: and spoke about half an hour. "

                "text": "21. VI. Thursday.  I made about half my speech yesterday in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— My time last Evening and this morning was absorbed in looking up the journals and proceedings of the second Session of the last Congress upon the reduction of the army, and the dismounting of the second regiment of dragoons, and turning it into a rifle regiment— At the house after some miscellaneous business, part of which was a memorial presented by George W. Summers from the Colonization Society of the District of Columbia, praying for aid from Congress, the Rhode-Island Memorial was taken up. Samuel Simonds of Bridgport Connecticut had the floor, upon Causin’s motion to discharge the select Committee from the further consideration of the memorial. Simonds moved the previous question, whereupon Burke asked leave to modify his motion for leave to send for persons and papers so as to limit the call to two persons in Rhode-Island with papers— The Speaker pronounced this modification not in order, under the previous question— The main question was first on Causin’s motion to discharge the Committee which was lost by yeas and nays 70 to 86— Then on the resolution of leave to send for persons and papers, which Elmer moved to lay on the table—lost 72 to 84. and the resolution was then carried. 78 to 71.— I had repeatedly requested to be heard, and John P. Kennedy had appealed to the generosity of the house to indulge me, but Dromgoole said it could not be done— John J. Hardin of Illinois, voted with the majority for the privilege of moving a reconsideration which he did, and thereby tricked out an hour speech which he devoted exclusively to a reply to Stetson’s vindication of Martin Van Buren— He closed by moving the previous question on his motion to reconsider; which he did, to withdraw it upon my rising to follow him; but before he closed a motion was made to lay on the table his motion to reconsider— Weller moved a call of the house, which consumed a full hour, and produced only 171 members, when further proceedings were suspended, when Burke’s motion to lay on the table, the motion to reconsider was carried 89 to 77. I asked Burke to move now his promised call on the President for information and documents concerning the Rhode Island quarrel; but he said he would move the call, when it should be in order. I have thus been by concerted action of the Speaker excluded from speaking on this subject—  A remarkable circumstance of the present times is the habitual absence of more than 50 members of the house about 30 of them in the city always ready to answer a party summons but seldom seen at any other time, in the house— They are paid as if they attended 12 hours a day— Full half the time there is no Quorum in the house— After the passage of the Resolution allowing the Committee on the Rhode-Island Memorial to send for persons and papers, the House went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and took up the bill to repeal the provision of the act of August 1842, which converted the second regiment of dragoons into a rifle regiment— I completed my hour speech, and was just entering upon the most interesting point of it, when Cave Johnson, the Chairman’s hammer came down like the Razor of the guillotine— Haralson the chairman of the Committee of Military Affairs answered me by an hour Speech and the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Mr Grinnell and Mr Winthrop, had invited me to meet at their lodgings the whig members of the Massachusetts delegation, to have some consultation together, upon some of the measures under consideration of the house— I went accordingly at 7 in the evening, and before the meeting, saw in the drawing room Mrs Grinnell, Mr and Mrs Henry Cabot of Boston, and the Senators, Bates, Dayton and Miller fellow boarders at Mrs Whitwell’s house— At the meeting we discoursed upon Texas, the Tariff, the Massachusetts Resolves and the Virginia Counter-Resolutions. Mr Abbot is a member of the select Committee on the latter, and said he had not been notified to attend any meeting of the Committee— We came to no definite conclusion upon any thing— I came home at 10.

Friday  Mr Francis Markoe of the Department of State, the main pillar of the National Institute had sent me last week the Memorial of that body to Congress which I had agreed to present to the house of Representatives, and which Levi Woodbury presented yesterday to the Senate. Mr Markoe had requested an interview with me, and I had promised to call on him but was prevented from performing my promise by visitors upon business or curiosity at the only time when I could have performed it— On going to the house this morning, I met Mr Markoe, at the door of the Hall, where he was watching to meet me, and he asked a short conference with me; for which purpose we retired into the chamber of the committee of manufactures: he had with him a mass of manuscript documents forming a folio volume as thick as a Corpus Juris, to be communicated to the house with the memorial, and which he wishes to have printed with it— I promised to present the memorial on the first day when it will be in order— Mr Markoe urged me with great importunity to take active part at the anniversary meeting of the Institute to be held next Month; especially by delivering an address, though it should be only of a few minutes; but I gave him no encouragement to expect it. I said however that I would do all in my power to promote the objects of the Institute— I found the house in Session—there had been a motion for a call of the house to obtain a quorum; but in the progress of the motion for the call a quorum having appeared the call was refused by yeas and nays 66 to 75— The yeas and nays were also taken upon Weller’s motion to print 15000 extra copies of the sub-treasury bill report from the Committee of Ways and Means. 108 to 51. And upon a motion of Garret Davis to suspend the rules for him to introduce a new rule requiring the Clerk to call over the roll every morning, and record the members present and the absentees 85 to 86. Milton Brown moved a suspension for a call on the Secretary of the Treasury for a return of losses by Banks—74 to 94— The Speaker called for reports from select Committees, and Dromgoole presented a Report from the select Committee appointed on the 9th. on the counter resolutions of the Legislatures of Virginia and Alabama, to the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts ofMarch 1843— The Committee consisted of Dromgoole, Rhett of South-Carolina Boyd of Kentucky, Amos Abbott of Massachusetts, Redding of New-Hampshire, Strong of New-York, Brengle of Maryland, Roberts of Mississippi and Clinch of Georgia. The report was short and closed with two Resolutions—one that the compromises of the Constitution ought to be held sacred, and the other that no proposition of amendment of the Constitution with regard to representation and direct taxation ought to be recommended by Congress, but that every such proposition ought to be promptly and decisively condemned. He moved the previous question on the resolutions.— I asked him to withdraw his motion, to allow me to move the reference of the report and resolutions to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—for discussion—he refused— Winthrop moved a call of the house—refused. Abbott said he had never been notified of any meeting of the select Committee or of the report— Dromgoole said he had sent a messenger boy to notify all the members of the Committee— That all the members members had attended except Mr Abbott who was sick, and Mr Strong and MrBrengle who had both gone home— And the report was unanimous— The previous question was carried—by yeas and nays 118 to 51— Parmenter moved to lay the report and resolutions on the table— Winthrop moved as an amendment until the question is decided whether the annexation of Texas be considered as the settled policy of this Government—which the Speaker decided was not in order— The motion to lay on the table was lost 48 to 132—and a question being taken on each resolution, the first was carried 128 to 18—and the second 127 to 41.— These votes in immediate succession to each other show that of the minority on the second 23 did not vote on the first, at all— Steenrod moved a reconsideration, for the purpose of having it rejected; and it was rejected without a discussion—before the last vote by yeas and nays the Speaker announced that the morning hour had expired, but Dromgoole moved to suspend the rules to finish this business and it was carried— The whole matter was disposed of in the space of an hour and a half— After which Haralson moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the bill for restoring and remounting the second regiment of dragoons; which the house refused; and the rest of the day was engaged in the consideration of private bills; some 30 of which were passed in the house, or reported from the Committee of the whole Samuel F. Vinton in the chair.— The house adjourned soon after 3. O’Clock— I had a morning call from Mr Connell urgent for the passage of the bill for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton— But on the first and fourth Friday of each month only those bills against which there is no objection are considered, and there was objection to the Fulton bill though it has repeatedly passed the house— Evening visitors Mr Edward A. Newton, and Mr Rockwell— Also Mr Daniel R. Goodloe, who brought me a note to his manuscript written to obviate an objection which I had suggested to a part of his theory— He is now desirous to have his essay published in some newspaper, and I promised to read his note; and he promised to call on me again to-morrow evening.

O’Clock, the dwelling house of the late tax collector Billings’ widow in our neighbourhood was burnt down— The fire caught from hot ashes, stowed away in a barrel.  Meeting at 9. O’Clock this morning of the select Committee on the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts ofMarch 1843 proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the U.S. whereby Representation and direct taxation shall be apportioned according to the numbers of free population.— All the members of the Committee present, though two of them came in late— Mr Sample of Indiana read his report which occupied about an hour— A split-difference Laodicean dissertation neither hot nor cold or rather both hot and cold. Mr Morse asked further time till next Tuesday week to prepare his report, pleading sickness, and occupations on other committees, and his own indecision on whether he would make a separate report or not, for an allowance of further time— There had been a vote last Saturday that the Report to the house should be made this day— I moved a reconsideration of that vote, and the postponement of the report to the house till Tuesday the 2d. of April. This was carried; Burke, Burt and Ingersoll voting against it— I moved that a list of 16 petitions referred to the Committee should be entered on the minutes of the journal—which was resisted in a provoking spirit of chicanery, because they had not been read and acted upon in Committee— The question was not taken on my motion— The Committee adjourned, to Tuesday Morning 2. April— After the adjournment, Burt gave me notice that he should move in the house an order to the Committee to report to the house immediately— He afterwards came to my seat, and said that he should not make his motion till Monday— I found the house in Session, and immediately after I entered, the Speaker evidently in concert with Burt, called for Reports from select Committees.— But Burt was not ready with his motion, and I was silent— But Burke, chairman of the select Committee on the Rhode-Island Memorial, moved a long and minutely detailed call upon the President, for documents relating to his interference in the insurgent movements in Rhode-Island in 1842. The motion was adopted without a word of opposition or of comment— The first three legislative days of May were assigned for the consideration of business relating to the district of Columbia—and Parmenter moved a call of enquiry, about wrought iron, the burning of the Missouri and then private Bills till the house adjourned— Daniel R. Goodloe here again this Evening— At this critical moment an affliction comes over me of inflammation in the left eye, and a tremulous hand disqualifying me almost entirely for writing or reading. "

                "text": "24. V. Sunday.  The inflammation of my left eye and the tremulation of my right hand in grievous afflictions. They render it impossible to keep my record with the current of time— In the hall of the house of Representatives this morning I heard a long discourse from the Revd. Mr Kincaid a missionary to Burmah, where he and his wife now with him have been about 13 years, and have returned to this country for the restoration of her health— Burmah is called an empire in the peninsula of India, and bordering on China— It is under British dependency, with the instrumentality of Semi-sovereign native princes, and subject to the incursions of robber chieftains, whose remorseless cruelties Mr Kincaid has witnessed and described with deep sensibility.— The religion of Burmah is Buddhism, but the missionaries are tolerated and Mr Kincaid says they have fifty churches in that country— His text was from Isaiah 9.2. [“]The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death; upon them hath the light shined.” but he gave out only the first part of the verse. He related with much emphasis, and incident in which he escaped almost miraculously from death, and another of which he was an eye-witness in which a woman of dignified deportment and distinguished condition with several of her children around her, was whipped to death with a rattan, by a robber chief to force her to disclose her property. After dinner I attended at St. John’s church, where Mr Hawley read the evening service for the 5th. Sunday in Lent, and preached from 1. Peter 1.22 “Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth, through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, so that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.” Mr Hawley’s sermons are all in one strain, and attest his kindness of feeling not less than his piety— Coming out of Church I met Dr Thomas and requested him to call and see my wife confined to her bed with an attack of Erisypelas striking at the lungs, as in my case the same skyey? influence has fallen upon my eyes— The Doctor made his visit accordingly and I visited at Galebrun’s, Mr Daniel D. Barnard, who has been confined ten days to his chamber indisposition— His constitution is slender and his countenance bears marks of recent suffering.— His wife arrived with their youngest daughter last Evening from Albany. I had about an hour of conversation with him upon political topics— In no wise cheering.— The Peacemakers explosion was a judgment upon men, but no defeat of purposes— Mysterious Heaven!—and let they will be done! Charles B. King the portrait painter, spent part of the Evening alone with me— Cry of fire. "

I have now struggled nearly five years without the interval of a day while mind and body have been wearing away under the daily silent but unremitting erosion of time— I rose this morning at 4. and with smarting blood shod eye, and shivering hand still sat down and wrote to fill up the chasm of the closing days of the last week;—but my stern chase of time, is to borrow a simile from Tom Paine, like the race of a man with a wooden leg after a horse. At the house it was the regular day for the call of Resolutions; but James A. Black of South-Carolina, chairman of a select Committee on Retrenchment, presented a report with a bill to regulate the pay of the army and for other purposes—twice read and ordered to be printed—and after some chicanery 5000 extra-copies of the report were ordered to be printed— Black said the merit of the bill consisted in reducing half a million of dollars a year of the public expenditures— Fudge! The Speaker began the call for Resolutions, with Ohio proceeding West and South— Giddings offered Counter Resolutions, asserting the right of proposing amendments to the Constitution against those adopted last Friday— They lie over for debate— Burt of South-Carolina made his threatened Motion to require the select Committee on the Massachusetts Resolutions to-morrow morning— After some sparring altercation, and a statement of the facts by me, I moved to lay Burt’s resolution on the table and it was carried by a majority of two votes— Woodward then offered the same resolution in the same words— I objected to it as not in order; and the Speaker so decided— Woodward then modified his resolution as to call for the report on Wednesday morning— I moved to lay that on the table, and it was again carried— Lucas of Virginia afterwards moved that another member be appointed on the Committee in the place of T. W. Gilmer, which was carried without opposition— After a multitude of other Resolutions John P. Kennedy offered one, declaring the approbation of the house of certain protective tariff opinions, expressed by Andrew Jackson in a Letter to Doctor J. H. Coleman April 26. 1824. which produced a prodigious perplexity among the Jackson gang, that they could deliver themselves of it only by a premature and precepitant adjournment— Mr Goodloe came this evening, with his manuscript—sealed up; and I directed to Charles King of the . . .guon American; written with much abilities "

L. Ellsworth, came with Jeremiah E. Cary of Cherry valley, member from the 21st. congressional district of New-York, Otsego and Scoharie, and delivered to me a Letter from himself, with one from Julius Pratt and Co. Manufacturers at Meriden Connecticut, and a present of a milk white Ivory cane, one yard long made of one elephant’s tooth, tip’d with silver and steel, with the American eagle in laid in gold on its top and a ring under the pommel, inscribed with my name, and the words Justum et tenacem propositi virum.— The Letter requests that on the day when the gag rule shall be finally abolished I will insert the date after the inscription on the ring— After expressing my deep sensibility to this testimonial of kindness and approbation of my public conduct, I promised a written answer to Mr Pratt’s Letter, and alluding to my custom of declining valuable presents from individuals for public service, I accepted the cane as a trust to be returned when the date of the extinction of the gag-rule shall be accomplished. At the house, three hours were consumed in a conclusive struggle to get rid of John P. Kennedy’s Resolution, quoting and adopting General Jackson’s explicit declaration in favour of a protective tariff in 1824— Brown of Indiana, offered a lame apology for introducing yesterday a spurious counter sentiment of Henry Clay; but while acknowledging that he could not now substantiate the fact by proof he attempted to reiterate the charge by recurring to a report of another speech of Clay seeming to give colour to the same charge.— John White fastened, upon him and against a tide and torrent of interruptions prostrated the calumny against Clay, till he drove the Speaker to the last resort of the gag to stop him for irrelevancy— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Cave Johnson in the chair— The Bill for remounting the second regiment of Dragoons came up— Jameson of Missouri—Cross of Arkansas and above all Henry Dodge the delegate from Wisconsin urged so intensely the necessity of mounted men for defence against and controul over the Indians, that all resistance was vain— I withdrew my amendment to disband the regiments and the bill was reported to the house, and passed by yeas and nays 94 to 56—only 150 votes—40. dodgers not yet broken in to hail the triumph of the military power.

The rules were suspended 103 to 43— And the resolution adopted, 90 to 63. all amendment being precluded by the previous question— I voted for the suspension and for the resolution: thinking that the main allegation that the General had ordered away and then arrested an officer under examination as a witness by a Committee of the house, was a fit subject of enquiry; but I totally disapproved the direct imputation upon the motives of the General, at all events unnecessary, and as I believed unfounded.— Schenk moved to suspend the rules, to take up the joint Resolution from the Senate to close the Session on the 27th. of May—88 to 81. Rules not suspended— The 1st. 2d. and 3d. days of May were assigned for consideration of the business of the District of Columbia— Two bills to incorporate a grand lodge of odd fellows—and a grand lodge of Masons were laid on the table— The last by yeas and nays 132—to 30.

It embraces a period of eleven years and takes pupils by classes— He has been striving to carry it into execution for six years, but with so little success that his school at Troy in New Hampshire has been broken up by mere malicious opposition, and he is now going to repeat the experiment in the interior of Virginia— He has also a scheme for effecting a revolution in the spelling of the English language, by means of a new alphabet of forty letters each of which with a distinct sound— The man is a reasoning monomaniac combining his ideas with ingenious skill and consistency, without a suspicion of its radical absurdity.— At the house the Speaker called for Reports from the Committees— I presented the memorial from the Directors of the National Institute praying for aid from Congress; and moved its reference to the joint Committee on the library; but objection was made and it was laid over— Dromgoole offered a Resolution, that an issue of Treasury notes made by the Secretary of the Treasury, at a nominal interest, and made payable by endorsement on demand is without authority of Law, and moved its reference with a Letter from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— I asked with some surprize if this resolution was from the Committee of Ways and Means—Dromgoole said no— He offered it in his individual capacity as a member of the house— It passed without a word more said— M’Kay from the Committee of Ways and Means moved a suspension of the rules to make the tariff bill the special order of the day for the 9th. of April and every day after till finally disposed of—vote by yeas and nays 94 to 79— Not two thirds— M’Kay then gave notice that on the 9th. of April and every succeeding day he would move to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the tariff bill.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Weller in the Chair, on the army appropriation Bill.

Davis to abolish the office of Major General; in which I took a part with a view to do full justice to General Scott; for which his friend Clinch cordially thanked me— The subsequent factions of the bills were largely debated by Walter Coles, member from the third Congressional district of Virginia. Coles moved several amendments; none of which succeeded, till near four O’Clock when the Committee rose and the house adjourned. "

Saturday—  Apricot trees in full blossom first observed yesterday  At the house this morning, the answer of the Secretary of War, William Wilkins, to the resolution adopted last Wednesday under the screw of the previous question, and containing a rash and offensive imputation upon the conduct and character of General Scott was communicated by the Speaker, and read— It completely justifies the proceedings of General Scott in the transactions to which the resolution applied, transfers the load of censure upon Lieutenant Bragg, and justly rebukes the scandalous enquiry as to the motives of General Scott— The whole proceeding is characteristic of the malignant stolidity of James G. Clinton and of the base subserviency of the majority of the house, to the venomous passions of the meanest of their party hacks— General Clinch called for the reading of the report and the accompanying documents, and the printing of 2000 extra copies of them, but the report only was read— The documents were ordered to be printed but no extra number of them— General Clinch told me he had informed General Scott of the Speech I had yesterday in his defence, for which he returned me his thanks; and with which he was highly gratified— Hungerford moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Carried against the private business, 87 to 61— The bill to regulate the pay of the army was taken up, Weller in the chair— John Pettit of La Fayette, 9th congressional district of Indiana moved to strike out the 17th. section of the Bill fixing the pay of chaplains in the army at 600 dollars a year— And made a speech against having any chaplains.— The same man had moved at the commencement of the present Session of Congress had moved to dispense with chaplains in both houses— He met with no support then—nor with any now— Holmes of Charleston, South-Carolina, Hammett of Mississippi, Joseph R. Ingersoll and Edward Joy Morris of Philadelphia and Hardin of Illinois made counter speeches for display and John Wentworth of Illinois one of vulgar hypocritical buffoonery, with continual bitter allusions to the songs at the whig mass-meetings. This called up Caleb B. Smith of Indiana; when Steenrod interposed, and by the most urgent intreaties prevailed upon Pettit to withdraw his motion— But the agitation was such that the Committee immediately rose— Joseph R. Ingersoll moved to adjourn to one O’Clock on Monday, to allow time for members to attend the opening of the anniversary meeting of the National Institute; but he failed— The house adjourned before 3 O’Clock "

I attended public worship this morning at the Capitol with Mrs John Adams her daughter Mary-Louisa and Isaac Hull— The preacher was Mr Tinsley the chaplain of the house, and his text was from Romans 1–16—“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God, unto salvation to every one that believeth: to the Jew first and also to the Greek”— He discoursed only upon the first clause of the verse, and upon that very briefly— He observed on the great benefit to the cause of Religion, by the example set by persons distinguished in the world, by not being ashamed of the gospel of Christ and he paid a laudable tribute of gratitude to the late Thomas W. Gilmer by whose nomination and influence he was appointed chaplain to the house; testifying to his fervent piety, and his continual devotion to prayer— The whole service lasted scarcely an hour— The prayer not more than 5 minutes— Mr Tinsley gave out 3 hymns—always setting the tune himself, and singing and reading alternately two lines, all but alone— He does not practice reading a chapter of the Bible— After the service, Mr Daniel P. King came to my seat with Mr Henry Wilson, a Member of the Senate of Massachusetts from the County of Middlesex, and the person at whose house I slept, when I delivered a lecture at Natick in November 1842.— At St. John’s church in the afternoon Mr Hawley read the evening service for the Sunday before Easter otherwise called Palm Sunday, and preached from Luke 19.41. [“]And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it. 42. Saying, if thou hadst known, even thou at least in this thy day the things that belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.” This was said by Jesus on the day of his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, five days before his crucifixion—said on the day of which this is celebrated as the anniversary. The chapter of Luke from which the text was taken contains the record of the proceedings of that day, which was assigned by Mr Hawley as his reason for taking it as his text, but it is not in the prayer book as a part of the service of the day.— The first Lesson of the day being the 26th and the gospel of the morning service the 27th of Matthew— The saying is understood to be prophetic of the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem by the Romans under Titus considered as a judgment of God, in punishment of the City as accessary to the crucifixion of Jesus.— Mr Hawley did not consider it either in the prophetic or in the historical aspect—but only as an exhortation— Mr Connell was here this evening.

March came in very gently, but after a heavy rain last Friday night and Saturday morning, a Northwester swept off all the clouds and a sharp frost last night has blighted all the Apricot blossoms just opened in beauty.— This is the anniversary week of the National Institute for which such an ostentatious parade of preparation has been made. The members of the Institute, and the scientific Strangers attending here by invitation from the Society met at ten this morning at the Library chamber of the Treasury department. I went there as a member, and as a delegate with Rufus Choate and Robert C. Winthrop from the Massachusetts antiquarian Society. I delivered the credentials to the Secretary of the Institute Francis Markoe with a Letter from Thomas S. Hinde— The meeting was numerous and they marched in procession, with the President of the United States, as Patron of the Institute at their head to the presbyterian church, in 4 1/2 street where he presided and Robert J Walker the Senator from Mississippi delivered the Anniversary Address. He was followed by Professor Draper of New-York and professor Loomis of Ohio with scientific essays— I left the chamber at the Treasury Department before the President of the United States came in, to attend my duty at the house where I expected to present the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts against the annexation of Texas— It was the day for the receipt of petitions and Memorials among which are included the Resolutions of State Legislatures— But this had been superseded by the assignment of this and the two succeeding days for the consideration of business relating to the Territories.— The Committee of the whole was discharged from the consideration of sundry territorial bills which had been referred to it, and they were referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Several new Bills came in to . . .ed and referred—to the same Committee— The house then went into that Committee and rapidly drove through numerous bills till they came to one authorising the President of the United States to sell the reserved lead mines, in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin which started a long and a sharp debate— Cave Johnson moved an amendment requiring a preliminary survey and examination of the value of the lands, but it was rejected.— The purpose of the bill is to enable the squatters to obtain for 1 dollar and 35 cents an acre, lands worth at least ten dollars an acre— The bill was however arrested for the day on the question of engrossment and the house adjourned "

Sample’s motion made at the last meeting that a list of the Petitions referred to the Committee and reported upon, should be appended to the journal, was discussed and on taking the question by yeas and nays, Adams Giddings, Sample and Morse voted ay— Burke, Burt, Lucas and Ingersoll voted no. At my request Davis was sent for to give the casting vote, but was not found; whereupon Ingersoll moved with some immaterial modification the same resolution and it was carried against the votes of Burke, Burt, and Lucas— I was then instructed to report to the house, the Resolution that the Amendment to the Constitution proposed by the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts ought not to be recommended; and the resolution asking that the Committee should be discharged from the further consideration of the subject; and the journal and the Committee adjourned without day—each member to present his own report to the house— Ingersoll however had not made up the journal, and no opportunity for presenting the report to the house occurred, this day— In the house it was the second day for the consideration of business relating to the territories, and the bills were despatched with so much expedition first in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, John White in the chair, and then in the house that soon after two O’Clock all the territorial bills were cleared off from the Speaker’s table— But there had been some previous debate on a bill to authorise the President of the United States to sell the lead mines in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin upon which a motion of Parmenter to lay the bill on the table was lost by yeas and nays 66 to 82—and in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Weller in the chair the bill to regulate the pay of the army was resumed and debated till half past four when the Committee rose and the house adjourned. Cave Johnson moved that all debate on this bill, in Committee of the whole should cease next Thursday at 2 O’Clock P.M, which was carried— I had visits from Orson Pratt and John E.

Second sleepless Night  Pratt is a commissioned agent from Joseph Smith the mayor of the city of Nauvoo in the State of Illinois and Chief and prophet of the Mormons or latter day Saints, a new fanatical religious sect, who have occasioned great troubles and suffered great persecutions in the State of Missouri, from which they have been expelled by popular violence and the Government of the State. Page is a preacher of the gospel of the same sect now residing here— Pratt has two memorials from them to Congress, complaining of the injuries they have received and claiming protection and redress— Pratt said he was instructed to ask an interview, first with the delegation from Illinois, and secondly from Massachusetts— I notified the members present from Massachusetts who agreed, to meet Pratt to-morrow morning in the chamber of the Committee of manufactures— Except Henry Williams who declined to attend— Mr R. S. Morsell came and paid me the annual instalment, on our agreement of 28 March 1839.— At the house John W. Davis was meeting some obstacle to getting in a minority report, when I helped him through by making it the occasion of slipping in my report and the resolutions and journal of the select Committee on the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts— I moved that all the Reports should be laid on the table and printed— Instantly a Porcupine of objections bristled up against me. Burt immediately called again for the reading of my report, and said he could not vote for its being printed unless it should be read— I said I had no objection, though it would occupy two hours and be exceedingly tedious and if my report should be read I should of course require that they should all be read— Burt persisted, and the clerk began to read my report, but he had not proceeded half a page before they arrested him, and there was a long struggle of chicanery to defeat the printing of my report— They finally took by yeas and nays on the Resolution that the amendment of the Constitution recommended by the Massachusetts Legislature ought not to be recommended—carried 153 to 13. Then that the Committee should be discharged from the further consideration of the subject—adopted without division— Ingersoll, Burke, Sample and Morse presented their several reports, and my motion was that they should all be laid on the table and printed— The motion to lay them on the table worried through with some edging— Saunders moved to lay the motion to print on the table.

H. Agnew of New-York, on the glacier system or period of Agassez a recent counter absurdity to that of Buffon, who supposed this globe to be a ball of fire struck off by the tail of a Comet from the Sun— Agassez represents it as a metallic ball covered over originally with a crust of ice— The house was crowded— The air uncomfortably warm; and I was at one time oppressed to faintness and went into the vestibule of the church to breathe fresh air— I came home again to a sleepless bed— Again I rose about two in the morning, and forced my shaking hand to write till the dawn of day between 4 and 5 where I returned to bed, and in wakeful slumber lay till after Sunrise— At the house this morning— The order for printing ten thousand extra copies of Joseph R. Ingersoll’s minority report on the tariff, from the Committee of Ways and Means, was after a mean struggle to suppress it, extorted from a two thirds vote— It is but half the number, already ordered of the majority report— It was private bill day—but John W. Tibbatts of the 10th. congregational district of Kentucky moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the bill making appropriations for the improvement of certain harbours and rivers. Vance pleaded for the private claimants in vain— The house went into Committee, Linn Boyd in the chair, and the river and harbor bill, was buffeted between the parties upwards of two hours— Garrett Davis turned it into an electioneering battle ground by an hour speech of invective upon Martin Van Buren, and his administration— W. W. Payne of Alabama answered him by a counterblast against the whigs, reinforced with another hour of railing by James B. Bowlin of St. Louis, Missouri; after which the Committee rose and the house adjourned— My wife sent for Dr Thomas, who came and prescribed soporifics. At 7 this Evening I went with my wife and family to the roman catholic church of St. Matthew and heard the Stabat Mater of Rossini performed— That of Pergolezi followed and a Sermon; but I was obliged to leave the church; which was excessively crowded to an evening party at the house of Mr John C. Spencer, the Secretary of the Treasury— By him and his lady and daughter I was greeted, with much kindness. "

This morning Mr Thomas Johnson came to make enquiries about a claim of a person named Della Francia, connected with the old West Florida, Kemper insurrection claims; settled three or four times, all more than twenty years ago, and the details of which have long since been extinguished from my Memory— I told Mr Johnson that I had some remembrance that the name of Della Francia was one of those for whom settlement was made with Mr Kemper; but that all the documents with which I had ever been conversant relating to this business were at the Department of State— Mr Alexander H. Everett also called on me this morning. He is here in attendance on the meetings of the National Institute, and is to deliver a discourse at the last meeting next Monday evening. At the house the first business was a motion of Tibbatts to take the bill making appropriations for certain harbours and rivers out of Committee of the whole on the state of the Union this day at two O’Clock which was carried— Then David L. Seymour of Troy, New-York, made his separate minority report from the Committee of Ways and Means, on the Tariff; and 10000 extra copies of it were ordered to be printed— The house then went into committee of the whole on the state of the Union on the river and harbour bill, and then commenced the jarring and sparring of the western members for addition of appropriations—not a river, not a creek, not a nook or corner from Pittsburgh to Galvezton, but was to be stuffed with sweetmeats from the Treasury besides 3 times 75000 dollars for the Cumberland road and 25000 dollars for a bridge over the Ohio— At 2 O’Clock the debate ceased and the voting to reject amendments commenced, and continued till past 4. O’Clock, when the bill with sundry amendments was reported to the house but could not get no further now. The house adjourned— The account was this day received of the death of Heman Allen Moore late member from Columbus Ohio. "

V:30 Sunday  Professor Bache and Mr Markoe, called on me this morning, and urged me with so much importunity to preside at one of the meetings of the National Institute, to-morrow, the last day of the anniversary week, that after stating to them the condition of my health disqualifying me for presiding over any public meeting, I finally yielded to their intreaties; and consented to preside at the morning meeting— As the house of Representatives will only meet to receive notice of the decease of Heman Allen Moore the member from Columbus Ohio, to hear his funeral eulogy, and to pass the usual honorary resolutions and adjourn— In the hall of the house of Representatives I heard a sermon by Professor Caswell of Brown University—Providence—from Psalm 97.1. “The Lord reigneth: let the earth rejoice”—the remainder of the verse “let the multitude of isles be glad thereof”—was not included in the text— It is but the repetition of the same idea—the natural propensity of joyous exultation— This precept to rejoice in the omnipotence of God is founded upon the tacit prejudication that he reigns in righteousness, and overrules all evil for good— But if the power of God is manifested in destruction, how can we rejoice? If Satan triumphs over truth and justice how can we rejoice? In humble resignation to the will of God, we may submit to afflictive dispensations without a murmur, confiding in the hope that justice will at last prevail; but are joy and sorrow at our command? The text seems so to presuppose— The theme is copious, and was not thoroughly explored by Professor Caswell— His text was regularly divided into the boundless power of God; easily illustrated—and the duty to rejoice for it, the only contestible point of the doctrine, but which the professor neither contested, nor stated the objections by which it is contested— The auditory was thin, and the Sermon not unacceptable— Mr wife and family attended the service of Easter morning, performed by Mr Hawley at St. John’s Church— As I was returning from the Capitol I met Mr Pakenham the new Minister from Great Britain, who had just called at my house and returned and sat with me, about an hour— From the tenour of his conversation I infer that his instructions are to preserve peace at all hazards— That he will in no event interpose any objection to the annexation of Texas, but will rather favour it— That he will come to another evasive compromise about the surrender of fugitive slaves— That he will be quite conciliatory upon the Oregon controversy leaving something unsettled and yielding as much as may be necessary to appease the South, reserving his victory for the demolition of the tariff and free trade— This afternoon I attended church at St. John’s Church where Mr Hawley, read the evening service for Easter—and half the Easter day Homily, for a Sermon— "

Mr Walter Forward of Pittsburgh called on me this morning, deeply concerned, and anxiously adverse, as I had found him last November at Pittsburgh against the annexation of Texas to this Union— To his enquiries as to the prospects of this event at present I could give no answer—though I now see it doomed beyond the reach of all but almighty power, and despair of that— The impulse of national aggrandizement, spurred by private avarice and corruption cannot be resisted; and it will now be consummated even without a War—with the connivance, if not with the aid of England. Morning visits also from Mr John W. Allen of Cleveland Ohio, a member of the 26th. Congress, and with him, Mr Williams and Mr Turner of that State.— At the house immediately after the reading of the journal John B. Weller of Ohio, rose with a sanctimonious face and announced the decease of his colleague Heman Allen Moore of Columbus who reached home merely to die on the 3d of this month— Weller’s obituary was pious, cold and heartless, with a string of commonplace quotations from scripture, and Burke’s what shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue— The usual mortuary resolutions were adopted, and the house adjourned— Professor Bache was at the side of my seat, and went with me to the Unitarian Church; where after a short prayer from Mr Bulfinch the Pastor, I took the chair, and presided at the ninth Meeting of the National Institute—about four hours— I read an address about five minutes long, which I had written this morning, apologising for my non attendance at the morning meetings of the last week, and expressing my regret at the very little service I have been able to render to the Institute— If the last week had been my own, and I could have lengthened this address to half an hour, I should have given satisfaction— Several papers were read on various topics and of various merit— A Letter from Levi Woodbury in favour of the Institute—a long one from Richard Rush, on the Smithsonian bequest—something from Professor Espy about storms, and lastly a Treatise by the President’s son John Tyler junr. on the controverted theories of single and double-electricity—very creditable to him— Near four O’Clock the meeting adjourned— And at half past 7 in the evening I attended the tenth and last meeting. J. C. Spencer presided and delivered a short closing address— Professor Patterson and A. H. Everett were the last performers. Dr Thomas came home with me. "

Mr Lambden is a painter usually residing at Philadelphia, who two or three years ago painted a portrait of me, and from whom I have not since heard till this morning, when he called on me, and requested me, to sit for him again— He has the portrait still, and says it has been much approved as a likeness, by all persons acquainted with me who have seen it— He has made a copy of it, which he intends to present to the astronomical Society of Cincinnati and wishes me to give him one or two sittings for finishing touches to the present time. I agreed to meet him to-morrow morning at 10 O’Clock at his room in the capitol. On my way to the house I stop’d at the Globe Office, and gave directions to the compositor Haliday for the printing of the Reports on the Massachusetts Resolves— I spoke for 100 extra copies of mine—and gave directions for the printing of the whole. The original manuscript of the journal in Joseph R. Ingersoll was not there; having been retained by B. B. French, supposing that my copy of it would be sufficient for the printing— But I directed, that the print should be from the original journal, and afterwards in the house, French promised me to send it to the printing Office— I found the house in Session; and taking the yeas and nays on a motion to reconsider a vote of yesterday, rejecting a proposal of the Committee on the public buildings to appropriate 1000 dollars from the contingent fund of the house and authorise the clerk to contract for illuminating the hall with the Drummond light. I did not reach my Seat in time to vote but the reconsideration was refused— Sundry reports from Committees were received, among which were two by Simons chairman of the Committee on engraving—proposing the engraving; in debate upon which Cave Johnson moved to abolish the office of meteorologist in the department of Surgeon general— This dislocation of professor Espy was rejected by yeas and nays. 79 to 86— M’Kay according to notice long since given moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the tariff Bill; but lost the motion by yeas and nays 80 to 84. Tibbatts then moved a resolution to cease debate in committee of the whole on the Eastern harbour bill at 4 O’Clock this afternoon; but this sprung a debate of two hours in which I took part and which closed by laying Tibbatts’s resolution on the table.— Elmer then moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and the Eastern harbour Bill was taken up— Davis of Indiana in the Chair— Small progress was made; the Committee rose and the house adjourned. At the National Intelligencer Office I met Jacob Barker. "

Sickly and destitute, but I have not the means of relieving him— I promised to take out of the Congress library for him the life of Beethoven the musical performer; but forgot to perform my promise— At 10 O’Clock I repaired to the Capitol and gave a sitting of an hour to Mr Lambden— His former portrait was there, and is one of the strongest likenesses that has ever been taken of me. He has also likenesses of President Tyler, W. Wilkins and the Senators Mangum of North-Carolina, and Morehead of Kentucky.— When I went into the house I found William J. Brown, of Indianapolis, one of the demi-demons of democracy which make a pandemonium of the house closing, under the guise of a personal explanation a renewed furious charge against Henry Clay of having said in one of his speeches that there was no need of protection— He had made the same charge one day last week, and it had been taken up, and convicted of forgery by John White of Kentucky— He had then been compelled to retract the charge, and to apologize for it— But he had now got another Report of a Speech of Clay, in which he said there was no need of protection for protection; and upon this he had the impudence to renew the charge and to rail like a maniac against Clay— White claimed the right to reply—and carried it by suspension of the rules; and again floored Brown, till he gasped for breath, convicted him of rascally slander, and left not a rag of reputation upon his back— But no man thinks the worse of Brown for this sample of his character and he will be ready to do his dirty work again to morrow, as if nothing had happened— Reports form Committees were then received and four were made by Charles J. Ingersoll from the Committee of foreign Affairs— One of these was a slave tainted sacrifice to the claim of the Spanish Minister of indemnity for the Amistad— Another against all political intercourse with Hayti— Ingersoll moved to print ten thousand extra copies of the Amistad Report— Dromgoole moved to go in to Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the Tariff-bill—lost by yeas and nays 85 to 87. Joseph R. Ingersoll moved to suspend the rules for a resolution to postpone the tariff bill till the last Tuesday in December next— Call of the house— Dromgoole moved to strike out next December and insert tomorrow lost 90 to 92. Joseph R. Ingersoll’s motion lost 83 to 100.— Message from the President on the Rhode-Island Insurrection— Referred to the select Committee of 5—adjourned at half past 4. "

He dined with us this day and is to return to Philadelphia to-morrow; with an order assigning Boston for his station as purser— This morning the Revd. R. R. Gurley called on me with the Revd. Aaron Foster, from whom I had received a queer letter on the 24th. of last October the day before I left Quincy for Cincinnati. He came now with a small Album, blank excepting a creed in half a dozen lines that Permanent and universal peace is the genius of Christianity and promotive of the prosperity of Nations and claims the prayers and exertions of all philanthropists He wished my name as first subscriber to this creed. I reinforced the creed by declaring peace the Law of Nature and of Nature’s God—the vital spirit and genius of Christianity, and essential to the Liberty, Justice and Prosperity of Nations— I subscribed to this, and left him to find other subscribe as he as he may. Mr Wethered and MrWinder came with several Letters and documents and a request that I would present to Congress the camp chest of Washington—a very unwelcome task, but which I do not see how I can decline it. I had promised to give a sitting of an hour, at ten this morning to Mr Gibert to paint my portrait; but these visitors had absorbed the time. At the house Tibbatts again moved to suspend the rules for a Resolution to cease debate on the eastern harbour Bill in committee of the whole on the state of the Union, at two O’Clock this afternoon, and then to take the question on all proposed amendments and report the bill to the house. And now he succeeded. The house went into Committee of the whole. John W. Davis in the Chair, and the whole time till 2 was consumed in debating an amendment proposed by Charles Rogers of Sandy-hill 14th. Congressional district of New-York—an appropriation of 5000 dollars for the harbour of Whitehall—which was carried 76 to 73. a succession of amendments were then voted up or down and the bill was reported to the house— There Thompson of Mississippi moved an additional appropriation, the bill was postponed, and the house went again into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union Linn Boyd in the chair and took up the amendments of the Senate, to the Revolutionary Pension bill.— The amendments of the Senate were adopted, amended or rejected and reported to the house, where they were further discussed and decided— A ludicrous altercation about skulking arose between Cave Johnson and Holmes— Adjourned near 5.

Dr Todsen had called upon me yesterday morning for the life of Beethoven, which I had promised the day before to take out of the Congress Library for him; but I had forgotten it, and asked him to call again this morning— Yesterday, I took the books out—two small volumes duo decimo, which I gave to the Doctor this morning, with a note of the librarian, that they must be returned by the 18th. instt.— I looked over the volumes cursorily—enough to see that he was unfortunate through life by the mere roughness of his temper.— I revised this morning the remainder of my report on the Resolves of the Massachusetts Legislature; and returned the proof with the manuscript to Mr Haliday— Ordering 100 extra copies to be sent and delivered at my seat in the house— I sat an hour to Mr Lambden who has finished the copy of his former portrait of me, and is now finishing a smaller copy, from which he proposes to having an engraving made. At the request of J. M. Edwards and Anthony, I sat also in their room while they took three larger Daguerrotype likenesses of me, than those they had taken before. While I was there President Tyler and his son John came in, but I did not notice them— The house had been half an hour in Session when I entered it and after an ineffectual attempt of Weller to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union sundry reports from Committees were received among which was one from Zadok Pratt, chairman of the Committee on the public buildings, glancing at an appropriation, to purchase from the funds received at the patent office, books for the use of the office; and another joint resolution with an appropriation for various purposes— It raised a running debate which closed by recommitting the Resolution. A. Stewart from the Committee on the District of Columbia reported without amendment a bill to incorporate the Georgetown College— Charles J. Ingersoll started an objection to it which raised a debate— I urged a recommitment of it, to save it— Committed to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. The house went into that Committee for one hour, and carried through Parmenter’s small navy appropriation, which also passed the house— Then came the private character-bounties, for perished fishing schooners. The copy-right and the use of the plates for the narratives of the exploring expetition, much debated, and finally postponed till next Friday. Dr Duncan moved to adjourn over to Monday, for the opportunity to witness to morrow the submarine explosion—but it failed—adjourned after 4. Large Evening party at Mrs Madison’s.

Saturday—  I received last evening, a petition to the house of Representatives from Alanson Bills, of Indiana County, Pennsylvania, bitterly complaining that he had heretofore sent me a petition to present, claiming remuneration for public services rendered by him in the revolutionary war, and that it appeared I had, totally neglected my duty, and never presented his petition— I found on consulting my minutes, that I presented his petition, on the 27th. of March, and it was referred to the Committee of Revolutionary pensions—and it was published as N. 159. in my list in the National Intelligencer of the 5th instt. I give this as a sample of the treatment to which members of Congress are not unfrequently subject from Petitioners— The sheet of the journal including the 27th of March is not yet printed— I gave the last sitting of a full hour this morning to Mr Lambden, who finished his third and last portrait of me— He asked me also to stop on Monday morning at Haas’s Daguerrotipe shop, and having a likeness of me taken there for him to which I agreed— It was about noon when I entered the house, and found it in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Weller in the Chair, upon the army appropriation bill. A call on the Secretary of the Navy had been adopted on motion of Mr Summers for correspondence of Commodore M C. Perry, commander of the squadron on the coast of Africa, concerning the coloured colonies there— Vance and Ramsay, had pleaded in vain for the regular order of private business— The army appropriation bill prevailed, and the effort of M’Kay, chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means was to reduce the amount of the appropriations, to square with the reductions—of the retrenchment bill recently passed for regulating the pay of the army.— The army supporters, chiefly whigs, Barnard, White, Joseph R. Ingersoll were urging that the appropriations should be left as if the retrenchment bill had not passed— Brengle however a new whig member from Maryland was in favour of the reduction, and Archibald Atkinson of the first Congressional District of Virginia voided a hogshead of invective upon the whigs, and charged them among many other things with now claiming for themselves the merit of the retrenchments made by the 27th. Congress; but which were carried against their votes— Morse of Maine replied to Atkinson by a defence of the whigs, but soon after two, he gave way to a motion for the Committee to rise and the house adjourned— I went down to the Eastern branch and saw the experiment of blowing up by submarine explosion a ship of 500 tons, under weigh— Daniel R. Goodloe, and John Connell were here. "

Midsummer heat— Trees in full blossom  Notice had been given yesterday in the daily Journals that Mr Tinsley the chaplain of the house of Representatives, would this day at the request of the friends of the late Heman Allen Moore, deliver a funeral discourse upon his decease— The hall was well filled, in the expectation of hearing him, but Mr Tustin, the chaplain to the Senate informed the auditory that Mr Tinsley had been taken ill, and from indisposition was unable to attend. The Revd James A Roberts of New-Bedford made the prayer, and Mr Tustin himself preached a sermon of an hour, from John 5.40. “And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.” A variation from the ordinary grammatical construction of the sentence which should be that ye may have life— This chapter contains the account of the man healed at the pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath day, a circumstance excessively offensive to the Jews at Jerusalem—whereupon Jesus thus expostulated with them— Toward the close of his discourse Mr Tustin involved himself in a labyrinth of discussion to reconcile free will and predestination, which he was quite unable to adjust— Immediately after dinner I received visits from the Minister of Great Britain Mr Pakenham, and his Secretary Mr Bidwell— With Mr Pakenham I had some conversation— I enquired if his negotiation with our Government on the subject of the Oregon territory had commenced. He said it had not.— But he said that he had made an explicit declaration to our Department of State that the British Government would in no respect interfere in the affairs of Texas; and he spoke of it as some what extraordinary that the fact had been publicly denied in the Madisonian, the official daily journal of the Executive— He said he had thought of addressing a note to the Secretary of State on the subject. But he manifested no feeling on the signature of the Treaty for the annexation of Texas to the United States, and left me with the impression that Great Britain would oppose no resistance to its consummation— I attended public worship this afternoon at the second Presbyterian Church where Mr Knox preached from 1. Timothy 2.5 “For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” The necessity of a mediation by God, between God and man, for the salvation of men is like predestination and free will; hard to be understood.— Mr David L. Child was here this Evening. He says there will be War with Mexico— I doubt— "

V:15 Monday  Early this morning Harriet Livermore made her appearance here for the fourth time within the last twenty years, with a book which within the last six months, she has published at a cost of nearly 200 dollars, and for which there is no sale; and with a manuscript to publish which she comes to solicit subscriptions.— And while she is spending money profusely to print books which no body will purchase or read, she is so totally destitute that last Christmas day in New-York she had only three borrowed potatoes and half an ounce of dry bread for nourishment, and threw herself on a bed to die of hunger unless relieved by the special interposition of God—which came in the person of a female acquaintance who ministered to her wants— She breakfasted with us, and I took her printed book, and subscribed for the printing of the manuscript, giving her a five dollar bill for the whole— But I dissuaded her from printing the manuscript, and declined drawing up a subscription paper for her, as she requested. She told me she wished to preach in the Hall of the House of Representatives next Sunday, and I promised to aid in obtaining for her the permission. Mr William Darby was here to discourse concerning his payment of half a year’s rent for the house of which he has a lease from me—but he prevaricated so that I could only refer him to Mr Frye— Mr William S. Hubbell of the 30th. Congressional District of New-York, came and introduced to me a namesake of his of Canandaigua, and a Revd. Mr Eddy of New Jersey; and the Revd. Aaron Foster was with them— I had about half an hour’s conversation with them—chiefly concerning the recent revolution in the city Government of New-York—accomplished for reform; and which I greatly fear will itself as urgently need reform before the end of the year— At the house this was the day for the call of petitions, but not a petition was suffered to be presented— There was a call of the house long protracted, which produced only 173 answers of names. M’Kay moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the tariff bill—lost 84 to 95—but they went in to Committee, Weller in the Chair and took up the army appropriation bill.— Morse finished his partisan Speech—at 2. O’Clock the time came for taking it out of Committee. It was reported to the house with amendments—one of which an appropriation for a purchase of land at Newport Kentucky was rejected by yeas and nays 58 to 96 after which the bill passed to be engrossed, and passed— And at 4. O’Clock the house adjourned— "

IV:45 Tuesday  Fahrenheit over 80  Dr Todsen called this morning, and returned the 2 Volumes of the Life of Beethoven which I had taken for him at the Library of Congress. He expressed a desire to see one or two volumes of Dupuis’s Origine de tous les cultes, which I promised to take for him from the library if they are there— Mrs Telfair came again to complain of the neglect or indifference of the committee on revolutionary claims to her claims, and to ask my advice, which can be of no avail to soften the obduracy of Richard D. Davis the chairman of that committee. At the house, Cranston presented by leave the protest of the Legislature of Rhode-Island, against the right of Congress to interfere in the internal affairs of that State— And just as he was presenting it, his colleague Elisha R. Potter went to him and asked him to tack to the protest a newspaper slip, on which were printed the message of the Governor of Rhode-Island to the Legislature, and the vote of censure by the Legislature upon the members, who signed the memorial upon which Burke raised his select Committee— The protest when presented by Cranston was ordered to be laid on the table and printed. Some time after Burke, going to the clerk’s table to examine the protest, found the newspaper slip tacked to it; and raised a tempest in a teapot, charging it as a fraud and imposition upon the house practised by the Rhode-Island members. Burke grossly insulted them; and the bulldogs of the democracy were all out upon them— Some of the whig members sustained them as well as they could, and they made a rather aukward apology— Weller moved to reconsider the order to lay on the table and print the protest— It was reconsidered. Potter then withdrew the newspaper slip, much against the will of Payne, and other of the rabid animals, who denied their right to withdraw their supplementary paper—but the Speaker decided that they had the right. The order to lay on the table and print the protest was then renewed, but they took the question of printing by yeas and nays. Five minutes after Burke smuggled in a protest against the protesters which was laid on the table and ordered to be printed much in the same snarl as the rest. Causin made on the question to print the protest an eloquent and sound speech against the whole proceedings of the house on the subject— The rest of the day was consumed in discussing the reconsideration of a vote yesterday refusing an appropriation for a purchase of land in Newport Kentucky— The reconsideration was at last denied— Dr Thomas here this evening, to see my wife.

The more than midsummer heat, that has continued so unseasonably long, has at last partially subsided, and the temperature of Spring with dewy fingers cold, has taken place of the premature dog-days— My sleep of last Night was not quiet, and I first rose this morning before three— Then returned to bed without sleep and up again at daylight— I wrote to John J. Flournoy of Georgia, returning to him a petition to the Legislature of Georgia which he had sent to me to present to the House of Representatives of the United States— I had promised at his earnest solicitation to present a petition for him to the house, and he sent me the petition to the Legislature of Georgia—authorizing me by Letter to change its direction—and address it to the house— If I should do it, they would charge it upon me as forgery— Flournoy is a crack-brained Christian Slaveholder, who believes that African Slavery is sanctioned by the curse upon Canaan— At the house, Weller presented a memorial and the proceedings of a convention in this city concerning an amendment of the city charter.— Laid on the table and ordered to be printed— I presented by leave the memorial of Eliphalet Nott, B. F. Butler and other learned and literary men, who attended the late Anniversary of the National Institute, in aid of the Memorial recently presented from the Institute, praying for an appropriation for its support— I had presented the memorial of the Institute, and moved its reference to the joint Committee on the library. Objection had then been made by a single member, and the question of reference laid over But French had considered it as entered under the rule, and sent the memorial to the Library Committee on his own authority. The auxiliary memorial presented by me this day was received and referred without objection.— Numerous Reports of Committees were received almost all pernicious— The Western harbour Bill was taken up, and the previous question was withdrawn, for the homunculus Douglass to poke out a speech in favour of the constitutionality of appropriations for the improvement of Western rivers and harbours.— This brought out Rhett in all his fury and Holmes in all his casuistry, against Douglass and against the whole system of Internal improvement, federalism, consolidation and despotism— The debate was continued between the conflicting absurdities of the Southern Democracy which is Slavery and the Western democracy which is knavery, till Kennedy of Indiana slumped into a motion to strike out the whole bill, and inserting the bill first reported by the Committee omitting the Illinois river. Hopkins Quasi speaker pronounced this not in order. Kennedy appealed. Adjourned. "

Macy of Cincinnati, one of my fellow travellers from the 1st. to the 4th of last November in the Canal-boat from Cleveland to Hebron— He came with a Son of Mr Tallmadge the Senator from New-York and spent part of last evening with me. This morning Miss Harriet Livermore came again and breakfasted with us. She has obtained Mr Tinsley’s consent to preach in the hall of the house next Sunday morning at 11. He wished her to take the afternoon at 4. O’Clock but she declined— She was opening to me this morning for advice a very long and complicated story of her claim upon her deceased father’s estate, in controversy with her stepmother but with which I have no right to interfere— We were interrupted by a visit, from Mrs Royall’s Sally, from which I was relieved for a dollar— And I hope it relieved me also from all further cognisance of Miss Livermore’s family concerns.— I was all the time, labouring with preparation for the ceremony of presenting to the house and thereby to Congress, in the name of the late William Sidney Winder, the camp chest of General George Washington used by him during the revolutionary War— There are circumstances of deep feeling in this transaction susceptible of being most invidiously turned against me, and to give an aukward and perhaps ridiculous aspect to the whole proceeding.— There was a Letter from General Washington, refering to the furniture of this chest, which after long and anxious search, I found at the National Intelligencer Office in Niles Register of 13. May 1843.— By agreement with the Speaker, immediately after the reading of the house I stated that I had this chest to present, and proposed that 3. O’Clock P.M. this day should be fixed for the operation—to which the house assented— In the interval the morning hour was consumed by a speech of Giddings against a motion of Charles J. Ingersoll to print ten thousand extra copies of a report by him as chairman of the Committee of foreign affairs in the case of the Amistad.— The house then took up the western river and harbour bill, and I retired to the chamber of the Committee of Manufacturers, and wrote till close upon three. Then returned to the house, where they had just rejected the engrossment of the harbour Bill—and Duncan had moved a reconsideration— Precisely at 3 O’Clock I presented the camp-chest with the documents my vouchers for offering it, and an address, not more than five minutes in length, and offered a joint Resolution accepting the chest, and another of respect and sympathy to the family— Mr Wethered and J. P. Kennedy followed with a few words.— "

Hale, who upon the question of each Resolution distinctly answered no— The house then at the motion of John P. Kennedy adjourned— Mary Cutts and my grand daughter Mary Louisa had been in the Lady’s gallery and were in the barouche at the door of the house— I came home with them and Miss Cutts dined with us— Mrs Madison with her niece Anna Payne was in the house sitting in front of the Clerk’s table during the whole ceremony— This morning Mr Hubbell the member of the house from the 30th Congressional District of New-York Steuben and Allegany came with General Davis, Speaker of the present or late house of Assembly of that State whom he introduced to me— At the house, I presented by leave the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts concerning the annexation of Texas oflast—and moved that they be laid on the table and printed— Cave Johnson and Weller made a show of objection to the reception of them, but did not persist— Charles J. Ingersoll, made an attempt to have them referred to his Committee of foreign Affairs, but the Speaker declared his motion not in order.— The first business of the day was the question was upon the motion to print ten thousand copies of Charles Hudson’s report from the Committee of Manufacturers, with Charles J. Ingersoll’s amendment to print 10000 copies of his report from the Committee of foreign Affairs—in the case of the Amistad— Preston King said he would move the indefinite postponement of the subject—but Weller moved to lay the whole subject on the table which was carried by yeas and nays 86 to 62— Giddings’s hour speech of yesterday, had sickened the democracy of Ingersoll’s report— I had not read it— The only private business transacted was a joint Resolution for the relief of W. P. Zantzinger a purser in the Navy passed rather hastily and with a refusal to reconsider.— A bill to authorise an extra Session of the Legislature of Iowa was passed, and after the usual routine of interloping, the Western Harbour Bill was taken up and Duncan moved the previous question—on his motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday, while I was out, refusing the engrossment of the Bill for a third reading— The vote of reconsideration was carried by yeas and nays 129 to 40. and the whole bill was reopened for debate— Duncan moved to strike out the Illinois river, and a long debate ensued till past 4 when the house adjourned.

I had an hour of conversation with them— They are the Undertakers and preceptors of a high school in this city, for young gentlemen, of which they sent me a few days since the prospectus— They have built a school house within three doors of my dwelling house, and propose about the first of next month to open it with something of an imposing solemnity. They sent me a very flattering invitation to preside on that occasion and to deliver an address upon the nature and objects of this institution— I could not accept it— I am unfitted for all public exhibitions of myself in person henceforth and forever— Mr Girault is a Frenchman and spoke with much sensibility of the recent decease of Stephen S Du Ponceau; and with good sense of Robert Walsh who vegetates at Paris on a pension of 1500 dollars a year paid him by Gales and Seaton, for an Olla Podrida of weekly gossiping Letters, about Literature and Politics Irish repeal, English Corn Laws, Louis Philippe and the Duke de Bordeaux.— At the house John Wentworth of Illinois made a personal explanation; assuring the house that he did not use the words By God! yesterday, as reported in the Intelligencer; but only exclaimed, My God! an exclamation of deep sensibility, but in no sense or intention of using profane language. Alexander H. Stephens, presented Resolutions of the Legislature of Georgia, in answer and adverse to those of the Legislature of Massachusetts proposing the amendment to the Constitution— He moved to refer them to a select Committee of 9—but Cave Johnson moved that they be laid on the table, and printed, which was carried— Then followed sundry reports of Committees, of no significance— A Bill for repairing the Pennsylvania avenue— Motion to lay on the table, lost 74 to 83.— M’Kay moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the Navy or Post office appropriation bills—lost 88 to 91. Vance pleaded very hard for the private Calendar—but M’Clernand moved to go into Commee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the Western harbour bill, and that prevailed, 120 to 59— Tibbatts concluded his dull speech in support of the Bill— John R. J. Daniel of Halifax North-Carolina railed for an hour against internal improvement, and Alvan Cullom of Livingston 4th. District of Tennessee founded the same base string— The Illinois river was struck out 118 to 49. for fear of a Veto— The bill then passed to be engrossed by yeas 110 to 75—and finally passed 108 to 72.— Duncan moved a reconsideration— No quorum voting— Adjourned.

Rain—great part of the Night; followed by a dark, gloomy day— I had obtained from Mr Tinsley, with some reluctance on his part, the permission for Harriet Livermore to preach in the Hall of the House of Representatives, this morning and I went with my Granddaughter Mary-Louisa and heard her She was alone, and had the appearance of being solitary and desolate. She complained of being weak, and of having been obliged to walk from her lodgings to the Hall— She read the 35th. and part of the 36th. chapter of Job, and took for her text Isaiah 55.6. “Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. 7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways, my ways saith the Lord— 9. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways, higher than your ways, and my thoughts, than your thoughts. 10. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow, from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; 11. So shall my word be, that goeth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me, void; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”— The discourse of an hour and a quarter was a commination of the judgments of God upon us as a sinful nation. It was a denunciation of the crimes of the age, with a multitude of awful threatenings to the careless, impenitent—not however so impressive as it had been when she preached here seven years ago. She is older, weaker, and is in no wise, more pleasing— Her mental hallucination has continued near forty years— She has not found followers to form a sect— She has met no encouragement from the world; but is as immovably fixed in her monomania, as when it first came upon her 35 years ago. After dinner I attended at St. Johns Church where Mr Pine read the evening service for the second Sunday after Easter and preached from 1. Corinthians 15.37. “And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: 38. But god giveth it a body, as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.” From this text Mr Pine deduced the doctrine of salvation by Faith in Jesus Christ— His sermon was well written and well delivered— Joseph R. Ingersoll told me his name "

My old serving man, and afterwards butler and steward Antoine called on me this morning with a Letter to his agent for taking care of his land purchases in the territory of Wiskonsin— Thirty years have passed away since Antoine, then a Piedmontese deserter from the army of Napoleon in his Russian Campaign, entered my service at Amsterdam— He was fifteen years in my service— Fifteen more have passed since he left me— I seldom see him— He says it always agitates his nerves when he comes to see me. How many recollections crowd upon my soul, when I see him! and what are to be the feelings of my last days and hours? This was a memorable day in the annals of the world— The Treaty for the annexation of Texas to this Union was this day sent in to the Senate; and with it the freedom of the human race— In the house it was a no less disastrous day. M’Kay chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means made his long fore-announced motion to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up his anti-tariff bill; and after a call of the house upon which 194 members answered to their names, the motion was carried by a vote of 104 to 94. the majority consisting of that floating class of Janus-faces, who decide all great and critical questions, by holding themselves at market till the last hour, and then let the hammer fall to the highest bidder.— The vote against reconsidering the passage of the Western harbour bill had been 73 to 111— The number voting on the motion to take up the anti tariff was 198. probably the largest vote of the Session— The standing supremacy of the Slave representation is 112 a bare majority of the whole house consisting of 80 Slaveholders and 32 free trade auxiliaries— This is the average allowing 8 Slaveholders for occasional defection from their iron rule, and an equal number of Laodicean freeman neither hot nor cold, and ever wavering between Slavery and Freedom— This day the Speaker put G. W. Hopkins in the Chair and no sooner was the bill read than Charles J. Ingersoll started to take the lead of this whole movement by moving to strike out the 1st. of September, and inserting the 1st. of January next for the beginning of the new tariff— At the very same time Robert Dale Owen the Scotch Atheist had a diabetic hour speech against the Tariff, and the English corn laws and paupers, by heart; and could not restrain himself from letting it off— There was a long debate whether upon the petty question to change the day for the bill to commence, the whole tariff controversy could be discussed— Ingersoll’s motion was at last rejected, and Robert Dale, went through his hour without brequent, he willily lying it over till the next Presidential Canvas shall be settled— Wright followed for half an hour and then moved the Committee to rise, and the house adjourned— Cave Johnson moved to meet at 10. A.M—lost. "

I answered the Letter of Julius Pratt and Co of Meriden, Connecticut which accompanied their present of an ivory cane to me— I answered also the Letter of Henry L. Ellsworth, Commissioner of Pensions, with which he delivered the cane to me— I took these Letters, together with a copy of the Letter from Pratt and Co. and the cane, leaving them all with Mr Ellsworth, the cane to be kept in custody of the Commissioner, among the curiosities of the Office, until the right of petition shall be restored by the extinction of the gag-rule in the house of Representatives— The donors of the cane request me when that event shall occur to have the date of it added to the motto held by the eagle on the top of the cane— In depositing the cane at the patent office, I reserved to myself and my legal representatives the right to borrow it hereafter to have the date added to the motto, when the fact shall be realized, and then that the cane be finally deposited in the Office— Mr Goodwin of Hartford was at the Office with Mr. Ellsworth, who promised to forward my Letter to Pratt and Co. and to keep the cane safely— At the house, after the reading of the journal there was no Quorum— Hopkins moved a Call, which was commenced, but soon superseded as the members came in. Mr Pollock, the member from Pennsylvania, replacing the late Henry Frick was sworn in and took his seat— The house immediately went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, G. W. Hopkins in the Chair on the Tariff bill.— Joseph A. Wright of Indiana, concluded an agricultural hour speech against the existing Tariff of 1842. and in favour of the present bill— John White of Kentucky then took the floor and consumed his hour in discoursing, not upon the tariff but in defence of Henry Clay against a base concerted attack of Lynn Boyd, George W. Hopkins and Walter Coles, in the Newspapers reviving the old lying accusation of a bargain between him and me for my appointment of him as Secretary of State, for his vote in my favour as President— After refuting this charge, White was passing to another ridiculous imputation the git of which was that Clay in a speech upon the Missouri question had spoken of black slaves and white slaves— The hour expired. White pleaded hard for another hour; but the house would not indulge him and he had so exasperated the ruling party, by driving them from their battery of Slander, that one of them George Rathbun, sitting near where he spoke, started up and in a transport of rage turned upon him and struck him—a short fight ensued—a rush of members over the tables and chairs to part them— The Speaker took the chair— A pistol ball was fired at M’Causland a member, by a Kentuckian named Moore whom he was turning out of the hall— The ball missed him, but passed through the door, and wounded an Officer of the police named Wirt— Then 3 hours of debate a select committee of 5 to investigate, and adjourned.

Before the reconciliation took place yesterday between the parties to the fray in the house, I had risen, and requested Dromgoole to withdraw his motion that the Sergeant at arms should take the two members into custody, for a motion which I proposed to make for the appointment of a select committee of investigation according to the precedent in the case of the fray between Wise and Stanley— But Romulus M. Saunders took the floor from me, for the same identical proposition; and after the reconciliation I thought there was no farther occasion for a Committee— The party majority however clung to the appointment and carried it, of a Select Committee of five—Saunders, myself, Dromgoole, Reuben Chapman, and Hardin of Illinois— The selection of the 3 Slavemongers was a sufficient indication of the use to be made of this Committee— Saunders notified them to meet in the room of the judiciary committee immediately after the adjournment of the house— Having heard that General Almonte the Mexican Minister was to depart to-morrow for New-York with his family to-morrow, I called at his house and took leave of him— I told him that I had received several applications in behalf of individuals my countrymen, prisoners at Perote, taken at Mier, with intreaties that I would solicit President Santa Anna for their release— That under present circumstances I could not justify myself for such interposition; but I still hoped he would return from New-York to this city, and that the Peace between our Countries would be preserved, and in that event would speak further with him on this subject— This morning, Andrew Kennedy and John White asked a suspension of the rules to enable them to make personal explanations in refutation of misstatements in the Globe— The vote for suspension was 98 to 64 not two thirds— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, first Weller and then Hopkins in the Chair.— Jacob Brinkerhoff of Mansfield 11th. Congressional District of Ohio made an hour anti-tariff speech— Wethered and John P. Kennedy, Edward Joy Morris and Washington Hunt Tariff speeches till half past 4 when the committee rose and the house adjourned— The select Committee met in the room of the judiciary Committee. I found immediately that Saunders, Dromgoole and Chapman were intent upon turning this quarrel into a party engine, and gave notice that I should not attend the meeting of the Committee to morrow morning, and should ask to be excused by the house from further service on the Committee— I gave a sitting of an hour to Mr Gibert to paint my Portrait— Mr and Mrs Milton Brown, and General Jones of Tennessee and his daughter visited us this evening.

Dr Laurie called on me this morning for an answer to a Letter that I had received from him soliciting my interposition with the Mexican President Santa Anna to obtain the release of Dr William M. Shepherd a nephew of his wife, captured as a Texian Prisoner at Mier and now confined in the Castle at Perote— I answered him as I had answered Mr Breese yesterday that it would give me great pleasure to contribute all in my power to obtain the release of the prisoner; but that in the present state of our relations with Mexico, I could ask no personal favour of President Santa Anna. At the house, immediately after the reading of the journal, I requested to be excused from serving upon the select committee on the quarrel between Rathbun and White.— And to be excused also from assigning my reasons for the request— I said I might by the rules of the house release myself from the service; being a member of two other Committees. But I preferred to be discharged from this Committee by authority of the house. And as the Committee would probably have occasion to sit this day and to-morrow, I wished that another member might be appointed to supply my place. The Speaker put the question and I was excused, without a negative voice. John Slidell of New-Orleans then rose and announced the death of Pierre Evariste Bossier a member from Louisiana of consumption, last evening at his lodgings in this city— Slidell pronounced a genteel eulogy upon him larded with latin and french proverbs and crowned him with a chaplet of French Creole virtues. He offered the usual sympathising resolutions, to wear crape, to attend the funeral to-morrow at Noon, and to adjourn—which were adopted without further notice— I went into the Senate chamber and had my answer to Mr Breese delivered to him— The Message came in from the house announcing the death of Mr Bossier— Henry Johnson after premising that the deceased possessed all the fine qualities for which the Creoles were so eminently distinguished offered the usual resolutions, forgetting the one to attend the funeral which was however supplied at the suggestion of Benjamin Tappan of Ohio— They were adopted and the Senate adjourned— I spoke to Mr Crittenden who said Mr Clay would be here to-morrow and his Letter on Texas would be published in the National Intelligencer Saturday morning. I sat an hour for my picture to Gibert— Called at the Office of the National Intelligencer, where Gales told me they had not yet received the Letter from Mr Clay. Evening visits from Mr Thom—and from Messrs Saltonstall, Stanley and Kinnicutt. "

Friday  Mr Von Raumer and his Son, are Travellers from Berlin—Prussia— They come with an open Letter of recommendation from Henry Wheaton, the Minister of the United States at Berlin, addressed to perhaps 30 individual public men in the several States of this Union and among the rest to me— The Letter is endorsed or countersigned by Edward Everett at London, about the first of this month. Mr Von Raumer has already published a book of travels in European countries, said to be in high repute but of which I had never heard— He comes now, to travel in this country and then publish another book of travels.— He called on me this morning, and in his conversation seemed to have his curiosity chiefly attracted to the subject of Slavery. I went to the Capitol before 11. and gave a sitting of an hour for my portrait to Gibert— While with him a man by the name of Fazio with a thick bushy beard came in, and remained till I came away.— He is the son of a Man formerly attached to the Spanish legation, and was at last Spanish Consul at New-Orleans where he died— At Noon I attended at the House of Representatives the funeral obsequies of Pierre Evariste Bossier, the late member of the house from Louisiana, which were performed according to the rites of the Roman Catholic church, and his profession of faith. There were seven romish ecclesiastics who took part in the ceremony, but the chief performer was the Revd Mr Ryder President of the Georgetown College; who pronounced the Latin prayers; went round the coffin, sprinkling it with holy water, shaking incense over it, and closing with a funeral discourse in English— His text was from 2. Maccabees 12.43. “And when he had made a gathering throughout the company to the sum of two thousand drachmas of silver, he sent it to Jerusalem to offer a sin offering, doing therein very well and honestly, in that he was mindful of the resurrection. 44 For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should have risen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead 45. And also in that he perceived that there was great favour laid up for those that died godly. (It was a holy and good thought—) Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might be delivered from sin.” The sermon was a controversial dissertation, upon the funeral rites of the Roman Catholic church— I rode to the grave-yard with Messrs Jenks, Dickey and Pollock, members of the house from Pennsylvania, and on returning they alighted at their lodgings— I went to the Hall where the Speaker took the Chair, and with two other members present adjourned the house—and I came home— I attended with Mrs John and Isaac Hull an evening party at Mr W. W. Seaton’s.— Canicular heat. "

S Smith left us and returned to Mr Frye’s last Thursday— From last Night to this morning a sudden and great change from high summer heat to a rain, chilly East wind with frequent showers took place;— Mr Henry Clay arrived in this city yesterday, on his way homeward from an extensive tour to the South as far as New-Orleans— In the National Intelligencer of this morning is published a Letter from him against the annexation of Texas at this time. Mr Giddings called on me and introduced to me one of his constituents named Ford, who comes as a delegate to the whig convention to be held at Baltimore next Wednesday to nominate Henry Clay, as the whig candidate for election to the office of President of the United States next December— The Delegates to that Convention, and to that of the Convention of young men to be held the succeeding day at the same place are already swarming here from all parts of the country. Among the rest Mr Gibson, the Mayor of Schenectady, who presided at the hospitable dinner which they gave me there last summer, called this morning with his friend a Mr Strong of Geneva, in that State— At the house Dromgoole moved a Resolution to cease debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the tariff bill on Monday, the 6th. of May, and take it into the house— Several of the whigs insisted that the time was too short— Charles J Ingersoll moved as an amendment Thursday the 9th. of May— Andrew Stewart moved to lay the Resolution on the table—carried by yeas and nays 88 to 83 Weller in a burst of passion said well—we will pass the bill next Wednesday. The motion to go now into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the Tariff bill was resisted, but without avail. D. D. Barnard made an effort to get up the Eastern harbour Bill but failed— The day was consumed in the dullest of hour speeches, with Hopkins in the chair, by James E Belser of Alabama, against the tariff, Richard Brodhead of Easton Pennsylvania for it, John Slidell of New-Orleans, on both sides, and Lewis Steenrod of Wheeling, Virginia, anti-tariff to the backbone— Four speeches, four hours— At half past four the Committee rose, and the house adjourned. I went to Gibert’s Room to sit an hour for my picture, but he was not there Among the strangers who called me out to shake hands with me this day was Mr Grattan, the British Consul at Boston— This evening we were delightfully surprized by the arrival of our Son from Boston, which he left the day before yesterday afternoon.— Martin van Buren’s Letter against the annexation of Texas at this time, was published this Evening in the Globe.

The Chaplain of the house, Mr Tinsley was there and set the tune for singing the hymns by two lines at a time; and I expected his long promised funeral discourse on Heman Allen Moore and the other members of Congress who have recently died; but instead of that, a Revd. Dr. M’Lean of New-York, said to be a Bible Society Missionary, preached with, I think the broadest Scottish accent that I ever heard, from John 17.20 [“]Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word:” and especially 21. [“]That they all may be one; as thou father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou has sent me—” This passage is from the awfully solemn discourse held by Jesus immediately before he was betrayed by Judas, and arrested for trial. The discourse is mysterious in the highest degree— In the chapter he repeated declares his unity with God the father—his own existence before the creation of the world and his own glorification, even by the crucifixion which he was about to suffer, a cup which he yet prayed might pass from him— I did not consider the Sermon appropriate to the time, or place; not yet specially adapted to promote the distribution of bibles— The auditory was unusually thin— Mr Tinsley brought the Revd. Dr to my seat, and introduced him to me. I met there my very old acquaintance Joseph Russell of Boston; and also the Revd Dr Francis Parkman, who dined with us, and whom we heard preach after dinner in the Unitarian Church— He gave out two texts—first Micah 6.8. “He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?— ” secondly—Mark 10.17. “And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running; and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?”— This was a warm and forcible exhortation to justice, mercy, and humility before God, which comprize the whole duty of man— In the evening we had visits from Mr Philip Hone of New-York and Timothy Child, member of the 26th. and 27th. Congresses from Rochester in that State. He told me that in the Globe of last evening there was published a Letter from Martin van Buren to William H. Hammet, a member of the House of Representatives from the State of Mississippi; declaring against the annexation of Texas to this Union at this time— We had also an evening visit from Mr John Connell.

Dixon H. Lewis offered a Resolution calling on the President for [“]copies of such portions of the correspondence, public or private, in the years 1816, 1817, 1818. 1819 and 1820, between our Ministers at the Court of Madrid, and the Department of State, between those Ministers and the Spanish Secretaries of State, and between the Department of State, and the Spanish Ministers accredited to this Government, and which correspondence may not have been hitherto communicated to either house of Congress, and published under the authority of either.— Provided however, that the President shall not deem it incompatible with the public interest to furnish the copies referred to—” Objections were made to receiving the resolution. Lewis moved to suspend the rules, for which I voted and which was carried 119 to 23 John W. Davis immediately moved the previous question. He withdrew it however at my request for me to move an amendment to strike out the proviso— Lewis after some resistance accepted the modification, and the Resolution was adopted without the proviso.— The house then went into committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the chair on the tariff bill— Weller, Alexander Ramsey of Harrisburg 14th. Congressional District of Pennsylvania, Jacob Collamer of Woodstock 2d. District of Vermont, Moses G. Leonard, of the city of New-York, and Abraham R. M’Ilvaine of Chester 7th. District of Pennsylvania, expatiated five hours pro and con for and against the tariff—with various merit— Collamer’s speech bearing off the palm for the day— I borrowed an hour for the sitting to Gibert for my portrait, and he said he would let me off with one sitting more— There were numerous visitors from all parts of the Union, delegates to the whigh conventions to be held at Baltimore on the 1st. and second of May were in the house— An attempt was made to force a night Session, which failed for want of a Quorum—and my objecting to do business without one "

Tuesday  Mr Henry Clay with his son, called yesterday at my house, and was received by my family, but I was not at home— This morning I called with my son at Mr William A. Bradley’s, where he lodges, and saw him— He looks much weather beaten, and is very hoarse but in good health and Spirits— At the house, they went almost immediately into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the state of the Union tariff bill, Hopkins in the chair, Albert Smith of New-York, closed an hour speech against the bill, and was followed by Linn Boyd of Kentucky who after a few words in favour of the bill, turned off to his new vamped old slander of a corrupt bargain between Henry Clay and me, that, he should be appointed Secretary of State on condition that he and the Kentucky delegation should vote for me as President of the United States.— Boyd used up his hour in replying to John White’s hour speech in vindication of Mr Clay against these charges— This stale and base columny, already abandoned and recanted by those who first invented and imposed upon the credulity of their partizans these men are now blowing the coals up to kindle again into a flame to consume Clay’s election hopes and my honest fame— Boyd closed his speech with another attack upon Clay for his vote in favour of the Bankrupt act of 1842. Caleb B. Smith came next with a strong hour speech in favour of the tariff— Preston King of New-York, with a shorter one against it. George P. Marsh of Vermont and Benjamin A. Bidlack continued the debate with high and low powers till past 5. O’Clock, when the Committee rose— John White moved to adjourn over to Friday, but failed by yeas and nays 59 to 68— I walked home, and then went and dined with the Austrian Charge d’Affaires Mr Hülzemann— A dinner party given to Mr Clay. My Son dined with Mr Grinnell— Mr Josiah Quincy junr was on the floor of the house this morning. "

Benton, all concurring in the injustice and impolicy of annexing Texas at this time to the United States have been published within the last five days, and the reading them has consumed so much time, that my diary runs again into arrears, and my head into confusion.— This was the day of the first whig convention at Baltimore to nominate Henry Clay as their candidate for the Office of President of the United States for four years from the fourth of March next, and to agree upon a Candidate for the Office of Vice President— They met accordingly 275 in number from the 26. States, equal to the Constitutional number of the two houses of Congress; and what never has happened in either house of Congress, the whole number from every State was present— Ambrose Spencer of New-York was President, and Henry Clay of Kentucky was unanimously nominated as their Candidate for President. At the fourth time of voting viva voce they fixed upon Theodore Frelinghuysen of New-Jersey as their Candidate for the Vice Presidency— Mr Connell called here this evening and gave us this information received from Baltimore by the Telegraph— I stop’d at Haas’s shop this morning at the request by Letter of Mr Lambden, to have a full length Daguerrotype likeness of me taken, to assist Mr Lambden to finish his Portrait of me— Haas was not ready for me this day, and I promised to call again to-morrow— At the house there was a motion pending to cease debate on the tariff bill and take it out of the Committee of the whole on Wednesday the 8th.— Dromgoole moved as an amendment to substitute Monday the 6th. lost by yeas and nays 23 to 101. The resolution was then adopted without a division.— This and the two following days had been assigned for the District business— But Campbell chairman of the District Committee is absent from indisposition and by general consent the first three Legislative days after closing the debate on the tariff were substituted instead of the present days. The tariff bill was further debated in Committee of the whole by Bidlack, Buffington, Hubard, Grinnell, Dunlap and Pollock till past 4— Cobb of Georgia took the floor—the Committee rose and the house adjourned— I gave the last sitting for my portrait to Gibert.

My son has been with us only four days, and I feel as if it were a final parting— Yet I cherish the hope that we shall meet again within two months at Quincy.— I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer and gave to Mr Gales a copy of Mrs Addicks’s newly published French grammar, and requested him in her behalf, to notice it on the Newspaper, which he promised to do. About a month has passed since I received from Mrs Addicks, a letter, with two copies of her book one as a present to me, and requesting me to deliver the other to the Editors of the Intelligencer, and she desired my opinion upon her book, and a puff from the Intelligencer— I neglected to answer her Letter, till yesterday there came a second Letter of more than female resentment, and reproach— It spurred me on to deliver the copy to the Editors of the Intelligencer— I stop’d next at Haas’s office, and he took one Daguerrotype likeness of me, for Mr Lambden but the day was dark and beclouded and the light was not propitious, and I promised if it should be better to morrow morning to call again— At the house there was a bare quorum to do business, without failure— Duncan moved a reconsideration of the vote assigning the first three legislative days after closing the debate on the tariff bill, to the business of the District of Columbia— But the debate on the question of reconsideration was postponed— The bill from the Senate for reducing the rates of Postage, limiting and regulating the franking privilege, and for preventing frauds on the Post office was referred to the Committee on Post-Offices and Post roads— The Committees were called for reports— Then, Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the chair on the tariff bill— Hour speeches from Howell Cobb of Georgia, Joseph M’Dowell of Ohio, Joseph R Ingersoll, and David L.

The nominating convention consisted of 275 members, each State having a number equal to that of her representation in the two houses of Congress The nomination was unanimous, adopted by exclamation and with shouts of unbounded enthusiasm— Yesterday the convention numbered thousands—perhaps tens of thousands, and the ratification was as unanimous and enthusiastic as the nomination. All this day a succession of the delegates from sundry States, visiting Washington before their return home were introduced to me in the house, and about 20 of them called on me at my house in the Evening— On my way to the house I stop’d again at Haas’s shop, and he took three more Daguerrotype likenesses of me, one of which is for Mr Lambden at Philadelphia— At the house after sundry preliminaries, they went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the Chair on the Tariff bill— Absalom H. Chappell of Georgia, and who in Georgia passes for a whig, made an hour speech in favour of the bill—followed by Luther Severance of Maine in a speech of equal longitude on the other side of the question.— Henry C— Murphy of Brooklyn Long Island descanted against the tariff— Julius Rockwell of the 7th. Congressional District of Massachusetts, pronounced his maiden speech, an impressive one, not quite animated enough, for the tariff. The new member from the Pittsburgh— Pennsylvania District, quite a young man supported the same cause with more ardour and vehemence— Andrew Kennedy took the floor, but the Committee rose— Cave Johnson moved a suspension of the rules, for a resolution to grant the use of the hall, for the friends of peace to-morrow evening—only 52 voted for it.— The Speaker, concluded that it was useless to put the negative of the question— The Resolution was lost— Adjourned— "

The stream of visitors, returning delegates from the Baltimore conventions is yet copious and unabated. many of my old acquaintances come to shake hands with me as they pass, and many others ask to be introduced to me for the same purpose. Their names are seldom pronounced by their introducers so that I distinctly hear them, and their names and their persons slip alike from my memory, the moment they part from me. But they consume time, and multiply subjects of excitement tending to distraction— At the same time the Treaty for the annexation of Texas to the United States, with the President’s message transmitting it to the Senate and the accompanying documents, prematurely published, and the conflicting opinions of the leading men of the Union, disclosed in Letters and speeches at public meetings, all indicate the immediate crisis of a great struggle between Slavery and Freedom throughout the world— I must retire from this contest, or perish under it probably before the close of the present year, or even of the present Session of Congress— The issue is precipitated by its bearing on the approaching Presidential election. It is John Tyler’s last card for a popular whirlwind to carry him through, and he has played it with equal intrepidity and address. He has compelled Clay and Van Buren to stake their last chance upon opposition to the measure now, and has forced himself upon the whole democracy as their exclusive candidate for the Presidency next December.— I called this morning at the Bank of the Metropolis, and deposited there my Son’s draught on the Merchants Bank at Boston for 254.87. for the balance due from him to Mr Thomas B. Johnson at the time of his decease.— On reaching the house, I found them in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the chair upon the tariff bill, and Andrew Kennedy the prime bawler of the democracy, howling and bullying at the tariff of duties levied on the planter and farmer to put into the pocket of the manufacturer, and raving at the abominable doctrine of protection Charles Hudson followed with a cool solid and judicious argument for the principle and a mass of statistical details in support of it— The slack tide of debate then came— No one started for the floor. David L. Seymour called for the question on his amendment, 30 instead of 15 percent ad valorem on coarse wool, per pound— Collamer moved an amendment to the amendment. 3 cents per pound additional, and strike out the rest of the section— Collamer began to speak but Duncan disputed his right and claimed the floor to discuss the bill. Hopkins decided that Collamer had the right to the floor, but he gave it up and withdrew his amendment— Duncan was not ready and moved the Committee to rise. Adjourned after 2. Evening Music in the Presidents grounds. "

I attended public worship alone this morning at the Hall of the house of Representatives, where I found a stranger, making a prayer, with Mr Tuston the Chaplain to the Senate, at the Clerk’s Table— The hall was crowded and I had some difficulty, in obtaining a seat— The preacher from the Speaker’s chair, was the Revd. William Dwight of Portland Maine a son of the celebrated Dr Dwight—some time President of Yale College. His text was from Hebrews 11.27—“for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible”— The first part of the verse is—[“]By faith he (Moses) for sook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king.”—was not part of the text but after some slight reference of the application of the text to Moses the main discourse was a delineation of the character of the man who endures as seeing him who is invisible— It was deeply impressively eloquent and solemn. After the close of the service, Mr Tuston introduced Mr Dwight to me— I walked home, accompanied by Mr Stout from western New-York, whom I saw last October at Canandaigua one of the most noted of the delegates from New York to the late Baltimore nominating convention— He was going to dine with his representative Charles Carroll at his brother’s— After dinner at the second presbyterian church, I heard again Mr Dwight, from Matthew 11.28. “Come unto me all ye, that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest—” A sermon more affecting and solemn than that of the morning— The division was first into the invitation—the classes of mankind, to whom the invitation was addressed, and the promise to those who will come, and secondly, the several classes of the labouring and heavy-laden to whom the invitation was addressed—the heavy laden with cares—with sorrows—with sin—each of these furnished varieties of specification deeply pathetic—cares for personal wants—for support of families; for the well being, health, conduct and good name of children— Sorrows—all the ills that flesh is heir to— Disease of body and of mind—reverses of fortune— Loss of children and of friends. Sins—the grievous burden of a wounded conscience— Loss of reputation—open transgression, and the reproach of the world— Come unto me says the blessed Jesus, to all these sufferers, and I will give you rest.— How tender—how affectionate! how altogether lovely!— And will you not accept this invitation?— This was the final appeal—urged with prevailing power. To me it was emphatic warning—would that its effects could have been permanent upon my Soul.— The heart was edified by the exhortations of these discourses—but the conduct remains unchanged— David Lee Child was here this evening. He goes for New-York to-morrow. "

Saunders, claimed a privileged right to report in part from the select Committee on the fray between John White and George Rathbun.

Moore, who fired the pistol, and wounded Wirt the policeman The committee had no doubt of the power of the house to punish him for the contempt, but they thought it most expedient to turn him over to the judicial tribunals, and reported a resolution to that effect, which was adopted. As to the third charge upon the Committee to report a Bill or Resolution for punishing or repressing disorders in the house for the future, they were not ready to report as yet—and he moved to lay the report and testimony on the table and print; and he moved the previous question— The report was however not satisfactory to Mr White moved to recommit the report, which raised a rancorous debate of four hours, after which the debate was postboned to next Thursday week, and the report and testimony to be printed— Then at 4 Committee of the whole Union, Hopkins in the chair, and Duncan made a half of an hour speech and moved the Committee to rise and the house adjourned— Evening visitors as reported in the margin— "

Tuesday  General Erastus Root a long celebrated and popular politician of the State of New-York and of the Delegates to the Clay-Convention of the last week at Baltimore, called on me this morning to solicit my interposition with the Mexican President Santa Anna to obtain the release of Cyrus K Gleason, one of the Texan Prisoners taken at Mier, and confined in the Castle at Perote— He went from the neighbourhood of General Root’s residence—and he read to me a memorial numerously signed by his neighbours intreating his good offices to liberate the young man, and particularly to apply for mine— Mr Henry Johnson a Senator from Louisiana came to my seat yesterday with a Letter from J. H. Leverich dated New-Orleans 20. April last, requesting him to procure my good offices in the same way for a young man named Hedenberg (A. D) of a respectable family in New-Jersey, in the same predicament with Gleason— I answered in both cases that if the relations of Peace with Mexico should be restored I would apply to General Almonte so far as may be proper, believing that the present existing state of things forbids any application from me to the Mexican President— Mrs Telfair was also here this morning— The Committee have reported a bill for her relief, and she came to urge me to call it up. I had expected that the Death of Henry R. Brinkerhoff a member from Ohio who had never taken his seat, and the notice of whose decease was received here yesterday would have been received announced this morning, with the usual obituary notices, and an adjournment of the house without doing any business—instead of which I found Dr Duncan, delivering in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, first Weller and then Hopkins in the chair, the second half of his anti-tariff speech which he had broke off in the middle, yesterday.— Hardin of Illinois followed him for an hour on the Tariff side, and then Robert Barnwell Rhett of South-Carolina vapoured away his hour, upon the inconsistency of a tariff for protection with the natural rights of mankind— This Prince of Slavemongers is eternally raving against the injustice of taxing one man for the benefit of another.— The next blatant orator against the tariff was George A. Caldwell of Columbia 4th. Congressional district of Kentucky.— Alexander H. Stevens of Georgia, swept away all this dust as a gale sweeps the Pennsylvania avenue. George Rathbun came next—chilling cold after Stevens’s furnace—while he was prosing Winthrop came and said they were going to sit till midnight, and invited me to go and dine with him at his lodgings, which I did. At 1/2 past 6. I returned to the house— At 1/2 past 5. after a Texas speech from Tibbats, they took a recess till 7. The Speaker then took the chair, and the house adjourned by yeas and nays 22 to 14. "

Mr Lewis Johnson called this morning to enquire concerning the papers which he had left with me sustaining his claim as Administrator of Williams Otis, for the further allowance of interest upon the sum admitted to be due to him and which has been paid— He had requested me to examine these papers and if I approved them to write to Mr M’Culloch the Comptroller, or see him again to urge the Justice of the claim. I have waded through the papers which are voluminous, and begun writing to the Comptroller but have not yet finished my remarks on the case. But I read to Mr Johnson, a Letter that I had received a month since from Norton Quincy Thaxter, asking the return of a power of Attorney from Ximenes and Cogley to him which he had sent by me to Mr Johnson last Summer— Mr Johnson sent it to me this Evening to be forwarded to Mr Thaxter— The multitude of these petty details of private business requiring a continuous memory of incidents occurring at distant intervals of time is oppressive beyond all endurance— I am sinking irrecoverably under it.— I found the house in Session, discussing a motion made by Weller to repeal the order to take the Tariff Bill out of the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union at one O’Clock this day, and to protract the debate upon it till one O’Clock next Friday—but all the chicanery of order uses used to defeat this proposal, which failed by a vote of 92 to 77. not two thirds, Barnard appealed from the decision of the Speaker, that it required a majority of two thirds to rescind the resolution to take the bill out of Committee this day; but the Speaker’s decision was sustained— The skirmishing continued till near half past 12. and Burt of South Carolina had but the fragment of an hour for his solemn stupefactions— At one, the voting on the amendments commenced and continued three long hours, most of the amendments offered being rejected, but some of them adopted— At last the Committee rose and reported the Bill, and M’Kay chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means took the floor.— Barnard said he wanted to prove that this was not a revenue Bill, and would not yield the amount of revenue indispensable for the Government and there was much negotiation against a previous question before Saturday afternoon but no pledge obtained— In the midst of the parley an adjournment was moved and carried— Mr Clay was in the house again— I gave him a copy of Charles’s pamphlet on Texas and the Massachusetts Resolutions.

A new subject of political excitement is opening upon this country, the extent and duration of which it is impossible for me to foresee, but which must have great influence for good or evil (God grant it may be for good) upon the future history and fortunes of this Union— It is a deadly feud between the Native american poor population, and the Roman Catholic Irish multitudes gathered in the city of Philadelphia— The animosities between these two classes of people have been fermenting in all our atlantic cities for several years, and have been much aggravated by the pernicious factious influence of these Irish Catholics over the elections in all the populous cities.— The reaction of the native American population effected a total revolution in the recent election of the City Government of New-York— They have now broken out in furious riots at Philadelphia, where from the first of this week a succession of bitterly exasperated mobs, have destroyed multitudes of human lives—dwelling houses, schools and churches, unrestrained by the Government of the City or of the State.— At the house this morning immediately after the reading of the Journal Emery D. Potter of Toledo—5th. congressional District of Ohio announced the decease on the 30th. of last Month of Henry R. Brinkerhoff of Plymouth, 21st. district of that State— He had been sick at home from the commencement of the Session and never taken his seat.— Mr Potter is himself a young man not much accustomed to public speaking— He gave as usual a short biographical eulogy upon the deceased who was one of the self-made men who compose the great majority of the rulers of this country— He was 56 years old—born in Adams County Pennsylvania, of humble parents, the same year that I was graduated at Cambridge—emigrated in early boyhood with his father’s family to the wilderness of Cayuga County, New-York— Served as a Militia Officer in the last War with England—twice elected a member of the New-York Legislature Removed to Huron County Ohio in 1837. and in 1843 was elected to this 28th Congress from a District, Mr Potter said opposed to him in politics—owing no doubt to an opposite vote divided between two whigh candidates— A very common result where a mere plurality carries the election— Mr Potter moved the usual honorary neurological resolutions which were adopted without further remark, including the adjournment of the house. General Root came and brought to my seat a Letter containing a statement of the application of his neighbours for interposition with the Mexican President Santa-Anna to obtain the liberation of Cyrus K. Gleason— I walked home under a burning summer sun, and stop’d on my way at the Franklin Insurance Company. Received a dividend of 10 per Cent 633:50. which I deposited in the Patriotic Bank 254.87. as Executor of T. B. Johnson for the balance received from my Son, and 378.63. on my own account. "

I received yesterday a number of pamphlet copies of my Son’s 9 Essays, first published in the Boston Courier on Texas and the Massachusetts Resolutions; and distributed a few of them, and also some other papers, which have been sent to me for that purpose— I received a check from the Speaker on the Bank of the Metropolis for 800 dollars and purchased of Charles J. Nourse 1000 dollars of Washington City Corporation 6 per Cent Stock at one per cent advance— This is a re-investment of the annual payment of 300 dollars received on theof April fromMorsell, and of the dividend received yesterday from the Franklin Insurance company— At the house Shepherd Cary a Democrat from Maine, and William L. Goggin a whig from Virginia successor to the late Thomas W. Gilmer took their seats— A Letter of resignation was read from Dixon H. Lewis of Alabama, whose twenty score of flesh have been transferred from slumber in the house to sleep in the Senate— He takes there the place of William R. King, a gentle Slavemonger, called by Jackson, Miss Nancy, and now appointed Minister to France, for a quarrel and threatened duel with H. Clay in 1841— The doom of the Tariff bill had been fixed for this day.— When the Bill was on Wednesday reported from the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to the house, the league of Slavery and besotted democracy, which rules the house and the land, dared not spring the previous question upon the debate. They wanted an hour speech from M’Kay, chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means to wash down the pill, and Barnard, a member of the minority of that Committee claimed an hour to discuss the bill, as a measure of revenue— There was some dirty chicanery to deprive Barnard of the floor, but M’Kay in order to reserve for himself the last word, yielded the floor to Barnard, who in a speech full to the point demonstrated the utter absurdity of the bill as a measure of revenue— M’Kay replied feebly, and in a tone of voice so low that the house could not hear him—but he killed his hour— Cullom moved the previous question— Cave Johnson moved a call of the house, 203 members answered— Elmer moved to lay the bill and amendments on the table— Carried 105 to 99. Irvin moved to reconsider Lost 99 to 103— Motions to adjourn and postpone, lost before taking the question of reconsideration— Stewart said as there had been a death he moved to adjourn, and the house adjourned. Evening visits from Messrs. Connell and Lee—and at the invitation of Mr Winthrop I attended at his lodgings an evening party of all the whigs in Congress, at his lodgings. Mr. Clay was there. "

Saturday  I called this morning at the bank of the Metropolis and deposited there the check for 800 dollars received yesterday from the Speaker, and then drew a check for 1010. payable to the order of C. J. Nourse, for the certificate of Washington city corporation 6. per cent, which he sent me in the course of the day.— I have taken this course to retain written notices of the whole transaction— At the house Mr John Connell, entertain a hope that this day would be allowed to private business which for several weeks has been entirely excluded. But not a movement was made to take it up. This was the first of three days, assigned for the consideration of business concerning the District of Columbia— They had already been substituted for the first three days of the month, the original assignment, and Duncan had moved a reconsideration, with a view to take up his bill for holding up the Presidential election on the same day throughout the Union. The question of reconsideration was taken by yeas and nays, on a motion of Campbell chairman of the Committee on the District to lay it on the table. Carried 83 to 78.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Joseph R. Ingersoll in the Chair. Campbell, who is at death’s door in a consumption moved to take up the bill to extend the Charters of the District Banks— Cave Johnson first objected to this and proposed to take up the Senate’s bill to recharter the banks—but that has not yet passed the Senate. Cave Johnson still insisted upon taking up some other bill— After no small chicanery, to decide whether the bill was or was not taken up Cave Johnson prevailed to take the question by tellers and it was decided not to take it up 77 to 80. The bill taken up, was that providing for the insane asylum in the District of Columbia; whereupon an excursive debate sprung up and continued nearly three hours, and which terminated by changing from a bill to provide for an asylum to a mere appropriation to pay the board of the insane of the district now at Baltimore. The bill was then laid aside, and afterwards reported to the house and a bill in substance to abolish imprisonment for debt in the District of Columbia, was next taken up and started another debate which continued till past 4. and then the Committee rose and the house adjourned— At the request of Mr Morgan of New-York, I sat for Mr Anthony who took a Daguerrotype likeness of me. The Association of American Geologists and Naturalists have been several days in session here Commander Wilkes gave them a party this Evening to which he invited me, and which I attended— The meeting was numerous, but very few of them were known to me.— The paintings, engravings and maps of the exploring expedition were exhibited to view.— My family went to a concert by the famous violinist Vieux Tems "

It had been announced for several successive weeks that Mr Tinsley the Chaplain of the house would preach a funeral discourse on the members of Congress recently deceased, and chiefly with reference to Heman Allen Moore. A succession of Strangers however occupied the Speakers chair on Sunday mornings—when it was Mr Tinsley’s turn, until this day when he gave the promised discourse to a very thin auditory. My wife, Mrs John Adams and her daughter Mary-Louisa went with me. Mr Tinsleys text was from Amos 4.12—“prepare to meet thy God.” an awful admonition— The whole chapter is a terrible denunciation of divine judgments against the kingdom of Israel, for disregarding his chastisements and not returning to him— There was very little application of the discourse to Mr Moore or of any other of the recent sufferers except Thomas W. Gilmer whose virtues were again commemorated, and whose hapless fate was again deplored. Every dispensation of heaven, gracious or afflictive should operate as exhortation to wise and righteous action, but human ignorance and error make no account of them or give them a wrong direction— I dare not attribute the sudden and violent death of one man to a special retributive Providence any more than the natural and easy death of another.— Our heavenly father causeth his Sun to rise and his rain to fall alike upon the Evil and the Good, nor is perhaps sudden and instantaneous death more a token of divine wrath than the lingering tortures of dissolution by slow disease— Before dinner we had a visit from Mr Henry Clay, to take leave— In good health— He goes to-morrow for his home at Ashland in Kentucky.— His prospects of election to the Presidency are at this time brighter than they have ever been before, and I sincerely believe his success desirable for the best interests of the Country. There was again no service this afternoon at St John’s Church— I attended at the second Presbyterian, and heard Mr Knox from Matthew 25.21. [“]His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou has been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” Mr Knox is eloquent, fluent, rich in the copia verborum, and in his zeal evidently sincere— After the sermon, he gave an interesting account of his recent attendance at the dedication of a new presbyterian church at some village in Maryland, with symptoms of a revival— I made out this evening partly to answer two Letters from W. H. Seward of Auburn—New-York— Feebly. "

An hour and a half exhausted his patience and mine, and I promised him another hour to-morrow morning— At the house this was the alternate Monday assigned by the rules of the house for the reception of Petitions, but since the 26th. of February, every petition and resolution day has been diverted to other business— Petitions may be entered at the Clerk’s table— Resolutions can be introduced by any member of the majority, but by no other— There were two special orders for this day—one the joint Resolution from the Senate to adjourn on the 27th. of May next—and the other, the district business, for the consideration of which this was the second of the three days— Cave Johnson called up immediately the Resolution for adjournment and moved the previous question—he was intent upon forcing the question upon the day—the 27th. bu the majority had determined against him that the adjournment should be fixed for the 17th. of June—propositions were made for substituting the 17th. and the 18th. of June; and Charles J. Ingersoll was urgent for striking out the day and leaving it in blank, alledging that the Committee of Foreign affairs had Treaties under their consideration— Cave Johnson still insisted upon his previous question till Parmenter observed that the 27th of May next would defer the adjournment till the next year Cave then moved to strike out the word next and insert current—cavil against this followed, and Cave retreated back again upon his call for the previous question— Charles J. Ingersoll then moved to lay the Resolution on the table—lost 22 to 178.— The motion for the previous question was also lost 56 to 112— The 17th. of June was substituted for the 27th of May next 114 to 88. and then the Senate Resolution was concurred in, without division— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Joseph R.

                "text": "14. IV:30 Tuesday.  I received yesterday morning, in the house a note from the Revd. Obadiah B. Brown informing me that he was now ready to settle his debt, and would call on me for that purpose whenever it would suit my convenience— I answered that I would see him at my house at 7. O’Clock last evening; at which time he came and paid me 1070 dollars for his note of 1000. and 70 dollars for interest from 11. March 1843. This morning I deposited the bills at the Bank of the Metropolis and immediately after, purchased of Corcoran and Riggs, brokers a certificate for 1000 dollars of Washington City Corporation 6 per cents for 3/4 of one per cent advance— They sent me the certificate in the course of the day. From half past 9 O’Clock I sat to Mr John Cranch and Mr Bingham who occupy jointly the painting room for my portrait— At the house I found the clerk reading the journal of yesterday— Dawson introduced a Resolution of the Legislature of Louisiana relating to a survey of parts of the red river. Campbell moved to cease debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the Washington City charter Bill at 1/2 past 12 O’Clock this day, carried without opposition— There was then a sharp struggle by Campbell to get the District Bank Bill from the Senate into Committee of the whole in which he finally succeeded, but could not get it taken up there. Cave Johnson, Weller, and Burke, trip’d him up in his oft repeated motions to take it up. Burke once moved to lay it on the table—lost by yeas and nays 70 to 94. but in Committee of the whole, where the yeas and nays cannot be taken, three successive motions to take it up were lost taken by tellers, with a quorum present, a majority of them voting to take up the bill, and a portion of the minority purposely not passing through the tellers; and thereby balking a quorum vote— A call of the house was moved, but refused— Campbell kept his temper, and carried sundry other district bills, first through the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Joseph R. Ingersoll in the Chair, and then through the Committee of the whole Samuel F. Vinton in the Chair; the two Committees successively rose, and about half past 4. the house adjourned, without acting upon any of the reported bills— The three days devoted to the consideration of District business have passed away, and the only bill of much importance to the District or the Country has been excluded from consideration by the party tactics of Cave Johnson, Weller and Burke— The Senate this day by a vote of 24 to 16. on the motion of R. J. Walker of Mississippi, laid on the table the joint Resolution to adjourn on the 17th of June— 12 members absent are not voting—a very bad omen— I took a short walk after dinner. Evening visit from Mr Thom. I answered two Letters from E. D. Marchant. "

Wednesday  I called at the Office of Corcoran and Riggs, and paid for the certificate of Washington City Corporation 6. per cents received from them yesterday by a check on the Bank of the Metropolis for 1007.50.— The names in the margin, are those including my own of the select Committee, to whom on the 19th. of Feby last was referred the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, on the Resolution of the House of the 3d. of January concerning the present condition of the Smithsonian fund— I met them at 10 this morning in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures; all present except Houston and Chappell who were duly notified— We had barely time to read the Will of Smithson—the act of Congress accepting the bequest and the report of the Secretary of the Treasury referred to the Committee; and adjourned to meet to-morrow at 10. O’Clock— In the house, Dellet of Alabama, by leave, presented Resolutions of a meeting at Mobile for the re-annexation of Texas, which without reading were laid on the table— M’Kay made an abortive attempt to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the appropriation bills, the Committees were called for Reports, many of which were presented, and among them two from the Post office Committee; the majority report announcing a bill, not yet ready.— And Charles J. Ingersoll from the Committee of foreign affairs reported a Resolution requesting the President to rescind as soon as may be done without giving just cause of complaint the reciprocity Treaties with the Hanse towns, Denmark and Sweden, and to modify that with Great Britain— Saunders chairman of the select Committee on the fight between White and Rathbun moved to reprint 2000 extra copies of the report and testimony, which after some wrangling was lost by yeas and nays 91. to 79.—not two thirds— Campbell moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the District Banks bill, interrupted by a resolution, moved by Weller to give 150 dollars to John L. Wirt for the expenses of his wound received in the fray between White and Rathbun, which was instantly carried without a negative vote— Campbell’s motion was lost by yeas and nays 59 to 112. Duncan’s bill for holding the election of Electors of President and Vice-President of the United States, on the same day throughout the Union, was taken up and driven through, rejecting an amendment moved by Elmer to postpone the operation of the act till after the election immediately approaching, and after two hours spent on a call of the house till twelve members were brought in, in custody of the Serjeant at arms, and then all further procedings were superseded.

Dr R. S. Storrs— I was not then at home. He called again this morning, and told me he had come here to apply to the bureau of supplies for the navy Department to obtain a contract to furnish several thousand pair of shoes for the navy. But he found it was too late— Others had preoccupied the ground, and as the contract must be given to the lowest bidder at whatever price he should offer to deliver the shoes they would offer to deliver them at two cents a pair lower— He should be obliged to take a subcontract as he had been the last year upon which the original contractors had realized enormous profits, and he little or nothing. They had contracted to deliver the shoes at 1 dollar and 10 cents a pair, for which he had been obliged to take 87 1/2 cents— They were to furnish them this year at 90 cents a pair, and the quality of the shoes must be more than proportionally debased— I met again the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest—the same members present as yesterday. The Report of the Secretary of the Treasury evades all explanation of the manner how the fund was almost entirely invested in bonds of the State of Arkansas, upon which no interest has been paid except in other bonds of the same State, and upon which for more than two years no interest has been paid at-all— How to make the fund now available for any appropriation by Congress to the purposes of the testator, was the question first discussed, and upon which the Committee came to no result.— Then I read the Bill reported by the select Committee on the 12th. of April 1842, and after some conversation the Committee adjourned to next Monday 10. O’Clock. for the Chairman consulting with judge French to prepare some specific measure to be discussed for report to the house— In the house I moved a suspension of the rules to present a Memorial from the American statistical association, on the errors in the printed 6th census—lost 97 to 49. I called on the Speaker to vote, as his vote if in the affirmative would have carried the two thirds— He refused to vote, and said if he did vote it would be in the negative— After some wrangling debate, the report on the White and Rathbun fisticuffs and the whole subject was laid on the table— The Eastern harbour bill was crammed through and finally carried by yeas and nays 96 to 80.— Holmes made two attempts to adjourn over to Monday. Both failures by yeas and nays. The ostensible reason was to ventilate and summer dress the hall— The real one to attend the races— "

My wife was very unwell all day yesterday and had a very disturbed night— The last evening was of the calm summer sultry heat, the most insupportable to me of this climate, and disabled me totally for writing and for all action mental or bodily— Mr Hawley paid us an evening visit, convalescent from a fit of severe indisposition. He conversed rationally and piously upon his own condition, approaching the last stage of life, and made many remarks more applicable to me than to himself. I went this morning to the house, with a hope that they would devote this day to the consideration of private claims which for several weeks have been totally neglected.— I entered at the clerk’s table the Memorial from the American statistical Association, with direction to refer it to the select Committee on Statistics. The chairman of that Committee Zadok Pratt promised me, that they should report upon it to the house— But the Slave Oligarchy will yet prevail to suppress this document. In the house Saunders attempted to bring up the quarrel again, on the pretence of a privileged question, alledging that White had yesterday cast reflections upon his report, which he considered as reflections upon him, and he demanded an explanation— White said nothing, and the Speaker told Saunders that this was not a privileged question— The only good thing done by the house was at the motion of David L. Seymour, to transfer from the Committee of the whole house to the Committee of the whole house on the state of the Union, the house bill N. 7. extending the widows revolutionary pensions. Dean insisted upon going into committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the Navy retrenchment Bill, but Vance called loudly for the orders of the day, on private claims and I conjured the house to give one day to mercy—in vain. Deans motion was almost unanimously rejected— The house went into Committee of the whole on private Bills— The Speaker called John White to the Chair; but he said he had an engagement elsewhere. The Speaker then gave the chair to Cave Johnson— A bill to allow a compensation to Seth Sweetser was laid aside—then came a bill to compensate Captain Allen of the ship Cadmus, for bringing General La Fayette from France in 1824 sprung a debate, which soon became sharp pointed— David L. Seymour to report against the passage of the bill.— Vote 62 to 45. no quorum— After a vain and heartless struggle the Committee rose and reported no quorum— At one O’Clock the house adjourned over to Monday at 11. I went to the chamber of the Committee of manufactures and wrote till 4— Then home. "

Mr Persico’s statues of Columbus and the Indian girl were yesterday taken from their boxes and hoisted upon the pedestal at the left summit of the flight of steps to the eastern central entrance to the Rotundo of the Capitol— The workman had been two days in raising the two statues, and as I left the Capitol yesterday to come home I saw them fully exposed— Soon after dinner Persico came to my house, almost convulsed with agitation to tell me that the statues were up, and was quite mortified when I told him I had seen them.— He was anxious to have been the first to announce to me the memorable event and he was going to announce it to President Tyler, and the Secretary of State Calhoun. He wanted also to shew me the statues, and hear what I should think of them, and I agreed to meet him there Monday morning— Aaron Lenox is an old ex-marine twice wounded in the last War with England: a petitioner for a pension, but destitute of sufficient evidence to sustain his claim.— Mrs Telfair came again— I told her I had yesterday supplicated the house to consider the private claims, and had chiefly hers in view— But they could not keep a quorum, and adjourned over to Monday— I despaired of all private claims before the house for this Session.— I took the papers relating to the claim of interest on the public debt due to the Administrator of William Otis, with my remarks upon them, to the first Comptroller of the Treasury M’Culloh and left them with him. He was engaged with another person— I told him the substance of my remarks— He said he would re-examine the case, and call and see me at my house before making his final decision.— I called at the Department of State, and spoke with the Secretary John C.

Upon the errors in the printed Census of 1840.— He called Mr Derrick to answer me on the first and second points; and answered like a true slave-monger on the third. He writhed like a trodden rattlesnake, on the exposure of his false report to the house, that no material errors have been discovered in the printed census of 1840—and finally said that where there were so many errors they balanced one another, and led to the same conclusion as if they were all correct— Calls, by Lewis Johnson Commodore Morris and Mr Thom.— After dinner I went with Isaac Hull—and Mary to see the Buffalo hunt at the race course— A wretched exhibition.

Mr Anderson, Minister of a Baptist church in Salem Massachusetts, would preach in the hall of the house of Representatives this morning— I went there to hear him, but the hall was not yet in order, and no public worship could be held there.— I returned immediately, and at the second Presbyterian Church heard Mr Knox, preach from Hosea 6.4. “O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early dew, it goeth away.” Mr Knox remarked upon the extraordinary stirring vivacity of the style of the scriptural prophets—in no instance more remarkable than in this text— Ephraim and Judah, are the two kingdoms— The book of Hosea extends over a period of 60 years from 784 to 724. before Christ, and is cotemporaneous with that of Isaiah.— Throughout the Book;—the sins of the two Peoples in punishment for which the judgments of God are denounced consist first of idolatry, figured under the name of adultery, and whoredom an imagery carried through the whole of the old testament, from the departure out of Egypt to the restoration of Jerusalem and the building of the second temple— The divine mission of Hosea is of a character so revolting that it requires Faith almost superhuman to be reconciled to— The prophet is commanded by the word of the Lord to commit a disgusting crime The narrative cannot be read with decency; and yet the book is a code of the purest morality, and the tenderest affections. What can be more compassionate than these apostrophes to Ephraim and Judah? What more thrilling than the likening of their goodness to the morning cloud and the early dew— Mr Knox gave notice that the Revd. Mr. Ewing of Philadelphia, would preach at 4 this afternoon— I believe, a son of my old friend Samuel Ewing, many years gone to the world of Spirits— I went to hear this young man, whose text was from Job 12.7. “But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee” Mr Ewing’s manner is over emphatic, and with critical hearers incurs the charge of affectation—so said Mr Hazard whom I met in coming out of church—but his zeal is glowing and his heart sincere— We had evening visits from General Clinch—Mrs Dawson, and Mr and Mrs Toombs of Georgia— My wife is recovering— Louisa quite unwell.

III:30— IV:15 Monday  I had prepared a draught of a Bill, making an appropriation of 700,000 dollars from the treasury; to assume the annual interest on the Smithson fund, invested now in stocks of several States, and upon interest the payment of which is suspended; which draught I proposed to submit to the consideration of the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest at their meeting this morning. But only one member of the Committee Jacob S. Yost attended.— I read my draught of a bill to him; and we agreed to meet again next Wednesday morning at 1/2 past 9.— Persico was not at the entrance of the Capitol, where I had agreed to meet me; but I received a note from him this evening, stung by a censorial article in the Baltimore Sun, upon the nakedness of his Indian girl— In the house there was no attempt made to call for resolutions. But Campbell offered Resolutions from a portion of his constituents for the re-annexation of Texas, which were laid on the table and ordered to be printed.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, George C. Dromgoole in the Chair— Several bills were proposed to be taken up by several members— Dean was very urgent to take up his navy retrenchment bill— Campbell to take up the District Banks bill; and John W. Davis to take up the bill to reduce and graduate the price of the public lands.— But Dromgoole playing into the hands of M’Kay, put first the question upon his motion to tae up the Post-Office appropriation Bill and it was carried— Garret Davis moved to reduce the pay of the special agents of the Postmaster general, and told a very shameful story about Wickliffe’s employing one of these agents to electioneer against him and for his competitor a nephew of Wickliff— Davis said he had charged this upon Wickliff to his face, and twice told him it was a cowardly action to which Wickliff’s only reply was, that is a matter of opinion Mr Davis. Rathbun moved to strike out the appropriation for the special agents to which Schenk moved an addition to leave an appropriation of 5000 dollars to defray the expence of declaring frauds this amendment was carried and reported to the house, and the Navy Appropriation bill, and this after some skirmishing brought on a premeditated debate upon Texas— Holmes of South-Carolina broached it in a set and laboured speech others will follow.

Jones, the Speaker of the house who put Weller into the chair while this matter was before the house. The report was laid on the table and ordered to be printed— The documents were ordered to be postponed till to-morrow on the motion for printing them. Robert C. Schenk announced a minority report to be presented hereafter.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Dromgoole in the Chair— Duncan moved to take up the bill for the occupation of the Oregon, by extending over it the jurisdiction of the territory of Ioway, and he called for Tellers, who returned the vote 30 to 95— As I passed through the tellers in the negative, to Duncan, “not quite yet, Doctor”— And I might have said not at all.— The naval appropriation bill was taken up. Parmenter had moved an amendment to specify some parts of the appropriation, and Cave Johnson moved to strike out all appropriations for the Navy-yard at Washington, and to establish a Navy yard at Memphis, Tennessee— Sample and Ashe made warm speeches in favour of this amendment, whereupon Cave Johnson withdrew it, and Washington of Hunt moved to limit the sum to be expended for the service of the Navy, excepting for the Navy-Yard to one half the whole amount before the first of January 1845— Hunt supported his amendment with A speech avowing his apprehension that the President will squander the appropriations to plunge the Country into a War, by his usurpation of the Constitutional power of Congress. Archibald Atkinson then broke out with an annexation speech; backed by one from Robert Dale Owen, the Scotch infidel from Lanark— Morse made a short speech on the other side— James E. Belser followed with a red hot Texan annexation speech; and was answered by Giddings with an intrepid exposure of the whole transaction of the Texan Treaty— He was frequently interrupted by several of the Slavers in a an overbearing and bullying tone and in every instance met and signally discomfited them— W. W. Payne swelled with venom like a toad and threatened a Resolution to maintain the dignity of the house, but Dromgoole pronounced it not in order, and M’Kay moved to take the bill out of Committee to-morrow at 3. O’Clock P.M. adjourned after 5 Evening visits from W. Cost Johnson and John Connell. "

The Meeting of the select Committee on the Smithsonian bequest was appointed for half past 9 O’Clock this morning, but with myself only three other members of the Committee were in attendance, Brengle, Potter and Yost— Not a Quorum. I read to them my draught of a bill for appropriating 700000 dollars from the Treasury for carrying into immediate effect the purposes of the Testator which they all approved; and they were also willing also to report again the bill which was reported in 1842. We adjourned to meet again next Saturday— I then gave a sitting of half an hour to Gibert who retouched my portrait which he had painted from the life He has also painted another portrait of me from the daguerrotype likeness taken by Anthony and Edwards— A hideous likeness— At the house, Belser of Alabama and Cobb of Georgia presented Resolutions of meetings in those States in favour of the immediate annexation of Texas. Cave Johnson called up his motion to reconsider the order to print the documents reported by the Committee of Elections on the contest between Botts and Jones. The vote to reconsider passed, without opposition, and then the consideration of the motion to print was postponed till next Saturday. Then Hamilton Fish of New-York city offered a resolution for the appointment of a select Committee of five to enquire and report to the house whether the franking privilege of any member of the house has been violated by any deputy Postmaster or officer of the Post Office Department under any regulation or Instruction of the Department.— Fish was at first screwed out of his motion upon the point of order, by the Speaker; but he afterwards renewed and carried it, by obtaining a suspension of the rules. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Dromgoole in the chair The naval appropriation bill was taken up and debated till 3. O’Clock, and then commenced the voting upon the multitude of proposed amendments, which continued till past 4. when the Committee rose— Several messages from the President were presented by the Speaker—among which, one in answer to the call of 3 January last for copies of the instructions to the squadrons on the coast of Africa— The copies are refused.— Adjourned, and I walked home— Mr Wines and Mr Madison Cutts were here this evening.

I began the draught of a Report to accompany the Bill which I propose to report from the select Committee on the Smithsonian bequest, but made little progress in it— I sat an hour to Mr Cranch, and Mr Bingham for my portrait— At the house Howell Cobb of Georgia made a desperate and repeated struggle to introduce and have printed a string of Resolutions adopted at a small village popular meeting in Georgia. White objected not to the reception or laying on the table of the Resolutions, but to their being printed. Cobb persisted and moved a suspension of the rules— White moved a call of the house—lost 42 to 121. only 163 in all, 40 members absent or not voting— Cobb’s motion to suspend the rules was lost 75 to 99.— Duncan L. Clinch moved to suspend the rules to introduce counter-Resolutions; but the motion was not in order— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Dromgoole in the chair— Naval Appropriation bill first taken up numerous amendments proposed, and among them one by M’Kay Chairman of the Committee of ways and means of an additional appropriation of 600–700000 dollars, to supply the deficiencies of the last years appropriation, upon a Letter from the Secretary of the Navy that the money has been expended— I asked whether this amendment could be debated— The chairman said no—whereupon I objected to the reception of it as not in order—the rule of the house prescribing that all appropriations shall be first discussed in Committee of the whole. The Chairman declared the amendment in order— I appealed from the decision— The Committee sustained the Chairman—but M’Kay withdrew his amendment, and said he would bring it in, by a separate bill— The Post-Office appropriation Bill was afterwards taken up, and the amendment to abolish the special agents of the Post Office Department was rejected 73 to 81. Then the fortification bill from the Senate, and the Louisiana Land claim, followed till half past 4. and the house adjourned— Mrs Smith came again to pass some time with us.— Other visitors came and passed the whole or part of the evening with us— Mr Perry is a professor of Mathematics in the Navy, recently returned from a three years Cruise in the Chinese and India seas in the Constellation frigate— I walked from the house home "

Friday  Mr Connell called on me this morning to urge the devotion of this day in the house of Representatives, to private business—his claim in behalf of the heirs of Robert Fulton standing the second bill on the private Calendar.— There is not the remotest chance of the passage of this bill.— I gave a sitting of an hour to Mr Cranch and Mr Bingham, for my Portrait— I found the house in Session. Alcée La Branche was attempting to introduce Resolutions of a meeting at New-Orleans in favour of the re-annexation of Texas to the United States; and had moved to refer them to a select Committee of five— After no small trickery to carry this point Parmenter moved to lay the Resolutions on the table.— C J. Ingersoll moved a call of the house—rejected 59 to 98. And the Resolutions were laid on the table 103 to 78.— Joseph Vance, an Ohio whig moved that when the house should adjourn to Wednesday next. The motive was to give time to the members of the democracy to attend the democratic Conventions to be held at Baltimore next Monday to nominate candidates for election as President and Vice-President of the United States for four years from the 4th. of March 1845. Vance’s motion was that when the house should adjourn to-morrow, it should be to Wednesday; and he said he made it at their request— But they called the yeas and nays and rejected the motion 42 to 137. Duncan moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union; to take up the bill to extend the jurisdiction of the United States over the territory of Oregon—lost 85 to 89. Reports from Committees were called for and made in the multitudes. Joseph R. Ingersoll obtained a suspension of the rules and introduced a bill to amend the Pension Laws. Referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and David L. Seymour moved immediately to go into that Committee to take up the widows pension bill, which was done. The bill was debated till past four and numerous amendments proposed and discussed— Vance still remonstrating that this was private bill day.— At last Garret Davis moved an additional section, to extend the pension system to the warriors against the Indians until Wayne’s Treaty of Greenville, which enlarged the debate, till the Committee rose and the house adjourned— As evening visitors we has our neighbours Mrs Young and her daughter, Mr and Mrs Grinnell, Mr Winthrop and Mr Thom.

Jones, and John M. Botts, was postponed from Monday to Wednesday next— At Slidell’s motion the order was made that all debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the bill in relation to the Louisiana Land claims shall cease on Thursday next at 4 O’Clock P.M.

                "text": "26. V. Sunday.  Fahrenheit 84. in my chamber.  A day of extreme summer heat. In the hall of the house of Representatives, Mr Tinsley preached from Luke 15.18— “I will arise and go to my father” he took no more of the parable for his text; but this was enough to let into his commentary the whole story of the prodigal son—an inexhaustible fountain of the tenderest affections of the human heart. Mr Tinsley threw himself on the indulgence of a very small auditory observing that he was much indisposed and had hoped to have obtained assistance to supply his place, but had been disappointed. He spoke without notes, with sufficient fluency, but with little effect— I never hear a discourse upon this parable without being reminded of that of Sterne.— The general analogy which makes the prodigal the impersonation of all mankind in their relation to their maker, appeals to the bosom and to the conscience of every individual— The essence of the Christian religion considers every man as a sinner, and repentance as the condition of salvation— The creed requires the belief that the atonement of Christ is the price of salvation, and that doctrine was enforced this afternoon at St. John’s church, by a Stranger who read the Evening service for Whitsunday, and preached from Ephesians 2.8 “For by grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9. Not of works, lest any man should boast.” The doctrine that man cannot save himself by good works is harsh and hard to believe, but the doctrine taught by the parable of the prodigal Son is that Salvation is secured by repentance and Faith. Good works are the necessary and indispensable sequel to sincere repentance—in ceasing to do evil we learn to do good—good works are the proofs of repentance, but they are parts of the relations of man with his fellow man; not with God— They can have no merit in his intercourse with God—nor give to man the right to boast. While the preacher this afternoon was discoursing on this theme a sudden heavy thunder gust and shower came up, and there was one flash and clap so instantaneous that it might well it well have discomposed the equanimity of his nerves but did not— He only took occasion from it to notice how the life or man was liable to be cut off in an instant Walter Hellen and Mr Thom were here this evening.

This was the day on which the two democratic conventions to nominate candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, for four years from the fourth of March next were held at Baltimore— And also a Convention to nominate a candidate for the office of Governor of Maryland— By the new invention of the Electro-magnetic telegraph of professor Morse, the proceedings of these bodies throughout the day were made known here at the Capitol, and announced as soon as received in manuscript bulletins suspended to the wall in the Rotundo. I gave an hour’s sitting to Mr Cranch and Mr Bingham, after calling at the National Intelligencer Office and leaving with Mr Gales a continued list of Petitions presented by me, since the 5th. of April— And with it, I left the Boston Courier of the 14th. containing the memorial relating to the statistics of the census, which I requested Mr Gales to republish, with a reference asterisk from the entry of the memorial on my list— The use made by John C. Calhoun in his correspondence with Mr Pakenham, of these enormous blunders in the census, and his prevarication, in denying in an official report that any errors had been discovered in the census, betray so total a disregard of all moral principle that it can be attributed only to the alternative of absence of honesty or of mental sanity— Tis the fanaticism of the Slave-monger. At the house, the business of the day dragged heavily along— About 70 members chiefly of the democratic majority were absent at Baltimore, yet enough remained to controul the action of the house, and dictate what should be done— Mr Grinnell offered a Resolution requesting the joint Committee on the Library to consider the expediency of publishing 3000 copies of certain surveys of the exploring expedition, and selling them to defray the cost of publication, which was adopted. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Reuben Chapman of Alabama in the Chair, and George S Houston of the same Alabama drove through too land bills, which were reported to the house— Weller moved to adjourn over to Wednesday, but on call of the yeas and nays withdrew the motion— I had insisted upon a call of the yeas and nays to ascertain the quorum in the house 110 and 19. Adjourned at 3.— I went into the Senate chamber and heard William C. Rives close a three hours tariff speech.— After dinner, Mr Carroll the clerk of the U.S Supreme Court came and introduced to me a Revd.

The Summer heat prematurely coming upon me, as did the winter cold, from the day of my departure, last October (25) from my home at Quincy, disqualifies me, more and more from day to day for all useful action.— I gave an hour’s sitting again to Mr Cranch and Mr Bingham— It was to have been the last, but they requested one more. At the house, there was a Quorum of 135 members in attendance, under the dominion of Weller, unable to make a majority for his mischievous purposes, but sufficient to defeat any purpose of good by withholding votes necessary to make a Quorum— His course was—1. he moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up some pet measure of his own. His motion failed— Other motions were made to go into Committee which he defeated. Vance moved to take up the private bills, unobjectionable, reported to the house, last Saturday— Weller, said no—he would take up no private bill in the absence of his friend from Tennessee—Cave Johnson—the scourge of all claimants. At last David L. Seymour, carried a vote to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, with a view to take up the widows pension bill— John White was chairman of the Committee When the motion was made to take up the Bill, Weller called for a division— The votes were three to one for taking up the Bill, but Weller and his gang by not voting at-all prevented a quorum vote. Tellers were called— Four times over the count was repeated, and no quorum voted. The last count shewed 81 to 29. requiring only one vote more to make a quorum.— Weller at the issue of every count insisted that the Committee should rise and report no quorum to the house— He finally prevailed, and it being evident that no business could be done, the house between one and 2 adjourned— I had an hour of conversation with D. D. Barnard Joseph R. Ingersoll and other whigs, impatient to impeach Tyler for his manifold usurpations, and violations of the Constitution, which I dissuaded as impracticable, or a cracked gun barrel fit only to explode in the hand of him who would use it. The electro-magnetic telegraph, at the east-end of the Capitol was all day reporting every half hour the proceedings of the Conventions at Baltimore. The Tyler Convention adjourned without nominating a Vice-President. The Democratic National Convention adopted the two thirds rule and balloted 7 times between Van Buren and Cass without coming to a choice. After dinner I walked round the President’s square— We had evening visits from Mr Silsbee and his Son, and Mr Stone; all of Salem— Also from George Thom, Mary dined at her friend Mrs Turnbull’s. "

Wednesday—  It is impossible for me to describe the anxieties, under which my soul is oppressed, and which I am compelled to suppress, with reliance only upon superior power to relieve me from them— And with no hope of other relief than from the close of life, and the transition to another state of existence— The deepest of my afflictions is the degeneracy of my Country, from the principles which gave her existence—and the ruin irreparable of them all under the transcendant power of Slavery and the Slave representation.— This morning I gave another hour to Mr Cranch for my portrait. Bingham had already finished his. I had taken to them yesterday Stewart’s last Portrait of my father; of which Mr Cranch had once made a copy, but of which he wishes to make another— At the house there was a call of the yeas and nays on the passage of a bill to require the execution of bonds by Collectors of the Customs, before taking the oath of Office—to ascertain if there was a quorum present— The vote was 126 to 1. nays. The consideration of the Report of the Committee of Elections, on the contested election between the Speaker Jones, and John M Botts was postponed till next Friday— Several successive motions to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union were made and rejected, till one made by M’Kay with notice of his intention to call up the naval appropriation bill, succeeded— The house went into Committee— Weller in the chair, and took up not the naval appropriation, but the widows pension bill.— Sundry languid prosy speeches in support of Garret Daviss amendment to extend the pension Laws to the combatants against Indians till Waynes treaty of Greenville of 1795. and a further amendment to extend the system to the War of 1812. with Great-Britain— Andrew Stewart rose and said he proposed to make a speech about the Tariff— Objection was immediately made to his proceeding on the ground that any thing he could say upon the tariff would be irrelevant— The chairman after some hesitation so decided, from which decision Stewart appealed— The vote on the appeal was 54 to 4. Not within sight of a Quorum— The Committee rose, and before 2 the house adjourned— I walked home— The democratic National Convention at Baltimore this day unanimously nominated James K. Polk of Tennessee, their Candidate for the Office of President of the United States for 4 years from the 4th of March next and Silas Wright of New-York, as Vice President— B. F.

In preparing the Report to the house of the select Committee on the Smithson bequest I found it advisable to ascertain at the Treasury Department whether any further payment of interest upon any of the State bonds has been made into the Treasury since the Letter of the Secretary (John C. Spencer[)] of 19. Feby last referred to the Committee— I called at the Department, and Mr Young the chief Clerk and acting Secretary informed me that no additional payment has been made.— I then went to the Office of the Commissioner of Pensions with two Letters of enquiry respecting pension claims of Sally Clark, and of the legal representatives of Phebe Thayer. I left the Letters, with the Commissioner, James L. Edwards who promised to give me the information in writing.— At the house, most of the democratic members who have been absent, attending the Democratic Convention at Baltimore had returned. Silas Wright having finally declined their nomination of him as Vice President, they nominated George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania for that office—then passed resolutions for the immediate occupation of Texas and of Oregon and then adjourned, with a solemn protest of one of the delegates from the State of Missouri against the whole proceedings, and a declaration that Missouri would not confirm them— In the house a joint Resolution for taking sundry inventories of public property, and a catalogue of the document library of the house, was introduced by Zadok Pratt, and after some discussion referred to the joint Committee on the library of Congress— I moved to add a consideration of the expediency of printing a 10th Volume of the U.S Laws— Pratt declined accepting my amendment—his resolution was adopted— And mine was received and passed in the form of a Resolution, requiring the Clerk of the house to have a tenth volume of the Laws published.

I finished the draught of a Report from the select Committee on the Smithsonian bequest, but in the process of preparing it changed my purpose from the design of reporting two bills, to that of including the whole subject in one— At the house I presented by leave of the house a petition ofTarr and 179 citizens of Pennsylvania, native americans, praying for an alteration of the naturalization laws to require of 21 years of naturalization, residence for the admission of foreigners to the political rights of native Americans— The petitioners not one of whom is personally known to me requested me in presenting it to the house to give my opinion upon its merits— This required of me a painful operation, for I do not approve the change of the Law petitioned for and know that an odious colouring will be given to the mere presentation of the petition— But I did not feel it becoming in me to refuse to present the petition, nor yet to shrink from the avowal of my opinion against it— I therefore presented the petition, stated the facts and said as the petitioners had chosen to call for my opinion, I felt myself obliged to say that I could not support its prayer— I moved its reference to the judiciary committee. J. W. Brown of Indiana and Hammett of Mississippi moved to lay it on the table which was carried by yeas and nays 128 to 26. Charles J. Ingersoll voted first no, and after the close of the call changed his vote. The Senate this morning concurred with the joint Resolution from the house to close the Session on the 17th. of this month— Willoughby Newton presented a report from the minority of the Committee of elections presented a report on the contested election between the Speaker and Botts—both the reports come to the same conclusion that Jones was duly elected. There was some argument that there was no question left for debate; but after some discussion it was finally concluded to postpone the consideration of the Resolution till next Thursday, and that Botts should if he desired it be heard at the bar in support of his claim— The motion to print the voluminous testimony in the case was laid on the table.— Vance made a motion to take up the bills on the private Calendar—but Cave Johnson moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and prevailed— The Louisiana Land claims—the Dead horses of Georgia, and the establishment of a Navy Yard at Memphis, Tennessee occupied the remainder of the day— Adjourned at half past 4.— Evening visits from Mr Connell, Miss Cutts, Miss Payne and Captain Riotous democratic mass meeting to confirm the nomination of Polk and Dallas.

I had called a final meeting of the select Committee on the Smithsonian bequest, at half past 9 this morning, and yesterday sent round by one of the pages a notification to all the members of the Committee in the house— I had also personally notified George S. Houston—but the only members who attended were Brengle, French, and Yost to whom I read the report and bill that I had prepared, both which they approved and authorised me to present after obtaining the consent of one more member of the Committee, to the house— That consent I afterwards obtained from Emery D. Potter, the member from Ohio— At the house there was an hour’s debate on two Resolutions offered by Parmenter 1. That the daily hour of the meeting henceforth should be 10. O’Clock A.M. 2. That the house should daily take a recess from half past 2 to 4. O’Clock P.M. To which Charles J. Ingersoll offered as an amendment that the house should sit till 8 O Clock every evening— There was no opposition to the first Resolution, which was at last unanimously adopted. But White, Speaker of the last house strenuously opposed the 2d resolution for the daily recess, which he urged experience had proved to be worse than useless waste of time. It was struck out by tellers 65 to 61. Ingersoll’s amendment was declared by the Speaker to be not in order. The motion to adjourn being by a rule of the house always in order. Reding moved that debate should cease on the Memphis Navy-Yard Bill, in one hour after it shall be taken up in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— As he pleaded hard for two hours, and then for an hour and a half which was carried— The private Calendar was then taken up, and 76 private bills were passed— That for Seth Sweetser and that for Francis Casaux were laid on the table and that for H De Peyster laid aside. The house, after several abortive motions to adjourn yielded to one shortly before 5. and at 6. I went and dined with Mr Pakenham the British Minister. I have minuted in the margin the names of all the company at this dinner— Waddy Thompson has just returned from his mission to Mexico, and greeted me, with kindness for Massachusetts of outward cordiality! the snake! Robert C. Winthrop told me he had received a Letter from his relative George W. Erving, relating in part to me, and of which he gave me the general purport, to be remembered. "

Sunday  I received yesterday a printed note of invitation— “Rachel Priestman a minister of the Gospel in the Society of Friends, has appointed a meeting for Divine Worship, to be held in the Capitol to-morrow morning at 11. O’Clock to which thou art respectfully invited.” I attended accordingly. She preached from the Clerk’s table where two men and two women of her company were seated with her.— After sitting about 20 minutes in silence she took off and laid aside her black bonnet and rising began rather suddenly, “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners.” from this text 1 Timothy 1.15. without so naming it, she discoursed nearly an hour in the peculiar canting tone of Quaker Oratory, slow, distinct and loud articulation without a moment’s loss of words, but within almost every sentence, a pause and hitch to take breath, repeating almost every verse in Paul’s epistles impressing the doctrine of Salvation by Faith in Christ Jesus.— Her exhortations were full of unction and intensity— She finished as abruptly as she had begun, and sat down, apparently exhausted— The house was well filled and attentive Some of the auditory thinking the service over began to move, but a man of her company requested them not to depart, and they resumed their Seats. After an interval of about 5 minutes she kneeled and made a fervent affectionate and passionate prayer in behalf of her hearers, not omitting a supplication to God to turn their hearts to dissolve the ties of bondage, and let the oppressed go free After the service was over, she came with her husband I suppose, to my seat and shook hands with me; as did with Mr Giddings a young woman from Ohio namedI walked home. After dinner I attended at Saint John’s Church, where Mr Pine read Evening prayers for Trinity Sunday and another clergyman, a Stranger preached from Psalm 27.8. [“]When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.”— Mr Hawley was not there; though he had been in the morning, and administered the Communion. He is in feeble health; and it is said Mr Pine is already engaged to be settled, as his colleague— President Tyler was there this afternoon. The heat of the day was so intense that I could write little. "

As I was stepping into my carriage this morning to go to the Capitol, I met Mr Giddings with Mr Bigelow, agent for the heirs of Francis Casaux, who were coming to see me. This Casaux claim, now of 67 years standing was before the house last Saturday in the shape of a Bill for the relief of the heirs of Francis Casaux reported by the Committee of the whole and put upon its passage for engrossment. The bill was opposed and I made some remarks expressing my doubts if there was any good foundation for the claim— The Bill was laid on the table— Mr Bigelow came to convince me of the justice of the claim— Mr Giddings having to call at a Department, went on; Mr Bigelow took a seat with me and went with me to the Capitol, reminding me on the way of his application to me as long since as 1832, for my testimony in this case which then or afterwards I gave in writing— Mr Bigelow brought me a report from the late Virgil Maxcy when solicitor of the Treasury; in favour of the claim— A motion was made by Dean of Ohio to reconsider the vote laying the bill on the table, and then the discussion was postponed to Friday, next. Charles J. Ingersoll moved a Resolution for a special assignment of next Monday and Tuesday, for the consideration and determination of such questions as are pending under treaties between the United States and Portugal, the Netherlands and Spain, and the resolution concerning the reciprocity treaties, with Denmark, Sweden, the Hanse-Towns and Great Britain. He dragooned the house into hearing his resolution read— Objections swarmed— He moved a suspension of the rules to enable him to present the Resolution, and called the yeas and nays— Lost 78 and 84— Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, John W. Davis in the Chair on the Civil and Diplomatic appropriation Bill. When it came to the item of Stationary, Pollock moved a proviso that the Stationary should be purchased of American manufactured, and this sprung a debate upon the Presidential election, the Democratic National Convention, Clay, Van Buren, Polk, Tariff, Taxes, Oregon, Mexico, Lord Aberdeen and Democracy. Edward Joy Morris began the chace by denouncing the nomination of James K Polk as the Democratic Candidate for the Presidency. W. W. Payne, John J. Hardin, John P. Hale, Douglas, Schenk and Belser, bandied to and fro the party foot balls, with an episode of insult and defiance between Charles J. Ingersoll and Hale till near 5. O’Clock when the Committee rose and the House adjourned till 10. O’Clock to morrow morning.— I and others had mistaken the adjournment of this morning to be for 10— It was to 11. "

Tuesday  I had promised yesterday to give Mr John Cranch one hour more for him to retouch his portrait of me with which he is not satisfied— But the morning was dark lowering and rainy, and it was half past 9. before I reached the lodge, and Mr Cranch preferred waiting till to-morrow for another sitting to taking of one of half an hour this day.— At the house Charles J. Ingersoll, offered a Resolution calling on the President for all the correspondence with the British Government relating to the exaction by them of duties on rough rice contrary to the Treaty of 1815— There was a snake under this foliage, for Ingersoll said it was harmless.— But Cave Johnson moved an amendment calling for all the documents relating to the Texian Treaty. Ingersoll objected to this amendment and advised and persuaded Johnson to withdraw it till at last he promised that all these Documents shall be communicated to the house, whereupon Cave withdrew his amendment and Ingersoll’s resolution was adopted. M’Kay then moved the Resolution to cease debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union on the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill, and take it out of Committee at 12 O’Clock to-morrow.— There was great pleading by White, Barnard and others to extend the time to Friday or Thursday, or to 4 O’Clock or 2 O’Clock P.M. to all such motions M’Kay stood inflexible, and called the previous question which was sustained and carried— There will of course be not one word of debate on this bill, bearing on the appropriations or having any reference to the bill itself—not one word relevant to the subject before the house. And so it would be if the debate were protracted to the last hour of the Session.— The house then went immediately into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, John W. Davis in the chair George Rathbun took the floor and poured forth an hour of glory and defence upon Martin Van Buren, and of vilification of Henry Clay.— Summers followed on the other side— Then alternately came Houston with M’Clernand, Peyton, Saunders, Bidlack and Foote of Vermont, till near 8. O’Clock in the Evening.— Foote’s speech was the most eloquent and the most decent of them all— Several motions for the Committee to rise were voted down, till twilight came, when on taking the question, upon a motion to rise, the majority voted against rising, but the whole vote was onlyno quorum— The Committee then rose per force and reported no Quorum— A motion to adjourn was rejected— A call of the house was refused by yeas and naysMotions to adjourn to 8 to 6. and to 4 O’Clock to morrow morning were made, till after lights had been brought into the hall—the house adjourned to the usual time.

But M’Kay, chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means moved to suspend the rules and go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and refused to allow me time to present my report and bill— The house went into Committee John W. Davis, in the Chair, and took up the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— Henley Of Indiana had the floor, and made one of the bitterest and most violent speeches against the whigs and Henry Clay that ever delivered in the house— He spoke of Pollock’s amendment requiring stationary of American Manufacture, as a species of whig humbuggery, which was an insult to the American People, and when called by name on the yeas and nays taken on this amendment he voted for it.— The temper of the Speech was in full keeping with its conclusion, which was the Standard of Henry Clay should consist of his armorial bearings, which ought to be, a pistol, a pack of cards and a brandy bottle— Tibbatts took the last house of the debate, allowing only ten minutes of it to Thomasson to back him in a motion to appropriate 550000 dollars to purchase a remnant of Stock in the Louisville, and Portland Canal to make it toll free— At 12 O’Clock the debate ceased and the voting commenced on the amendments, and continued till past 4. many of which were rejected, and a few were adopted— Pratt chairman of the Committee on the public buildings and grounds, moved a whole bill of amendments, usually presented in a separate bill; and I moved as an amendment to this amendment an item of 1000 dollars to erect in the Congressional burying ground a monument over the remains of the late Major General Alexander Macomb. The chairman decided Pratt’s amendment and mine to be in order and out of order three or four times, and finished by admitting Pratt’s items one by one, and excluding mine when the bill was reported to the house. Tibbatts renewed his motion for an appropriation to purchase the canal Stock—but the Speaker ruled it out of order.— The house then adjourned— Commander Wilkes, with the Revd Mr. Scoresby and a Mr Mayer spent the Evening with us. My wife received a Letter from our Son, of 2. June, safe home at Boston. [symbols] "

Instead of two lines, I wrote 24. but when written, I was unwilling to let them go from my own hands— They were utterly unfit to be read, and so it is nine times out of ten with lines which I am requested to write— I was unable to reach the lodge in time to give Mr Cranch a sitting for my portrait.— At the house Duncan had made a motion to the general appropriation bill, of an amendment to the item for refurnishing the President’s house, that no part of the appropriation should be applied to the purchase of wine— This was meant as a sly insinuation against H. Clay. But Hamlin had taken fire, and moved a Committee of enquiry to ascertain when and by whom, wine had ever been purchased under the name of furniture—but Pratt chairman of the Committee on the public buildings and grounds declared that he had examined all the accounts and that no such charge had ever been made.— Hammett made enquiry whether any answer had been received from the call heretofore made by Dixon H. Lewis for documents relating to the negotiations with Spain in 1816, 17. 18 and 19.— But the answer has not yet been received— The Reports, Majority and minority on the contested election between the Speaker and John M. Botts had been made the special order of this day.— Both the reports were in favour of Jones; but a Resolution had passed that Botts should be heard in support of his claim to the seat if he desired.— The first question was whether the competitors in arguing their claims should be limited by the hour rule, and after much debate it was decided by yeas and nays that they should be— The acting Speaker, Weller so decided— Garret Davis appealed from the decision— Cobb moved to lay the appeal on the table. Carried—102 to 76. I spoke against this construction of the rule.— Botts and Jones addressed the house for one hour, and they were both arrested without closing their argument— Elmer, chairman of the Committee then spoke in support of the Resolution declaring Jones duly elected and entitled to his Seat.— After which there was some jarring between Willougby Newton and Hannibal Hamlin, members of the Committee—and the vote by nominal call was answered 150 in the affirmative—none in the negative— The civil and diplomatic appropriation bill was then debated till 5. and the house adjourned. Evening call from Dr Brewer My wife, with Mrs Smith, Mrs John Adams and Mary Louisa went to a concert. "

At the house, M’Kay called for the consideration of the civil and diplomatic, and the navy appropriation bills, and Vance, chairman of the committee of claims, expressed a willingness to pass over the private bills for this day, upon condition that they shall be taken up to-morrow. But he pleaded for a short slip of time to call for the reports of Committees. Cave Johnson called on the Speaker, for a Letter from Charles A. Wickliffe Postmaster General, referring to a charge against him for official malversation, made on the 20th. of last Month, by Garret Davis, declaring the charge in every sense untrue, and that he is prepared to prove it so; and demanding an enquiry by order of the house. Garrett Davis said that he had stated the facts, and was prepared to prove them all true. As to the guilt of the Postmaster, he left that to be inferred from the facts which he had stated; and if Mr Wickliffe wanted enquiry as to the facts stated by him he was perfectly willing, and even to extend the enquiry to other charges against the Postmaster General, of similar character.— Cave the moved to refer the Letter to the Committee of Post-Offices and Post-Roads, with Liberty to send for persons and papers. Cave slyly observed that Garrett Davis’s charge this day was a little different from that which he had made before. Davis demanded in what particular it differed, and Cave had no reply to make.— His motion to refer the charges to the Committee of Post Offices and Post-roads was adopted, but Davis’s motion to extend the enquiry was lost.— M’Kay reported the bill-making appropriations for the unlawful naval expenditures— I moved to lay the bill on the table—lost—ayes 45.— It was referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union; where Barnard told me he wanted to debate it— Burke made a voluminous report from the Select Committee on the Rhode Island Rebellion, and moved that it be printed and postponed to the first Monday, in December next, which, after some debate it was carried, with agreement that a minority report, promised by Causin shall also be printed— I presented the report and Bill from the select Committee on the Smithsonian bequest, which were referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and ordered to be printed— The civil and diplomatic, and the Navy Appropriation Bills were taken up, and driven through, and just before 5. O’Clock the house adjourned MrColton, the author of Tecumseh—brought me a Letter of recommendation from Rufus Choate, and spent the Evening with me. Mrs John Adams and her daughter Mary-Louisa went to an Evening party at Commander Wilkes’s. "

At the house Hopkins chairman of the Committee on Post-Offices and Post roads gave notice that he would next Monday move to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the Post-Office bills, of which there are three— One from the Senate; one from the majority and one from the minority of the house Committee, each accompanied with a Bill and based upon antagonistical principles. All agree that some modification of the existing system is indispensable, or the general post Office will be ruined.— Newton moved that Mr Botts and the Speaker should have leave respectively to withdraw each for himself the testimony which he had produced before the Committee of Elections—but objections were made an amendment was first moved that they should have leave to take copies; and then it was remarked that they had a right to take copies without needing a resolution of the house and the motion was laid on the table.— Garrett Davis renewed the question he had yesterday made what Cave Johnson had meant by saying that his charge against the Postmaster General yesterday was different from that which he had made, and upon which Mr. Wickliffe by his Letter to the Speaker demanded investigation— Wickliffe’s Letter alledges that Davis had positively charged him with sending his agent into Davis’s district to interfere in the election against Davis and for his competitor, Wickliffe’s nephew— Davis had stated facts leading to that conclusion, and said he left the house to draw their own conclusion— Cave Johnson rather retreated from the discussion and Davis moved a suspension of the rules for a Resolution of enquiry by the Post-Office Committee generally of malversation by the Postmaster General. The suspension of the rules was refused 60 to 66— The house passed two bills relating to affairs of the district, and laid on the table several others passed the grant to the heirs of Casaux, carried the previous question for the Louisiana land bill, and then adjourned— After dinner at the President’s grounds.

I attended this morning with my family, at St. Johns Church, where Mr Pine read the morning service for the first Sunday after Trinity, and Mr Scoresby preached from Isaiah 5.3. [“]And now, O, inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard 4. What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?” There is a singular transition from the third to the first person in the narrative of this wild but beautiful allegory. This seeming grammatical confusion is characteristic of the style of the Hebrew prophets and especially of Isaiah— This chapter is one of the most fearful predictions of the destruction of the two kingdoms of Israel and of Judah in the whole book of the Scriptures. With regard to the application of the text to the time and place, some question occurred to me of the propriety of the selection.— If this Country was to be considered as the vineyard of the Lord, for which he had done so much; all that could be done, and the vineyard had brought forth pernicious fruit instead of good fruit, was it for a stranger just landed on our shores then to use the language of reproach and the menace of destruction— But the preacher dealt to day only in generalities, expostulated only with individuals, and avoided all offensive imputations The boundless bounties of the Creator and the graceless ingratitude of the desperately wicked human heart was a theme upon which it was easy to expatiate at large— Mr Scoresby’s manner is earnest without extravagant, his composition grave and impressive, his pronunciation all English— Mr Hawley announced the death of Mrs Harrison Smith last Friday, and her funeral this day at one O’Clock. My family attended— I called at Fuller’s and returned the visit of Waddy Thompson, but he was out. Notice was given by Mr Hawley that this afternoon and henceforth for the Season, the evening service would commence at 5. O’Clock— But at 4. I attended at the second Presbyterian Church and heard Mr James Knox from Ecclesiastes 4.13 [“]Better is a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king”—leaving out the words, “who will no more be admonished”— It was a Sabbath School Sermon, abundantly democratic, and a collection was taken up for the Society— Mr Moseley of H.R, Mr Cutts and his daughter and a Mr Johnson of New-York passed the Evening here.

I record this vote as a deliverance, I trust by the special interposition of almighty God, of my Country, and of human Liberty, from a conspiracy comparable to that of Lucius Sergius Catilina— May it prove not a mere temporary deliverance, like that only preliminary to the fatally successful conspiracy of Julius Caesar— The annexation of Texas to this Union is the first step to the conquest of all Mexico, of the West India Islands, of a maritime colonizing slavery tainted monarchy, and of extinguished freedom.  At the house, Woodward was allowed to present resolutions of a meeting in South Carolina in favour of the annexation of Texas, and David L.

Barnard moved an amendment, more explicitly declaring than M’Kay had done in his bill that almost the whole of these expenditures had been incured not only without authority of Law but in defiance of Law.— Barnard was followed by Ezra Dean, one of the rankest radicals in the house, who pronounced a philippic of an hour upon all parties, upon the last and the present Congress, interspersed with special venomous thrusts at the whigs—bewailing his disappointment in the expectation of reforms, and declaring that he would henceforth never take? the name of reform from in any other sense than as a humbug with unmitigated contempt— M’Kay commenced the defence of his bill, but was interrupted by the time for recess. I went and dined with Kennedy and Winthrop.— It was 5. O’Clock when we returned to the house— The naval appropriation bill supplementary had been resumed. Mr Barnard’s amendment was adopted; and the bill was passed.— The penal post-office bill was taken up in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Hamlin Chairman; after a vote to take it out of Committee in 5. minutes.— D. D. Barnard asked leave to present, and moved to suspend the rules for 2 Resolutions of censure—upon Tyler’s usurpations— Suspension refused by yeas and nays 56 to 123.— The Light house bill—Army Appropriation Bill, Western Land sales bill, and Georgia dead horse bill, were successively taken up, and buffeted along in Committee and in the house till half past ten at night when the house adjourned, and I came home "

                "text": "14. V. Friday.  There was steady rain almost the whole day of yesterday and great part of last Night; and this day was of a temperature more congenial to October than to June. Dr. Laurie called on me this morning and renewed his solicitation for my interference, to obtain from the President of Mexico Santa Anna the release of Dr. William M. Shepherd a prisoner taken at Mier and confined in the Castle of Perote— I repeated a promise I had made before on receiving Dr Laurie’s Letter of 23 April last, that if Peace with Mexico should be restored, I would appeal to the humanity of General Santa Anna in behalf of Dr Shepherd and others of the Prisoners taken at Mier— Mr Waddy Thompson had already requested my good offices for them. At the house, this was the second of the last days of agonising confusion usual at the close of a Session of Congress.— It passes a spunge upon my memory, so that it is impossible to record the course of business, and can notice only a few of the incidents of the day.— There have been majority and minority reports from the Burke’s select Committee on the Rhode-Island memorial— Burke failed this day in a motion to print 5000 copies of his incendiary report.— Upon a Senate Bill to fix the Northern boundary of Missouri Augustus Dodge the delegate from the territory of Iowa hitched in an amendment authorising the People of that territory to form a State Government, with a surface of more than 100000 square miles.— The plundering Louisiana land claim bill was earnestly opposed, by Samuel F. Vinton, until the hour of the recess when I came home and dined— A message was received from the President with a large budget of the correspondence of George W. Erving in Spain from 1815 to 1819. not heretofore made public— It was the answer, to the call of the house, moved by Dixon H. LewisApril before his transfer to the Senate— I cursorily read over the papers and found abundant evidence to falsify the pretension of George W. Erving that he could have negotiated a boundary, even to the Colorado; but his instructions were not included in D. H. Lewis’s call.— This afternoon I asked leave to present a Resolution calling on the President for them— Reding objected— I moved and carried a suspension of the rules, and the Resolution was adopted— The Louisiana land claim bill, after a stubborn struggle was passed by yeas and nays 86 to 84. a reconsideration was afterwards moved, but the bill had been sent to the Senate, and White objected that in such case there could be no reconsideration. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Hopkins in the chair The amendments of the Senate to the civil and diplomatic, army, Indian and pension bills, were discussed, and reported to the house, which adjourned after 11. at night.

Brown came this morning with a deed of release to him of his mortgage given as security upon his note for 1000 dollars taken by me in March 1842 in part payment of the debt of the Columbian College to me— On the 13th of last Month he paid the note-principal and interest in full and took it up with the mortgage.— In addition to this, a deed of release from the mortgagee is customary here; and I executed and acknowledged this one before two magistrates E. F. Brown, and James Lawrenson who came with him— I found the house in a chaos of confusion with two stupid resolutions against a bank of the United States reported from the Committee of elections by Chesselden Ellis, one of the weakest and most worthless turncoats in the house— They had been sprung this morning without notice or consultation with the minority of the Committee of Elections, and by the screw of the previous question moved by Ellis, were crammed down with the yeas and nays 108 to 68— A meaner and more despicable fraud was never perpetrated— There was something of consolation in what followed— Charles J. Ingersoll rose and without making any motion insinuated that the journal of 31. May required amendment.— It was there stated that I had presented a petition from citizens of Pennsylvania for an alteration of the naturalization Laws, and that it had been laid on the table— Since then he had received many Letters enquiring into the facts, and upon applying to the Clerk had been told that the petition had been withdrawn by me— If the petition was not on the clerk’s table, the Journal ought no to show that it had been laid there— The Petition was in my draw.— I took it out, held it up and said that in my anxiety to have it referred to the Committee, after enquiring of the Clerk whether it could not be so referred from the table without new application to the house and being informed that it could not I had borrowed it yesterday for the express purpose of moving that it be taken up and referred to the judiciary committee, which now I did.— The Speaker said could only be entertained by universal consent. I asked it.— Charles faintly said he saw no reason that it should not be referred— Reding objected— I moved a suspension of the rules and carried it by an overwhelming shout. Opposition slunk into silence, and the petition was referred to the judiciary committee— The same petition which 16 days ago by yeas and nays 128 to 24 refused to refer it, and laid it on the table— Ingersoll has raised a hornet’s nest about his ears by his double vote first against and then for laying the petition on the table. He has published a Letter to his constituents of the 4th. Congressional District of Pennsylvania to account for his double vote— His chief reasons are that the other Pennsylvania members save two, voted as he did at last, and that the petition was presented by me— He did not like the [“]auspices.”— While the house was in its Babel state this morning, I went for a long hour into the Senate chamber where I found George M’Duffie, closing a violent and rancorous speech against Thomas Hart Benton, and his bill for the annexation of Texas— The bill was already laid on the table; but M’Duffie had obtained leave to answer Benton’s speech on introducing his bill— M’Duffie’s speech was unsparing upon Benton; and his reply of about one hour was so merciless and personal, that nothing but bodily fear, could have withheld the hand of M’Duffie from a challenge— But he put up with it, quiet as a lamb— I returned to the house where the Louisiana land bill, return from the Senate at the request of the house, was reconsidered, and after a metamorphosis, striking out all but one section it was passed and sent to the Senate again— From half past 2 to 4. O’Clock P.M. I came home and dined, and returned to the house— During the whole day and till after midnight the appropriation bills, civil and diplomatic, army-navy and Indian were time after time before the house, in and out of Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon amendments pending between the two houses and reports of Committees of conferences on disagreeing votes— In almost every instance the house finished by receding, as they did without one exception from all their retrenchments Though M’Kay had sworn to me that he would lose the civil and diplomatic, and the army bill sooner than give up the retrenchments which his Committee had introduced into them and which the house had sanctioned but after a second conference, he gave them all up, and the house submitted.— Ashe of Tennessee carried through a bill for establishing a naval depot at Memphis in that State against the opposition of the Mississippi and Louisiana, who wanted it in their own States— The whigs helped Ashe through.— The Cumberland Road, the bill to extend the Charters of the District Banks, and multitudes of private bills were urged upon the house in most admired disorder, one against the other, and by perpetual motions to suspend the rules rejected by yeas and nays or by tellers.— About 10 at Night conflict commenced between the District bank bill, and private bills, all at the third reading and under the previous question— Motions for a call of the house and to adjourn were followed up in alternate succession and always with demand for yeas and nays— Shortly before midnight R B Rhett moved to adjourn, and said that whether the house should adjourn or not, he would retire as the sabbath should commence— A motion to adjourn at 4 minutes past 12 was rejected— I desired that the time might be minuted on the journal— Soon after 2. the Senate adjourned— 20 minutes past 3 a motion to adjourn was made, and on the call of my name I answered no and fell asleep till E. R. Potter roused me and told me the house was adjourned "

There was no public worship in the hall of the house of Representatives this day— At St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley, Mr Smith Pyne engaged as his colleague or assistant, and Dr Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright of New-York were all present in Priest’s robes, and divided the morning services between them— Mr Pyne read the ordinary prayers and collects— Dr Wainwright the Litany and Communion and Mr Hawley gave out the notices.— Dr Wainwright preached a very excellent Sermon, from Proverbs 23.26, first part of the verse. [“]My Son, give me thy heart.”— The discourse commenced with an exemplification of the various senses in which the heart is used in the scriptures to indicate the properties of the human character— He quoted sundry passages of Scriptures in which the heart is significant of the understanding of the judgment of the Memory, of the Imagination, of the affections, and he might have added of the vices— The wisest of men does not appear to have analyzed the compound man, so as to discriminate between the operations of the intellect and of the affections— In the chapter from which this text was taken, is successively used to signify the seat of thought of deception, of wisdom of envy and of joy.— Jesus declared the first commandment to be, thou shall love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy mind—that is with the affections, the intellect and the will— Solomon includes all in the heart— In this text the heart, Dr Wainwright thinks means exclusively the affections, and he builds upon it a theory that the first avenue to all religious Faith is through the senses— This must be true—but neither Trinity nor transubstantiation can be traced to this— After the morning service I had a visit from Daniel D. Barnard to take leave; and a long conversation with him— This Texas annexation we deem the turning point of a resolution which transforms the North-American Confederation into a conquering and warlike Nation. Aggrandizement will be its passion and its policy— A military Government, a large army, a costly Navy, distant Colonies, and associate islands in every sea will follow of course in rapid succession—a President for four years will be a laughing stock. A Captain General for life and a Marshal’s truncheon for a Scepter will establish the law of arms for the constitution, and the skeleton forms of War and Slavery will stalk unbridled over the land.— Blessed God deliver us from this fate!— After dinner Mr Pyne and Mr Hawley jointly performed the service, 2d. Sunday after Trinity— Mr Pyne preached from 2. Corinthians 7.10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. "

Moloch and Mammon have sunk into momentary slumber— The Texas Treason is blasted for the hour, and the first Session of the most perverse and worthless Congress that ever disgraced this confederacy has closed. This last day from 10 in the morning till Noon was a continuation of tumult from the adjournment of yesterday morning. The joint Resolution of the two houses, had fixed the adjournment, by their respective presiding Officers at 12 O’Clock Meridian this day. There were numerous bills public and private still pending before them both, and the 17th. joint rule forbids the sending of any bill to the President for his approbation on the last day of the Session— This rule was rescinded and bills were sent to him and signed by him at least until the moment of adjournment. A printed notice signed by three lawyers, counsel for the 3 city banks, was laid on the tables of the members, stating that if Congress should not act on the bill for extending the charters, on their expiration, 4 July next they would be without power to recover any debts due to them— Campbell, chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia succeeded after a hard struggle in introducing a bill, which he called a compromise, giving the banks power after the expiration of their charters to prosecute and recover debts due to them, and making them accountable for their own, which bill was carried through and signed by the President— The inflexibility of the house against rechartering the banks, is said to have been wrought by the two brothers Carroll, one a whig member from the 29th district of New-York, and the other Clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court, and who is said to have a debt of his own of 20000 dollars to one of the City banks.— The Senate passed a Resolution to postpone the adjournment till two O’Clock, and while it was under discussion, in the House, the yeas and nays were called; in the midst of which call, the minute hand of the clock, pointing precisely at 12. the Speaker stop’d the call—declared the house adjourned without day, and left the chair. No Messages between the houses— No farewell to the President, and the members dispersed to their respective places of abode— Gilbert Livingston Thompson the Messenger sent to Mexico to snuff the scent of the Texian annexation Treaty there, returned this day, and reports that Santa Anna is ready and willing to treat for the cession of Texas to the United States. In the course of the day, I had visits from Mr George H. Colson, from the Revd. Dr Miller, and from Mr Connell, to take leave. "

In the midst of the hurly burly of a closing session of Congress, a scene always sufficient to discompose the serenity of a steadier mind than mine, I have been distracted with multiplied applications for autographs and lines in Albums, which it would be ungracious and would be thought churlish to refuse, and yet with which it is insupportable to comply.— For many years I have occasionally written knacks, trifles, nosegays in the scrapbooks of my younger relatives, for which I have but a wretched talent, and inginuety could seldom save me from compliance— I once attempted to make a collection of these nugae albae; but I sickened at the sight of most of them and I gave it up.— A quarto volume, price ten dollars was published a few weeks since called the United States Album, with copperplate engravings of the arms of all the States in the Union, and fac-simile signatures of the President, of all the members of both houses of Congress, and of all the judges of the Supreme Court, and then blank leaves to be written upon.— A. H. Stephens of Georgia, Joshua R. Giddings of Ohio and Hamilton Fish, have each a copy of this book, and asked me to write my name and a few lines in them, and there I was straining from hard bound brains senseless rhymes, like the slipshod Sybil in lofty madness meditating song.— I went this morning to the Capitol, returned the volume of Dupuis which I had borrowed for Dr Todsen from the congress Library, and took out the 5th. volume of Thompson’s Alcedo.— Dr Muller Pastor of a Congregation of English Lutherans had invited me to attend at the ceremony of laying the corner stone of a Church last Thursday.— I was that day engaged at the house, but the weather was bad, and the ceremony was postponed to this day. Dr. Muller came yesterday and repeated the invitation to me to attend. Accordingly at 3 O’Clock this afternoon I went to the City Hall, and thence walked in procession of clergymen, church council of St. Paul’s congregation, teachers and pupils of the Sunday school; the Officers of the Grand Lodge of the Grand Lodge District of Columbia in full Regalia; the Sons of Temperance Society, and multitudes of boys, escorted by the Marine band, to the corner of H and 11th. Street, where the corner stone was laid of the English Lutheran Church of St. Paul’s.— There was a disgusting alliance of religious ceremonies with Masonic Mummery, but not a word could be heard of the address of the Grand Master who laid the corner Stone— The heat was excessive.

IV:30 Wednesday—  It sometimes happens at sea, that in the midst of a hurricane, the wind falls instantly into a flat calm, the sea still running mountain high— Ships in that condition are in extreme danger of rolling their masts overboard, and experienced mariners have told me, they dreaded such a condition more than the heaviest gale of wind— Such is my present. My attention to public affairs is absorbed in the preparations for settling my debts here, and in looking up the documents for the 2d. and third Sessions of the 27th. Congress, one set of each of which I am to pack up in a chest and send round by water to Boston— The Documents are now divided into three sets of 1. Executive Documents of the House. 2. Reports of Committees of the House 3. Senate Documents, including Executive and Reports— Then one Volume of Journals of Each house—and a Folio Volume or two of printed Bills and Amendments— I doubt if another member of Congress besides myself preserves an entire set of all these papers. Of the Bills no one condescends to keep a set After the close of each Session, every member of each house is entitled to receive bound one set of what are called the Session Documents, and one copy of the Journal of each house. But not of the Bills— During the Session each member has a copy of every printed document, and of every sheet of the Journals of both houses laid on his table fresh printed—these, like sybil leaves are scattered and destroyed from day to day— My practice is to have them kept in files for me, including the printed bills, and after the close of the Session to have them bound at my own expence— I have thus one set of the Documents here, and one at my home in Quincy. But many of the voluminous Documents are not printed till long after the close of the Session to which they belong. I found my sets of documents of both the second and third Sessions of the 27th. Congress incomplete and called at the Intelligencer and Globe Offices, and at the Clerk’s Office H.R.U.S. to rectify mistakes. French the Subclerk was gone to dinner, and I did not wholly discover where the error was, but am on its track.— I found by conversation with Gales, that Gilbert L. Thompson’s reports from Mexico were shameless lies, and that instead of Santa-Annas readiness to negotiate for the cession of Texas he took immediate measures for the most determined resistance. Treachery of the deepest infamy marks every step of this Jackson project for the dismemberment of Mexico and the perpetuation of Slavery from its inception to this day. It is yet portentous beyond conception— Mr Garrett Davis paid me a visit to take leave— He told me he was going home to Kentucky, and should return here in about 3 weeks, devoting the summer to an electioneering campaign.— Mrs W. S. Smith left us last Evening, and returned to Mr Frye’s. "

Spencer, was President or Chairman of a whig association in the State of New-York and called an indignation meeting of whigs against Tyler at Syracuse— Before that meeting was held on the 12th. of October 1841. Mr Spencer was appointed by Mr Tyler Secretary of War, which Office he accepted and held, till March 7. 1843 when he was appointed Secretary of the Treasury— During the recent Session of Congress he was nominated a judge of the Supreme Court and on the 31st. of January last was rejected by the Senate. Since then, he resigned his office as Secretary of the Treasury, for which no reason has been made public; and on the last day of the Session of the Senate, was again nominated as judge of the Supreme Court, and again rejected— Mrs Morris’s husband was a clerk in the Treasury department while her father was the Secretary, and retires with him— I have little acquaintance with this Lady, but she has been very courteous to my wife and family, and earnestly solicitous that I would write some verses addressed to her— I did write a couple of Stanzas which puzzled me in the composition not a little— For I began with a line of seven syllables and in following out the verse fell unconsciously into the blunder of mingling 7 and 8 syllable lines together— I discovered it only by the want of harmony in the lines upon reading them over— I never before the peculiar property of the seven syllable line, which consists in the uniform location of the accent and emphasis on the first syllable of each line— The inadvertent admission of a word accented on the second syllable, changes the measure to the eight syllable verse, and the mixture of the two measures produces dissonance— It took me hours to Procrustesize my lines to Mrs Morris— She was here this day with Miss Paine, when I was out.— Miss Paine left word that I must not write any more verses for ladies— I proceeded in the assortment of my documents for the second and third Sessions of the 27th. Congress, visiting for that purpose, the Globe and Intelligencer Offices and the Clerk’s Office of the house. The bookbinder of the Globe had bound the five volumes of my Reports of Committees 27 Congress 2. Session in 6. whereby the contents of each volume did not correspond with the index.— French gave me in Exchange for the set, one duly bound.— He gave me also a set of the Senate Documents of the same Session which had not been delivered to me— Much of the day was consumed in settling accounts and paying off bills— Towards evening I rode with my wife daughter and granddaughter to the Eastern front yard of the Capitol, and heard the music of the marine band— Met there W. S. Archer, Senator from Virginia. Also William and John Cranch— The heat of the weather breeds idleness. "

Sessions of the 27th. Congress, still absorb my time, and delay the recovery of my arrears of Diary run up during the last days of the Session of Congress— The National Intelligencer of this day has my Letter of 18. May last to Mrs Sarah H. Butler President of the Ladies of the Wyoming Monumental Association at Wilkesbarre Pennsylvania—and I found it also, both in the Boston Courier and Daily Advertiser which came this day. I called again at the Office of the National Intelligencer, and obtained a copy of the paper of 7. June containing the fifth List of petitions presented by me to the House of Representatives at the first Session of the 28th. Congress, with the disposal of them by the house— The preceding lists are in the papers of 28. December 1843. 10 and 29. February and 5. April 1844— This last of 7. June contains also the Memorial of Edward Jarvis, William Brigham, and J. Wingate Thornton, the Committee of the American statistical association, demonstrating a multitude of gross and important errors in the printed Census of 1840.— On the 19th. of February last I had stated to the then Secretary of State Upshur that there were numerous errors in the printed census, and proved to him by inspection of the census itself the error of the return of 133 insane coloured persons in the town of Worcester, Massachusetts— On the 26th. of that month, the house at my motion, adopted a call upon the Secretary of State for a report whether any such material errors existed, and if so what had been done to correct them— The journal of the house of 4. May (p 887) states that the Speaker laid before the house a Letter from the Secretary of State (John C. Calhoun) in answer to the Resolution of 26. February, “stating that no such errors had been discovered”— On the 6th of May I moved to amend the journal of the 5th by striking out the words “and stating that no such errors had been discovered”— My motion was lost, by yeas and nays 32 to 126— On the preceding 18th. of April the same Secretary of State John C. Calhoun, in an official Letter to the British Minister Pakenham had drawn out an elaborate argument from these same falsified returns of the census as if they were uncontroverted truths, to justify the annexation Treaty with Texas.— On the 16th of May I moved a suspension of the rules to enable me to present this memorial, to the house and the yeas and nays on my motion were 93 to 47. The Speaker’s vote would have carried the two thirds required to suspend the rules; he declared it lost for lack of two thirds. I asked if he had voted he said he had not, and if he had it would have been in the negative— The next day I entered the memorial under the rule and it was referred to the Committee on Statistics whose Chairman Zadok Pratt promised me that they would report upon it; but they did not. At the house this day I obtained a copy of the House Journal 27. Congress 2 Session. "

Mr William Emmons came and took back the volume of Boston Orations which he had lent me some months since, and of which he proposes to publish a new edition. Mr Lewis Johnson came and read to me a Letter from his Counsel Moffitt advising him to remit to the Administrator of Nathaniel Otis at New-Orleans the portion of William Otis’s Assets which would have been due to him if now living, leaving to the administrator to distribute the amount due to each of his heirs according to Lex Loci, in Louisiana— This I think right. Mr Johnson requested me to call again upon the first Comptroller and urge his decision upon the question of remaining interest on the claim of William Otis, which I promised to— I went accordingly to the Treasury Department, but the first comptroller was not at his office— I applied to Michael Nourse, Chief Clerk of the Register’s Office as Co Executor of Ward Nicholas Boylston’s Will, for payment of two unclaimed dividends standing in his name—one of 67 dollars and 88 cents, from the Loan-Office book of Rhode-Island upon interest due in 1802–3 and 4. and the other, of 21 dollars 66 cents from the books of Massachusetts, and due in 1795— William Dayton Lewis 71. Cedar Street New York, had given notice of these two claims, by Letters of 9 and 23. May last to Nathaniel Curtis my Co-Executor, which Mr. Curtis had enclosed to me. I enquired if I could receive these dividends by virtue of the power of Attorney produced by me lastand upon which I received the dividend standing in the name of Lee, George Erving and Latham. Mr Nourse found that power, which did not include these dividends, but he paid them on my signing receipts there, for as Co-Executor, and promising to produce at my convenience authentic evidence of my right in that capacity.— He gave me an order on the cashier of the Bank of the Metropolis for 89 dollars 54 cents.— I had already called at that Bank, and exchanged for its bills 227. dollars 95 cents for 47 English Sovereigns which I had received there last Monday.— I went to the Globe Office—settled my bill there, and ascertained that the binder has my documents of the 27th. Congress 3. Session, from the document room to be bound— After dinner just before the setting of the Sun, I walked to the Presidents grounds, and heard the music of the Marine band— I met there Mr Smith Pyne, now assistant preacher with Mr Hawley at St. John’s Church. After which I paid a visit to Mrs Madison; who was going out; and lastly to Mrs Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, who has a soirée every Saturday evening. Mrs Tayloe once Julia Dickinson of Troy New-York, is literary and the pink of fashion— She shewed me three separate Albums, one of which contains autograph Letters from many of our revolutionary worthies.

I attended public worship this morning alone at the second Presbyterian church, where Mr Knox preached from Luke 10.42— “But one thing is needful.” He premised this discourse with a narrative of the circumstances under which these words were spoken— The peculiar relation of tender affection between Jesus and this whole family of Martha, Mary and Lazarus— Then the incident which gave occasion to the remark, the extraordinary solicitude of Martha for the entertainment of her guests— Her call upon Jesus to bid her sister give some attention and assistance to the duties of hospitality, and the mild and gentle rebuke of Jesus to Martha for her excessive anxiety for mere worldly concerns with his approbation of Mary for adhering to the one thing needful, Religion. he proceeded with an earnest and affectionate exhortation to his hearers to apply to themselves that solemn injunction to every Christian, to devote himself and all his faculties to the one thing needful— Mr Knox read the whole of the 10th. chapter of Luke, which besides this account of the visit of Jesus to the house of Martha, contains also the question of the lawyer what he should do to inherit eternal life; and the answer of Jesus referring him to the Law—and asking how he reads the law? The lawyer replies Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind— The words, and with all thy strength, are here additional to the same saying as reported in Matthew 22.30. whether the illustration of the meaning of the term neighbour by the parable of the good Samaritan is not included— As I came out of the church I was accosted by Mr Fillebrown who told me that his father always a firm and good friend of mine died last week at the age of 81. He lived at Winthrop in the State of Maine.— This afternoon I attended with my family at St. John’s church where Mr Pyne read the evening service for the third Sunday after Trinity, and preached from Matthew 7.20— [“]By their fruits ye shall know them.” He began by observing that the judgment of the world was apt to require too much of Christianity by making it responsible for the faults and errors of its votaries— After some preliminary remarks he divided the discussion of his subject into three parts 1. What the world may justly expect from professing Christians 2. What it does require of them and 3. The practice incumbent on them in the fulfilment of their duties. He confined himself now to the first and second points, leaving the third for hereafter I walked this evening to Mr Gurley’s but Mr Davis was out. "

Seymour on the question of reconsideration upon the reconsideration of the Eastern harbour Bill, after the veto—that evinced any want of good faith or calculated to defeat a constitution at two thirds vote to pass the bill— Mr Seymour has been charged with this in a Troy newspaper, and Mr Davis, his neighbour and friends wants testimony to refute the Slander. Mr Davis was lodging at Mr Gurley’s on Pennsylvania avenue, and wrote me that he proposed to leave the City for home this day. I called last Evening at Mr Gurley’s to see him but he was out. He came here this morning, and I told him that before answering his Letter, I wished to see the Article in the Troy Newspaper containing the charge against Mr Seymour, but he had it not, and could state only the general purport of it. I told him that I could readily and cheerfully certify that I never for an instant entertained a suspicion of insincerity on the part of Mr Seymour, when the Speaker by what I thought a shameful collusion, cut off all reconsideration of the Eastern harbour bill, by deciding that the main question upon the previous question moved by Mr Seymour, applied to the passages of the bill, when not five minutes before Seymour had moved the previous question only upon an assurance from Linn Boyd, then in the Speaker’s chair that the main question would be on Seymour’s motion to postpone the reconsideration of the Bill from Tuesday to Thursday— This was a knave’s trick. I remonstrated against it in vain. If Mr Seymour had resented it vehemently I believe he would have shamed the Speaker out of it and the bill might have passed by a two thirds vote— Mr David L. Seymour was embarrassed by his reluctance to break with his Southern democratic allies; and submitted to the iniquitous decision of the Speaker which smothered all reconsideration of the bill. Mr Davis in substance admitted all this, and will be satisfied with my testimony to my belief in the sincerity of Mr Seymour— I was hard worked all this day in retrieving my arrears of diary run up in the last days of the Session— Towards Evening I walked to Mr Frye’s expecting to find my family there, but was disappointed— I found there however Mr and Mrs Moody with their infant daughter recently recovered from the scarlet fever— Walter Hellen was also there. I asked Mr Frye for a statement of his accounts as my agent here, and came home with Mr and Mrs Moody in their carriage— "

I repeated the enquiry concerning the Documents required by the Government of Massachusetts from that of the Province of New Brunswick. He said the pressure of other business in the Department had delayed the renewed demand upon the British Minister for these papers, which he said he proposed to make next week— I then enquired about a memorial of James Crosby, and 90 others addressed to him and a printed copy of which has been sent to me.— It complains of enactments of duties by the Legislature of the Province in contravention to an article of the Ashburton Treaty— He said there was no doubt that it was a plain violation of the Treaty— And on this also he should address Mr Pakenham— My last enquiry was whether the call of the House of Representatives adopted at my motion on Friday the 14th. of this months, for the Instructions to George W. Erving in 1814 and afterwards during his mission to Spain had been answered— Mr Markoe told me that the Resolution of the house had not been received—another of the Clerks said it was not received until two hours after the final adjournment of the house, so that it cannot be answered till the next Session of Congress.— But Mr Calhoun immediately offered to send to my house for my inspection the two folio of manuscript Volumes of Instructions to the Ministers of the United States in Europe—which I accepted— And in the Letter of Instruction from James Monroe Secretary of State of 30.

He told me candidly that he did not think what he had seen of this Country, equal to Nova Scotia— The town of Cornwallis, is one of the most fertile spots in the province; a great portion of it having been reclaimed from the Sea— I continued my preparations for departure, and returned to the Congress Libraries, books which I had taken out to use.

I went in the Barouche to my old favourite spot—found the tide unusually high— All my station rocks occupied by young men, except one, and that surrounded by the tide, already upon the ebb.— I had some difficulty to undress and dress, but got my bath—swam about 5 minutes, and came out, washed and refreshed— It was my exercise for the day— After returning home I did not again pass the sill of the street door— I continued the process of packing up books and papers to send to Quincy— I found the blue chests N. 11. and 14 with their keys, and another, blue chest without key or number.— The chest furnished me by the Postmaster of the house holds not half the books and documents accumulated in the second and third Session of the 27th. Congress— On opening the blue chest N. 11. and the one unnumbered which had not been opened for several years, I found a mass of old Letters and secret documents of which I must if life and health be indulged me till the next Session of Congress make a thorough and systematic revisal— On a cursory glance at Humboldts New Spain I find at Vol. 2. p. 229. Chapter 8. Section 10. Intendancy of San Luis Potosi, notice of the claim of the United States to Texas under the Louisiana Treaty; and the very distinct opinion of the author against it.— I find also two important facts to be hereafter noted— First, in Joutel’s Narrative of La Sale’s last voyage—of his death by a musket ball fired by a man of his own company named Duhaut, on the 19th. of March 1687. page 201— Secondly in Tonti’s book published in 1697.—p. 329 speaking of his own wanderings in the Country of the Nanadiches,—he says, “Nous quittames leur pays le 29 du Mois de Mai (1690) et nous avançames jusqu à une journée des Palaquessons. Ce sut là que nous apprimès que la derniere Colonie etablie par M. de la Sale sur les bords de la Mer Mexique, n’aiant pu se maintenir dans une parfaite Union, s’etoit toute dispersée; que les uns s’etoient confondus avec les Sauvages, et que les autres avoient pris le parti de remonter vers les habitations Francoises.”— [“]C’est pour quoi n’aiant pas cru devoir les aller chercher ou ils n’etoient plus, je me resolus de revenir sur mes pas”— In the same book p. 192 is the account of La Sale’s first discovery on the 7th. of April 1683 of the Mouth of the Mississippi river, descending from Canada, the Lakes and the Illinois— Mr and Mrs Frye and Mrs W. S. Smith dined with us, and Doctor Frye was here this evening.— I answered a very strange Letter lately received from Thomas F. Marshall, who seems disposed to make a witness of me against Henry Clay.— "

                "text": "28. IV:15. Friday  Fahrenheit continuously at 90.  The extreme heat of the weather reduces my condition to a state little above mere vegetation— I have had for a succession of years repeated invitations to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum at Frankford 6. miles North of Philadelphia; and have repeatedly promised at some time to comply with this request— I had concluded to go to Philadelphia next Wednesday—to devote the Evening to the Frankford Lyceum—return then to Philadelphia, and pass the 4th. in quiet there— But as the time appraches difficulties are started— I am so much debilitated and prostrated in physical strength by the heat, that I feel an invincible repugnance to undertake a speech in public before strangers— So I postpone our departure for home till Monday the 8th. of next Month, and halt only for the Night at Philadelphia— This morning I had a visit from my old friends, Richards and Ha-lilio. Ambassadors from the Sandwich Islands; now on their return from their Mission to England and France. They succeeded in obtaining from the Governments of both those Nations professed acknowledgments of them as a Sovereign Independent Nation—but in the mean time—Lord George Paulett, commander of the British took possession of the Islands in the name of Queen Victoria— This measure effected on the 25th. of February 1843. was disavowed by the Queen, and on the 31st. of July 1843. King Kamehameha the third, was restored to the sovereignty of the Islands by treaty with commodore Richard Thomas Commander of the British line of Battleship Dublin. But I learn by a private Letter from our Commissioner to the Islands dated at Honolulu, 19 and 23. Feby 1844. that on the 5th. of that Month the English Corvette Hazard arrived there from St. Blas and Mazatlan having on board the English Consul-General Mr Miller, who shortly after concluded with the king a Treaty, by one Article of which English subjects are to enjoy in the Islands all the privileges of natives—by another not more than 5 per cent duties are to be levied upon Articles imported from England, without reciprocity; and by a third, the British Consul is authorised to appoint the jury for the trial of any British subject, charged with any crime— Mr Richards was conscious that these Articles were scarcely compatible with the pretensions of a Government to absolute Sovereignty and Independence; and admitted our right to claim for citizens of the United States the benefit of all these Articles, as much as if they had been concluded with us— These Commissioners had not yet seen the Secretary of State, or the President, who returned this day from New York with a wife of 22. Julia Gardiner, daughter of David Gardiner of Long Island, who was killed by the bursting of the gun in the Princeton last February. They were married by bishop Onderdonk, in the Church of the Ascension, the day before yesterday, at New-York. "

The summer heat and its enervating spell continues— I walked this morning to my old bathing station upon the strand of the Potomac river and bathed and swam for about 10 minutes, and then walked home— From the practice of personal ablution and the exercise of swimming I cannot totally abstain, for I believe they have promoted my health and prolonged my life many years. And yet the experience of late years has compelled me gradually to disuse them— But my great anxiety now, is having much to do, and to be doing nothing.— I called at the Globe Office, and saw Mr Kane the book-binder of that establishment— He has my file of Documents for the 3d. Session of the 27th. Congress; they are not complete, and I requested him before binding them to send to Mr French the sub-Clerk of the house, to have the missing papers supplied. I returned to the Globe office a remnant of the numbers of the Congressional Globe of 1842—found among my loose papers since I returned the rest— I called at the Patriotic Bank, and left my book there to be balanced. Then at the Office of the National Intelligencer, and saw Mr Gales— I took a paper of the 27th. containing my Card to take leave of all invitations to public meetings.— It contains also a remarkable speech of W. S. Archer in the Senate against the advice and consent to ratify the Treaty for the annexation of Texas to the United States. At the Office of the Clerk of the House, French was not there— I requested of the Clerk who was there a copy of the memorial of A. de Kalb Tarr, and 179 citizens of Pennsylvania, praying for an alteration of the naturalization Laws, so as to require 21 years of residence by foreigners before admitting them to all the privileges of native Americans— This was the first memorial presented to the house on the subject— I moved its reference to the judiciary Committee but it was laid on the table by yeas and nays. 15 days after it was at my motion taken up from the table and referred to the Committee on the judiciary— The clerk promised me a copy for Monday next with the names of the signers. I shall see whether the Editors of the National Intelligencer will publish it— I declared in the house that I should not hold myself bound to support the demand in the house; but at the next Session on the native American party will be heard in both houses, and the proceedings of house on this first memorial, will have a material influence upon the debate. Mr Frye came this afternoon and gave me the accounts of his agency for my private affairs in this City— They have remained unsettled several years till I am afraid to look at them— I have shrunk from the task too long. I walked this afternoon to the President’s grounds, and heard there the music of the Marine band— Met there Mr and Mrs Morris son and daughter of John C. Spencer, beau Laurence, B. O. Tayloe, Mr Pyne and General Daniel Parker who pointed to old Cooper at Galabrun’s door. "

                "text": "30. V. Sunday.  Cooler— Fahrenheit down to 84. At the second Presbyterian Church, Mr Knox preached from Matthew 23.33. “How can ye escape the damnation of hell?”— He read the whole chapter of tremendous denunciation of Woe, eight times repeated against the Scribes and Pharisees, for their hypocrisy.— This discourse was held almost immediately before the arrest, trial, sentence and execution of the Messiah— It is in this chapter also that occurs the pathetic, and affecting prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem— There is no mention of pharisees in any book of the old Testament— Nor in the apocryphal books— But they are found in the New Testament as a profession, of half Priests, half Lawyers, invested with authority, for Jesus says they sit in Moses seat and with his bitterest reproaches upon them, he enjoins upon his disciples implicit obedience to their authority— The believed the resurrection, the existence of Angels and Demons, and the retributions of a future state— They veiled their vices therefore with hypocrisy, and made great show of rigid and austere virtue— He charges them with prevarication, cruelty, extortion and excess, all under the disguise of hypocrisy— And this was the class of man, of whom he demanded how can ye escape the damnation of hell? Is it a suitable enquiry to make of Christians in communion with the church? It is inconceivable to me, how men of decent character can suffer themselves to be treated from week to week like the vilest malefactors— It seems to me as if the preacher considered himself as a chaplain to a penitentiary, discoursing to the convicts.— After dinner at St. John’s church Mr Pyne read the evening service for the 4th. Sunday after Trinity and preached the remainder of his Sermon, begun last Sunday from Matthew 7.20. “By their fruits ye shall know them.”— The divisional part which he had left for consideration this day, was the third and last— The extent to which the world does hold the deportment of the Christian man, by which he appeared to understand the Christian minister responsible to them— He said they were often censured for not wearing an unalterably cheerful appearance and he assigned various reasons why the Christian man should were an appearance of gravity— Sometimes he said they were censured for the opposite property of hilarity unbecoming the Christian profession, which he considered equally unreasonable. The discourse was upon the whole a dissertation upon the injustice of the judgments of the world, and upon the duty of maintaining a spirit of independence against them; indicating a consciousness of the necessity of self-vindication. I answered this evening a Letter received last January, from a young man named Thomas W. T. Curtis, enclosing, a mutilated copy of my Vision—in the hand-writing of Mary Frazier. "

Monday  Mr Pakenham the British Minister called on me this morning and I had a long and very free conversation with him, not upon his negotiations here, of which no mention was made either by him or me— He seemed anxious to know whether a special Session of Congress would be called as has been much rumoured but recently as if by authority denied— Immediately after the rejection by the Senate of the annexation Treaty Henderson who had come post-haste as Minister Plenipotentiary to sign it started post haste back it was said to prevent the abandonment of the project by the Texians, and to negotiate a popular movement there, still to cram down the annexation— I told Mr Pakenham, that I had seen with great pleasure in the Parliamentary papers of 1839 and 40. lent me by Mr Fox, the avowal by Lord Palmerston in a despatch to Lord Howard de Walden that to promote the abolition of Slavery throughout the world was a fixed and settled system of the British Government.— I had seen in the same papers the negotiations with all Europe and all America, especially with the Pope and the Bey of Tunis all tending to the same result— I told him of the visit of Andrews the Texian and of Lewis Tappan to me before they went to England last Summer— That Mr Andrews had communicated his designs to me, and I had expressed to him my doubts of his success. I had expressed the same doubt to Mr Tappan, and told him I thought the British Government would in this case sacrifice their principles to their policy— Mr Lewis Tappan without authority from me had apprized Lord Aberdeen of this opinion of mine, and Lord Aberdeen had protested against it but it had proved correct— The abolition of Slavery in Texas without war or bloodshed had been completely within the power of Great Britain, but her Government had failed to carry out their own principles.— They disclaim and concede too much. They parry carte and tierce to avoid the issue tendered them, and which they must meet— This was not the general character of English diplomacy. It was usually bold, open, explicit, stubborn— I could not perceive it in Lord Aberdeens disavowals nor in Mr Charles Elliots recent Letter to President Houston— Mr Pakenham took no offence at what I said, and spoke with much caution and reserve in return— He seems afraid of the English principles themselves, and fearful that the use of them would be to put edge tools in the hands of children— I called at Dyer’s auction room— At the Patriotic Bank, and at the Office of the Clerk of the House where I was furnished with a copy of the native American Memorial of A. De Kalb Tarr and 179 others with the names— I met Persico there, and he asked me to take him home to Fullers hotel—which I did— He afterwards brought me a bust of John Nelson, the present Attorney General, to look at his Visits from Mrs Carroll and Mrs Madison Cutts.

I sent this morning two blue chests N. 11. and 14. with the chest containing the documents of the 2d. and 3d. Sessions of the 27th. Congress, to Georgetown where they were ship’d in the Brig William L. Jones Samuel R. Davis, Master, for Boston— I made out with the help of my granddaughter Mary Louisa my account as Executor of the Will of Thomas B. Johnson, and took it to the judge of the orphan’s court. Nathl. P. Causin— He examined the vouchers and admitted them all, after at first objecting that a promissory Note for 150 dollars should have been sworn to by M. A. Giusta. He concluded to pass it without requiring the oath. I left my account and vouchers, upon which the Register Edward N. Noah is to make the Statement of the account in the form practised at the Office, and in which it is passed by the judge— I have kept the accounts at the Patriotic Bank, where I found this morning a balance in my favour on my Executor’s account of 626.63. which I drew in bills of the Bank— On re-examination of the account that I had delivered, an omission of four items with which I should have charged myself—two of them were on my bank book, but had escaped my attention— The other two were notes protested at the bank, and taken out and delivered to Mr Dyer for collection. I called yesterday and this day at Dyer’s auction room, but he was not there.— I visited also Mr Peter Force to enquire about the delivery of the 3d. Volume of the American Archives, but only ascertained where I must enquire further— Force had a bound copy of the 5th. volume of the American Archives; but they are not yet generally bound for delivery. And there is yet a 6th. Volume to complete the fourth series, extending only from the 19th. of April to 1774 to the 4th. of July 1776— He proposes then to take up the 3d and the 5th. series conjointly— I despatched my answer to Thomas W. T. Curtis of Rye New Hampshire and returned to him the mutilated copy, in Clara’s hand-writing of my vision— Did she give it away before her death? or leave it to her sister or her husband? why should I enquire? Miss Cutts was here this evening— There was a light thunder shower yesterday and a heavy shower without thunder this afternoon.— I took a short walk at evening twilight, but the weather is so languishing that I barely made out to finish a short note, for publication with my closing list of petitions for this Session— The note is on the memorial of A. de Kalb Tarr, and 179 native Americans, which on the 31st. of May the house laid on the table and on the 15th. of June took up and referred to the judiciary Committee.

Wednesday  Mr Lewis Johnson came to enquire if I had again spoken to the first comptroller of the Treasury concerning the remnant of claim of the heirs of William Otis— I told him I had been at the Comptroller’s Office to see him but he was not there— I proposed to go there again on Friday— He proposed that Mr Fendall should go with me, to which I assented, and he will request Mr Fendall to call on me at 10. Friday morning.— I settled accounts at Kinchy’s and Clagett’s. Saw R. W. Dyer who told me he had received the money on Milburn’s and Turner’s notes and would send it to me in the course of the day— I received at the Bank of Washington 90 dollars for the quarter’s interest on the Washington Corporation 6. per Cents.— Then at the Orphan’s Court, I added to my statement of account with the Estate of Thomas B. Johnson the 4 items which had been omitted, and took it to have it adjusted in conformity with the account as stated by the Register to which he then swore me.— At the Patriotic Book, I exchanged three of their 100 dollar Bills for an order upon the Bank of America in New-York. Then at the Office of the National Intelligencer I left with Mr Gales, my closing list of Petitions, presented by me to the House at the recent Session of Congress, with a Note upon the Memorial of A. de Kalb Tarr and 179 citizens of Pennsylvania, praying for an alteration of the naturalization Laws, so as to require 21 years residence for admission to the rights of suffrage; and a copy of the Memorial itself with the names of the signers and the endorsements of the Clerk shewing the first and second disposal of it by the house. Gales promised that the whole should be published in the Intelligencer on Saturday Morning, and I desired him to send me half a dozen copies of that day’s paper.— Gales said there was a new phase of the Texas question— Some new suspicion of British interference to abolish Slavery in Texas, prompted by Robert Walsh, now turned into a hack slave-driver, in one of his Letters published in the Intelligencer. There had been two Cabinet Meetings and it was the meerest chance that there had not been a call for an extra Session of Congress.— He said that Waddy Thompson was now here again.— He attended a whig meeting at Albany, a few days after the close of the Session of Congress; and there declared himself opposed to the annexation of Texas now and at any time— He is now at Fuller’s Hotel, and was hesitating whether to come out immediately with a publication in the Intelligencer, or to wait till his return to South Carolina— Gales told him there was no moment like the present moment and furnished him with several documents that he wanted; and he is now writing for publication— I walked after dinner half way to the race ground and back— My wife is confined to the chambers and my own condition is not much better— I began this evening an answer to J. Wingate about the statistical memorial, but shall not have time to finish it before I return to Quincy, and who knows what will occupy me there?— The blunders of the census and their consequences call for the bow and the shaft of Ulysses, and I have nothing but the telum im belle, sine ictu of Priam.

O’Clock P.M. this day at the delivery of an Oration by one of its members, and at an entertainment given by the faculty of the College, and the Society— One of my reasons for remaining in this city after the close of the Session of Congress till this day shall be past, was to escape from all the celebrations to which I was or might be invited; the noise and bustle and excitement and ranting of this day having become irksome to me. I intended nevertheless to attend this oration and entertainment at the Georgetown College, but my driver took an holiday for himself and disappointed me— I was however well pleased with my disappointment, passed the day very quietly at home till close upon Sunset when I strolled out for an hour, and on returning stop’d at Mrs Madison’s and took leave of her for the summer— Morning and evening visitors, as by the margin; chiefly military Officers, who had been in grand costume to pay their devoirs to the President— The wedding visit last Saturday and that of Independence day came so close together that the attendance this day was thin— Captain Tyler and his bride are the laughing stock of the city. It seems as if he was racing for a prize banner to the nuptials of the mock heroic— The Sublime and the Ridiculous.— He has assumed the war power as a prerogative; the veto power as a caprice; the appointing and dismissing power as a fund for bribery, and now under circumstances of revolting indecency, is performing with a young girl from New-York the old fable of January and May.— I wrote this day a Letter toBarnes and A. de Kalb Tarr in answer to that which they addressed to me with the memorial calling for alteration of the naturalization laws— It took all the leisure of the day and when written was too long. The native Americans are falling into the blunders of the abolition Societies. They have an excellent cause which they will ruin by mismanagement— The Native Americans, like the anti-masons will have a momentary and limited success; but the staff will break in their hands and lay them in the dust. My wife has been several days unwell, and is confined to the chambers— Rather unwell myself. "

Bibb of Kentucky was the day before yesterday was installed as Secretary. Our business was with the first Comptroller James W. M’Culloh; and to urge the allowance of the remnant of claim for interest on the accounts of William Otis— His objection was that Francis S. Key, the Counsel for the claim, now deceased had chosen to have it settled without advancing this demand, and that it was now too late to go behind that settlement— He offered however to refer it again to the present Attorney General John Nelson; but intimated that his opinions with regard to the allowance of claims were far less indulgent than those of his predecessor the late Hugh S. Legaré— I went to the Capitol to return to the Congress Library all the books that I had borrowed there, but found it closed; the days of keeping it open during the recess of Congress being Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday instead of Tuesday and Friday as I had supposed— I left the books with Mr French of the House Clerk’s Office who promised to have them returned to the Library to-morrow— I took a few further Articles of Stationery, and the third Volume of the American Archives to complete my set.— French promised to send me to Quincy the remaining sheets of the Journal as they shall be delivered from the printers, and the diplomatic correspondence with Spain from 1816 to 1819 not yet printed— I called at the orphans court, and enquired of the judge respecting the distribution of the balance remaining in my hands of Mr Thomas B. Johnson’s property undevised; being according to the statement of the Register and to which I was sworn by him 492 dollarscents— The judge said it must be distributed between the five surviving sisters in equal portions, with a sixth equal share to be divided between the two surviving children of the eldest sister the first Mrs Hellen.— There being only a grand child of Mrs Pope living, by the statute of distributions no part of the property comes to her— Mrs John Adams and her daughter Mary-Louisa dined and spent the day at Mr Frye’s— My wife is much indisposed and confined to the chambers— I dined alone— Revised my Letter to W. D. Barnes and A. De Kalb Tarr, and struck out of it a whole page of red pepper very palatable yesterday, but flat, stale and unprofitable to day. Examined Mr Frye’s account, and drew up a petition to the judge of the orphan’s Court, stating the balance of Mr T. B. Johnson’s undivided property in my hands, naming the heirs entitled to it, and requesting an order for the distribution of it among them. "

                "text": "6. IV:15. Saturday  Mr Lewis Johnson came to take leave before my departure. Mr Fendall had told him the result of our conference with the first comptroller. I determined to postpone leaving this city from Monday till Wednesday next; partly on account of my wife’s illness for which Dr. Thomas is in attendance, and partly to finish as far as possible the settlement of Mr T. B. Johnson’s estate as his executor— I went first to the orphan’s court with my petition for an order of distribution of 480 dollars of the balance in my hands among the heirs of Mr Johnson being 80 dollars for each of the five surviving sisters, and 40 dollars for each of the two children of the first Mrs Hellen, the eldest sister.— The Register told me I could obtain the order from the judge at his house 11th. between G and H. Streets. I went there, and the judge entered upon my petition, an order to the Register to make out an order of distribution accordingly.— I then took my petition with this direction of the judge upon it, back to the Register, who thereupon made out the order of distribution which he sent me in the course of the day.— At the Bank of Washington I received Bills for 53 dollars 55 cents upon the check of R. W. Dyer which he sent me yesterday— At the Office of the National Intelligencer, I took 6 copies of the paper of this day, containing my closing list of Petitions, presented by me at the recent Session of Congress to the house of Representatives, with the note upon the memorial of A. de Kalb Tarr and 179 citizens of Pennsylvania, praying for alteration of the naturalization Laws. I enclosed one of these papers in my Letter to W. D. Barnes, and A. de Kalb Tarr; and one to my Son, for the long Letter of Waddy Thompson junr. against the annexation of Texas, and the annexation Treaty.— I met Mr Thompson at the Intelligencer Office, and had a long conversation with him and Mr Gales, on the subject— Thompson is a South-Carolina planter, owner of 100 Slaves, and religiously believes that Slavery was made for the African race and the African race for Slavery.— He opposes the annexation of Texas on Southern grounds as a Southern man— So did Calhoun—so did M’Duffie. So did Hamilton, all now rabid annexationists— Thompson will be converted like them. He knocks down Walker, Wilkins and C. J. Ingersoll with their own Maul. But he smuggled through Congress the acknowledgment of Texas, prematurely— He is as cunning as four yankees, as sly as four quakers, and just now admires the People of Massachusetts too much.— I hope his Letter will be eminently useful at the present crisis, and devoutly pray that he, and Benton, and the Princeton gun, may be instruments for the deliverance of my Country.

                "text": "7. V. Sunday.  A new protestant Episcopal church has been built in our neighbourhood, called the Church of the Epiphany, under the charge of the Revd. John W. French, who was chaplain to the house of Representatives at the special Session of Congress in 1841. and since then has preached some time in Georgetown, and later here in Washington, till he has gathered a flock and become their pastor perhaps not in the most regular order of apostolican succession— They have not even waited for the consecration or dedication of the church, which is yet unfinished, but in which he performed publish worship for the first time, this day.— He read the morning prayer with the litany and short communion for the fifth Sunday after Trinity— He preached from Psalm 122.1. “I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord.”— It was an elaborate and regular dedication sermon, in which he enumerated all the reasons which a Christian has for being glad when he is summoned to go into the house of the Lord— The blessing of constant and faithful attendance upon public worship— This is a subject upon which it becomes a man to be distrustful of his own motives. The pleasure of attending upon the ordinances of religion may be an impulse of self righteousness, any thing but virtue. Attendance upon public worship for the purpose of homage to our own maker is the bare performance of duty—for the purpose of receiving instruction and reproof is just and reasonable; for the purpose of seeing and being seen of men, is vanity and hipocrisy, for mere curiosity, is idleness; and for the purpose of carping upon the performances of the preacher is an abusive exercise of faculties given for self improvement and gratitude to God— Mr French preached without notes. There is no pulpit, and he came from behind the desk with frequent exhibition of his person—his gesticulation was graceful; his elocution fluent, his delivery earnest and impressive— He gave notice that he would administer the communion the next Lord’s day, but did not add the usual exhortation of the episcopal prayer-book to partake of it. After dinner at Saint John’s church, Mr Pyne read the evening prayers for the same day and preached from Psalm 119.18. [“]Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things, out of thy law”— Mr Pyne is a very acceptable preacher— Mr Cutts and his daughter Mary spent part of the Evening with us—and Mr Charles B. King. "

                "text": "8. IV:30. Monday  One of the greatest dangers in this world to a man’s moral honesty is the possession of money belonging to others. The temptation to use it as his own, is perpetually recurring; and when thus used it becomes at once a debt and a privation of the means of paying it— In my ordinary concerns I have upon an average three calls for money every day— If I have money of others at hand, and none of my own, it is so convenient to borrow for the present payment that the future call to refund is overlook and debt, burdensome debt is unwarily contracted— On making up my first account of the Execution of Mr Thomas B. Johnson’s Will, I found a balance of 503 dollars 27 cents in my hands undevised— But the practice at the Orphan’s Court is that the Register makes up the account in his own way; and he accordingly made out my account, with a balance of 492:78. to which he put me upon oath— I gave him notice that the balance of my own statement was larger, and that I should credit the Estate for the difference in my second account— To disburden myself as far as possible of this balance I concluded to pay off the portions due to all the heirs now here, for which purpose I exchanged the order from the Patriotic Bank on the Bank of America at New-York, which I had taken for 300 dollars and took one for 100 dollars, and the other 200 dollars in bills of the late banks of this City— I drew also the remaining balance of 58.43. of the deposit for Mrs John Adams.— I then called on Mrs Adelaide Hellen at her house, paid her 80 dollars, and took her receipt. Then on Mr Frye at the paymaster general’s office—paid him 160 dollars for the portions of Mrs Frye and Mrs W. S. Smith for which they afterwards sent me their receipts— I had already those of my wife, of Johnson Hellen, and of Mrs John Adams.— There remains now only that of Mrs Boyd, which I cannot yet obtain— And I still owe 100 dollars to my wife and 140. to Mrs John Adams.— I returned to the Department of State The two Volumes of Instructions to Ministers of the United States in Europe, and two printed Volumes of English diplomatic collections which I had borrowed last Year. I enquired of Mr Calhoun if any answer had yet been received about the papers to be obtained from the Province of New-Brunswick— None— While I was with Mr Calhoun, he received a Note from the President requesting his immediate attendance at a Cabinet Meeting, about the horrible and bloody riots at Philadelphia— At the War Department I requested the re-entrance of the name of Robinson as an applicant for a Cadet warrant. Mrs Frye and Mrs Smith were here this Evening— Walk over the Tiber. "

I enter this day on the 78th. year of my age; and but for a blessed dispensation of almighty God, it would have been the last day both of my own life, and of that of my dear and ever beloved wife. We both escaped as if by miracle, and neither of us unhurt— I rose this morning at Barnum’s in Baltimore, before the Sun, and after journalizing the day for yesterday, sent for Mr. A. A. Phelps, and had a long conversation with him concerning Charles T. Torrey in prison here upon a charge of enticing away Slaves from a Citizen of Maryland; and demanded by the Governor of Virginia to be delivered upon a charge of the same crime in that State— I enquired, what was the punishment for that crime in the two States— Mr Phelps said imprisonment at the discretion of the court, not exceeding 20 years.— I asked the opinions of Mr Gallagher on Slavery. I enquired if other, and more employed to argue the whole case before the chief Justice as the Circuit judge and then before the Supreme Court of the United States— He said that Reverdy Johnson, and M’Mahon had been mentioned. I thought that sound opinions on the subject of Slavery, and an undaunted spirit to assert and maintain them were indispensable qualifications for any person selected for that argument, and I recommended that the counsel might be specially requested to study and refer freely to the case of the Negro Somerset in Howell’s State Trials to the case of the Antelope in Wheaton, and to my Review of it in the argument for the Amistad captives— To Mr Baldwin’s argument in that same case; and to Lord Stowell’s decision in the case of the Slave Grace, and I said that having a great personal regard for Mr Torrey I should happy if I could furnish his counsel with any information which might be useful for his defence.— We left Baltimore at 9. A.M in the train of Cars for Philadelphia, which city we reached about 4 in the afternoon, and found yet in amphibious state between mob and martial Law— We concluded to proceed immediately to New-York. At 5 in the afternoon we left Walnut street wharf in the Steamer New Philadelphia and came to Bristol 20. Miles—there landed, and proceeded in the train of Cars through Trenton, New Brunswick, Elizabethtown and Newark to Jersey City— The Sunset between Trenton was glorious, equal to anything I ever beheld— As I witnessed the departing luminary, and the peace and quiet and felicity of all around me, I thought of Washington and Trenton, and the 25th. of December 1776 and a feeling of inexpressible joy, filled my Soul— Between 10 and 11. we alighted from the cars on an unrailed floor, raised about 4 feet above the ground. walking on this floor, dark as midnight, I stept unawares off the floor, and pitched over, and drew my wife, whose arm was linked in mine over after me. Blessed be God neither neck nor limb of either of us was broken— We were enabled after an hour of delay to cross the ferry to New-York, and reached the Aston house before midnight. "

Friday  The sensation which I suffered last night by the shock of my own fall, instantly succeeded by that of my wife was such as I never in my life experienced before, and which I have no words to describe; while falling I had the distinct idea that I was killed— A shriek from my wife, and the consciousness that she too was killed had in it a thrill of horror of which I knew not that the human frame was susceptible. My fall was so disposed that my left hip first met the earth tip’d me over upon the right side and laid me sprawling, but neither my head nor my body struck the earth— I instantly rose, feeling pain only on the hip and that not severe—but the terror for my wife, no pang of death could surpass. She had fallen forwards. Her cloathing had protected her from any shock to the body, but her left wrist was sprained and the recoil from the ground struck her breast; broke the glass of the breastpin, and slightly bruised a spot on the upper side of her chin below the lip. She had fainted and was senseless. Several men came to our assistance— They took her up and carried her into one the house sheds of the railroad company where were benches to sit upon. A physician was sent for, but as she soon came to and appeared not to be much hurt that order was countermanded— The other passengers had crossed the river in the Steam-ferry boat, and that boat in about half an hour returned. My wife had then so far recovered that she was able to be led to the boat; we crossed the river, and a hack took us to the Astor house. They gave us two bed-rooms on the first floor, and before midnight we were lodged for the Night, still unknowing how much we were injured but grateful that our lives and limbs had been spared— After a restless and agitated Night my wife felt the pain of the blow on the breast more than last Night— The skin was not broken on my hip but the bone was painful and sore, and a spot on my hip and thigh as large as a common dinner table plate is crimson with extravasated blood. It was bathed with vinegar, but as it did not pain me much I walked out—called upon Mr Lewis Tappan, and had some conversation with him respecting the case of Mr Torrey. At the Bank of America, I received in its bills 262.50 on the orders from the Patriotic Bank at Washington— At the door of the Bank I met Mr Sedgwick with a passing salutation— On returning to the Astor house, the inflammation upon my hip was so exasperated as to produce spasms in the calf of my leg— I was obliged to lie down, and to have the part rubbed with cold vinegar— After an hour of rest I took a Cab and went to N. 122 Bleecker Street where I found Mr Edward S. Marchant Portrait Painter. He had charged me 200 dollars for copies of two small profiles of President Washington and my father— I objected to this price and offered him 100 dollars about double their worth for the two—which with some reluctance he accepted, and gave me a receipt in full— I returned to the Astor house. My wife—Mary Louisa and the Servants without waiting to dine came on board the Steamer Rhode-Island— I came on board after dinner, and at 5 we departed for Stonington. "

Neither my wife nor myself can yet ascertain the extent to which we have been personally injured by that terrific fall of Thursday Night, on alighting from the Cars at Jersey City. The shock upon her nerves jar’d her whole frame, and suspended all consciousness and animation for nearly ten minutes— The stroke upon the breast broke the glass of the breast pin, and the stricture on the breast is yet sore and feverish. She kept her bed all day yesterday; last Night and this day till evening. She sent for Dr Woodward who came, and applied leeches to her breast; from which she obtained some relief. The suffusion of blood on and around my left hip looks frightful—the pain is slight and passing away, but the cords of the leg are growing stiffer, and make me limp. I rode to and from Meeting, both parts of this day. Mr Lunt preached in the forenoon from 1. Corinthians 12.21. “And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.” This is in substance the old Roman Fable of Menenius Agrippa, which I suppose Paul borrowed from his familiar acquaintance with Roman history. Mr Lunt noticed as one of the striking characteristics of the Scriptures, that they deliver instruction, in the form of parables and fables— He noticed especially those of Jotham to the men of Shechem, and those of Nathan to David— They are undoubtedly among the most impressive parts of the Bible; narrative enlists the imagination—narrative takes hold of the sympathies, and strikes its roots into the Memory— It exercise all those faculties too in the process of composition, and is by all odds the most difficult part of writing— Mr Lunts discourse was an argument upon the mutual dependence of all the members of a community upon one another, and he closed with an illustration of his own, introducing a dialogue of self-glorification and disparagement, between the roots and leaves and blossoms of trees, which will leave the whole sermon fresh on my memory, and keep in preservation the didactic parts. Mr Lunt’s afternoon discourse was from Philippians 4.8. [“]Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think of these things.” A general exhortation to truth, justice, honesty, a modification of honesty, purity, another, loveliness, and good report—virtue and praise— Mr Lunt considered these several specifications in succession— He has improved much in his mode of delivery, using much more action, and animating his discourse even to vehemence. None of our Ladies attended public worship; and Mrs Charles Adams was confined at home this afternoon. Charles passed the evening here. My mind was not sufficiently settled to enable me to devote all the day to the most suitable occupations— "

The fall at Jersey city, is yet severely felt, both by my wife and by myself; and still we know not how long and how far it will continue to be felt.— She is better this day; but still confined to her chamber. I am yet lame, and crippled, for walking. Patience, Resignation and blessing for the escape of us both from heavier calamity is the dictate of duty. In other respects, I luxuriate with delight in the tranquility and indolent repose of home— But indolence is waste and loss of time— This fable of Menenius Agrippa, stole upwards of hour of my time, in hunting for it, first in Livy, where, by the Index to the Bipont Edition Vol 13. I found it Book 2.32. and then in Shakespear’s Coriolanus, where it is charmingly dramatised in the first Scene— Mr Lunt paid me a visit this afternoon; and brought back the first Volume of Warton’s History of English Poetry; which belongs to the Adams town Library. Mr. Lunt had borrowed the 3. Volumes last autumn with the intention of preparing a course of Lectures on English Literature— Mr Lunt retains the 2d. and 3d. volumes of Warton, but has not accomplished his purpose of preparing a course of Lectures on English Literature. Well executed it would be a work of great usefulness; but it would be too large—too complicated— Warton’s history refers only to a very small fragment of the subject. It is the History of English Poetry from the close of the 11th. to the commencement of the eighteenth century, from 1100 to 1700. It comes not even down to the school of Queen Ann’s age— It is preceded by two Dissertations— One upon the origin of romantic fiction in Europe; and the other on the introduction of learning into Europe— Mr Lunt remarked that Warton’s subject does not embrace Shakespear, and although he does not wholly overlook the drama, he treats it very superficially— I observed that it would be difficult to give much interest to English Literature before the age of Elizabeth, but that a philosophical disquisition upon the genius and characters of the cotemporaries Shakespear, Spenser and Bacon would be rich in results— I spoke also of my published remarks on Shakespears Juliet, Lear, Desdemona, and Hamlet: and lent him a volume of miscellanies containing my replication upon the character of Desdemona— My Son came this afternoon, with four Deeds from the Trustees of Ward Nicholas Boylston’s Estate of lots of land in Charlestown—one to Andrew Hall, two to J. W. Whitten and one to Edward Adams—to be executed— I went with him this Evening to Mr Thomas Greenleaf’s to execute and acknowledge them before him as a Justice of Peace; but he said that although his commission had been renewed since it had expired; he had not taken the Oaths under the new Commission, and was therefore not qualified to take the acknowledgment of Deeds: so that we were obliged to defer the Execution to some other time— Mr Greenleaf was taking his new made hay prematurely put into the barn, out of it again, under symptoms of spontaneous combustion.

Soon after I rose this morning it began to sprinkle, so lightly that for nearly an hour I thought it a mere transient shower; but it continued and increased to a moderate steady rain till between 2 and 3 afternoon when it held up without clearing off— I was confined to the house by the weather and by my lameness. My wife was very sick, last night and all this day— Charles went to Boston, and returned home to dine. He and his wife passed a short evening here— My time is never tedious when I have my books around me; but there are so many and upon subjects so different, like baits upon a bundle of fish hooks, that I make after all, no profitable use of my time. After bringing up the arrears of this diary I commenced writing an address to my Constituents to give them an account of my conduct in the discharge of their trust— But precisely because this was the first and most burdensome task which I had imposed upon myself for the first moments of leisure at home, I found it insupportably irksome, and barely commenced and abandoned it— Menenius Agrippa and his fable occurred to me again and looked for and found it in Wrangham’s Langhornes Plutarch, and there I was referred to Dionysius Halicarnassensis for the most detailed account of the whole story. This I am yet to examine— I looked into the first volume of Warton’s history of English Poetry; found myself wading into deep waters, and for fear of losing my foothold immediately withdrew.— The charm of Lord Bacon was irresisible— I took up the first volume of his works in 5. quarto volumes—London 1765. and began upon his Life by David Mallet— I mean to pursue this steadily: a few pages every day. So strange a person—the wisest—greatest—meanest of mankind— Is there not instruction in every incident of such a man’s life— I see his relations with his father, Sir Nicholas Bacon Lord keeper—with Elizabeth and James—with the Cecils father and son, with Essex, and Coke, on the winding Staircase of human affairs. A short portion of this was a dose for meditation— After dinner in rummaging over the chests of old pamphlets which I would assort in some order, I pounced upon a collection of Documents numbered 155. dated Department of State April 15. 1818. and marked as referred to in the Report of the Secretary of State of the 14th March, accompanying the message to the House of Representatives of that date— This pamphlet contains the whole correspondence of the Negotiation of Charles Pinckney and James Monroe with the Spanish Government at Aranjuez from January to May 1805. concerning the claims of the United States founded on the Louisiana Treaty— P. 15 of this pamphlet marks the first assertion of our claim to the perdido, and the Bravo—page 20. proposes an article for adjustment of the boundary—p. 88. Don Pedro Cevallos 13. April 1805 Pinckney and Monroe answer 20. April 1805. p. 95. 98. 99. 100. Proposal of the Colorado—p. 105. by Pinckney and Monroe. "

Still crippled— But I walked with my Son, to Mr Lemuel Bracket’s and there we executed and acknowledged the four Deeds of the Trustees of Ward Nicholas Boylston’s Estate, of certain lots of land in Charlestown— I deposited in the Quincy Stone Bank, the order of the Bank of the Metropolis at Washington upon the Merchant’s Bank at Boston— We went into the adjoining burying yard, where the family tomb has now my name now carved on a granite stone in advance over its iron doors.— There are already the remains of ten relatives of the family deposited there without any inscription—but on the granite side wall, there are spaces for two, marble tablets on which their names and years may be inscribed. I visited the monuments erected by my father over the graves of his father and grandfather his mother and grandfathers third and last wife. Of the first and second there is no memorial left— They are doubtless there. An unclaimed Tomb is there believed to be that of my great grandfather whose name I bear, is there, but no trace of him or his wife— The monument of the Minister has been repaired, and some of the inscriptions first made upon it. Norton Quincy only son of my great grand father, whose funeral from my father’s, now my own house I attended in September 1801. was buried in this tomb, but his name was not until the recent repair incribed on it— Anna Fiske, daughter of Thomas Shepard, wife first of Daniel Quincy, and secondly of Moses Fiske, died 24. July 1708 and was buried in this tomb, but her name is not inscribed upon it— Which appears by extracts from Fairfield’s journal, published in the Appendix to Mr Lunt’s two century discourses. She was the mother of my great-grandfather— During the remainder of the day I was idling. Resumed the reading of David Mallet’s life of Lord Bacon; which as it proceeds excites more and more of curiosity— The degree of his obsequiousness and servility to Elizabeth and her favourite Essex, and his subsequent treachery and cruelty to Essex— Then the baseness of his submission to James and to Buckingham— His venality and corruption as Chancellor and his ignominious abandonment of self-defence upon his trial—with his transcendent Genius, his overruling passion for the liberal arts and the advancement of Science, and his indefatigable application to studious labour there is a combination of qualities equally astonishing and painful. Unbounded admiration and heart sickening contempt; how can they be entertained at once for one and the same person? We had evening visits from the Revd. Mr Waterston and his wife, and also from Mr Beale and his two daughters Ann and Caroline— Mr and Mrs Lunt, were likewise here this afternoon, but I did not see them— My business was wholly neglected— I looked into Banier for Minerva and Pallas.

                "text": "18. IV.15 Thursday.  My wife was so far recovered as to be able to leave her chamber, and my lameness is gradually and slowly subsiding— I visited my garden, and nursery and seminary, but the winter’s frost, and Summer’s drought have killed so many of my trees, that I lose my interest in the cultivation of them— If it be possible to pursue with consistency any cultivation of plants, and be absent from them, from six to eight months of every year, I have not been able to discover the secret.— The result of fifteen years of observation and study of the nature and growth of trees, has not furnished me with any knowledge which I could turn to improvement in the art of raising or preserving them.— My Son went to Boston this morning, and after an early dinner, his wife with their daughter Louisa Catherine, their Son Charles Francis and Mary-Louisa, departed for an excursion of ten days, to Stockbridge and to Lebanon Springs. Mrs John Adams went with them as far as Boston, and returned with Louisa C. Smith who is to pass the Summer with us. Elizabeth C. Adams also came and took tea with us— She returned last evening from a visit to her relations at Portland— I finished reading the life of Francis Bacon, Baron Verulam and Viscount St. Albans, by David Mallet, prefixed to the Edition of his works in 5 volumes Quarto.— And I began the perusal of his works.— This man was a prodigy and a paradox— He should be studied as a Chronometer or a steam-engine should be studied— As a piece of moral and intellectual mechanism. Why did I not so study him fifty years ago? and of what use will it be for me to study him now? Indulgence of curiosity— A longing thirst for knowledge— A refuge from the sickening realities of life, and desponding anticipations of the future, may perhaps carry me through this undertaking. The general reflection upon the life of Bacon is the melancholy aspect of great vicissitudes of Fortune— His transcendent talents, rapacious ambition, and disgusting sycophancy combined to raise him to the pinnacle of opulence, of honours and of power. The causes of his downfall were his connivance with briberies practiced by his servants, and with whom he shared the plunder— But James the first himself, and his minion Buckingham were deeply implicated in the charges upon which he was convicted, and it was more of their sins than of his own that he bore the penalty— James remitted successively all the parts of the sentence against him, and although he had been declared incapable of holding any office of trust whatever, he was yet summoned to the first Parliament of Charles the first in 1625— It does not appear that he attended— He died at the Earl of Arundel’s house in Highgate on the 9th. of April 1626. at the age of 64.— He was married after the age of 40, but never had a child and his wife survived him 20 years— After the remission of his fine he was severel pinched with penury and his supplicatory Letter to the king for relief is agonizing.

                "text": "19. IV. Friday.  Two young men, one named Salisbury from New-York, and the other Nelson from Boston, came out for mere curiosity to see the house— They were going away without enquiring for me, but I went out and spoke to them Salisbury said he had come from New-York, to see Boston on Bunker’s hill, and this house. I had also friendly visits from Mr John Whitney and Mr Josiah Brigham— I walked before dinner to the Post Office to despatch 3 letters and for exercise— But my thigh bone is yet sore, and the sinews are strained by walking— The extravasation of blood has spread downwards to the calf of the leg, and laterally to the left side of the loins, looking dark and threatening— The confinement to the house is tedious; I endeavour to cheer it by reading and travelled this day through the two Books of Francis Bacon, of the Proficience and advancement of Learning—human and divine— The work is dedicated to king James the first, and its introduction inspires a mingled sentiment of admiration of the boldness and grandeur of the design, which it announces, and of heart ache at the depth of degradation to which it sinks in servile adulation with which it besmears the king— It is presented as in the Nature and analogy of a free will offering from a worshiper to his Deity, alluding first to the daily sacrifices, and the occasional oblations of the Levitical Law—to which he likens the faithful performance of the duties of his official employments, and then proposing a voluntary superaddition of tribute appropriate to the transcendent learning of the king the wisest the greatest the most perfect monarch that ever sat upon a throne— And this was James the first! And this unparalleled royal learning should not only prove the glory of the then present age, but should be transmitted down to after ages as an imperishable monument for the benefit and admiration of Mankind— And this work was not the consummation of that mighty purport itself—but a mere outline of a plan to turn the royal cogitations to its atchievement— The stupendous magnitude of this undertaking; the courtly cunning ingenuity and meanness of suggesting it to the king as if it was an enterprize of his own, the lofty consciousness of its sublimity, and the sly implied disclaimer of it, as any thing more on the part of the author than a mere speculative hin to be moulded into form and substance are all deserving of profound meditation—of more than I can give.— He proceeds then to enumerate and to refute the objections against learning.— Of Divines— Of Politicians— As arising from the Fortunes, Manners, or Studies of Learned men— He discusses the Diseases of Learning, the peccant humours, which have not only given impediment to the proficience of Learning but have given also occasion to the traducement thereof— And he closes the book with a copious and cheering exhibition of the dignity of Learning—a theme upon which I follow him with delight.— The style is a continuous, and perpetual citation of classical and scriptural quotations. I rode this afternoon, with the Ladies, and little Arthur, as a substitute for exercise. "

                "text": "20. IV. Saturday.  Rain again, all the former part of this day, which together with my sore limb confined me to the house. Mr. Cole is the Editor of a weekly journal, called the Boston Cultivator—and came to invite my subscription to the paper, of which he left one of last Saturday as a sample— I declined for the present alledging the multitude of Newspapers which I daily receive, as more than I know what to do with. We had some conversation about farming, of which he agreed with me, that a man absent eighth months of the year from his farm could know very little— In the Boston Newspapers of this morning, I noticed that the Brig William L. Jones, Captain Davis, arrived yesterday from Georgetown, and I sent Benjamin with a waggon to Boston, and he brought out the three chests of books and papers, which he had ship’d on the 2d. of this month— I made some progress in reading Bacon, on the advancement of Learning. Finished the first and began the second book— In the dedication to king James, gross as his adulation is, it is not random praise— He extols him for four specific virtues—a virtuous disposition, a virtuous ambition—a virtuous observation of the Laws of marriage, and a virtuous and most Christian desire of Peace— These were real virtues of James’s character, and they are genuine king-becoming graces.— and it is piteous to reflect that with all these virtues and with all that learning for which he was not less famed, his character as a king and as a man is universally despised— He was weak—  For the fulsomeness of the flattery, I was seeking some excuse and it occurred to me that in monarchical Governments, this beplastering of the mighty man is conventional and formal; like your humble servant at the close of a Letter, or the greetings of acquaintances, and mere strangers, professing to be very obsequious to each other—meaning of course nothing of what is said— In the argument for the advancement of Science, I thought the objections, with which he began against it, were so frivolous, and trivial that they scarcely deserved the trouble of answering them. There is however something more forcible in the catalogue of the diseases of learning.— Hume speaks contemptuously of the style of Bacon— Its most remarkable character to my mind is the copious and original turn of his thoughts, with the incessant quotations from the bibles and from the Greek and Latin Classics.— I was not entirely satisfied with the life of Bacon by Mallet; and took up that of the Biographia Britannica, which is somewhat longer.— But the mode of writing with a load of Commentary always interrupting the narrative is intolerably tedious and incompatible with that unity which should be the first Law of written composition.

My wife was very sick all night, and I rose at 3. to light a lamp— She was confined this day till the Evening to her bed— I thought my wound was healed, till on walking to Meeting, I found it far otherwise— Mr Lunt preached from Romans 12.21. “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.” This text naturally introduced some disquisition upon the nature of good and evil, and the old perplexing enquiry why a Supreme Almighty creator, wise and good permits the existence of evil— A question which can never be solved— The Book of Genesis in its account of the Creation says, that in the process of the six days work, God surveyed it in successive parcels, and saw that it was good.— But good for what? good for whom? Good and evil are relative terms, but their relation is not to action but to sufferance— Creation is an act of power— Neither good nor evil to the Creator. Neither good nor evil to the created inanimate—good and evil have reference only to sensation— Sensation is individual, and what is good to one may be evil to another— Life, is enjoyment, and therefore is good; but unless we were commanded to love God, I see no reason by the Law of Nature why it should be required. But the meaning of St. Paul in this passage is to advise the forgiveness of injuries— It is the concluding verse of the 12th. Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, the summary of the whole doctrine of Christianity for this world— If there existed of the whole body of the holy scriptures nothing but this 12th. Chapter to the Romans, it would form the text of the most perfect religion that was ever devised upon Earth— Mr Lunt gave notice that immediately after the service of the afternoon, there would be an meeting of the members of the Church for the election of a Deacon, in the place of the late Deacon Samuel Savil. This was the first indication that I received of the death of Deacon Savil; of that of Deacon William Spear I had received advice some months since— I rode home, and to and from meeting this afternoon. Mr Degrand came out from Boston, and dined and spent the day with us. Mr Lunt’s text for his afternoon Sermon was from John 18.38. “Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?” He observed that perhaps Pilate put this question in a jeering Spirit; but he would suppose that of those who now heard him discourse some would with deep anxiety and sincere piety put to themselves often the same question, what is truth? And the conclusion to which after varied arguments he urged them to come was that Truth consisted in the firm conviction of the existence and omnipotence of God, of the immortality of our own Souls, and our responsibility beyond the grave— He closed with a very pathetic appeal to the hearts of his hearers upon this subject— The meeting of the members of the church for the choice of a deacon was held immediately after the service— The election was by ballot. The number of votes 28. of which 26 were for George Baxter. He was present and upon a call from Mr Lunt enquiring if he accepted the appointment; answered yes— Mrs T. B. Adams, Mrs John Angier, Elizabeth C. Adams and Elizabeth Harrod were here after meeting. "

                "text": "22. IV. Monday.  A day wholly uninterrupted by visitors; and much though not entirely confined to the house— The contusion upon my thigh bone is yet sore, and the flesh over it swollen; and it is angered by the exercise of walking— The extravasation of blood has discoloured the whole length of the thigh, and descended by the knee pit quite to the calf of the leg, creeping round at the same time upon the groin— All round the injured spot the surface of the skin is recovering its natural colour. But directly over the spot there is swelling, induration, heat, and slight pain to the touch. I have had some apprehension of internal suppuration; and Dr Woodward who examined the part on Sunday advised the application of leeches. Without examination, he repeated the advice this morning, but a diminution of the menacing symptoms, encouraging a hope of recovery by the vis medicatrix Naturae, I postponed receiving the visit of the leeches till tomorrow. I rode after dinner with Mrs John Adams, and Charles’s youngest boy Arthur round through Milton; and occupied the rest of the day, with the second book of Bacon’s advancement of learning, and with the life of Bacon, in the Biographia Britannica— The second book on the advancement of learning opens with a brief stimulant of flattery to king James, reminding him of the peculiar inducement to him to illustrate his name and reign by the advancement of knowledge for the benefit of after ages, inasmuch as he has progeny of his own, and a prospect of more, while his immediate predecessor Elizabeth, was a sojourner in the world, in respect of her unmarried life— He then proceeds to consider what had been undertaken and performed by kings and others for the increase and advancement of learning. Genius invents—talent combines, skill marshals, and judgment separates ideas— In embracing the whole compass of human knowledge, Bacon begins by dividing it into parts, and presents in a table the General Distribution of human knowledge— “The parts of human learning have reference to the three parts of Man’s Understanding which is the seat of learning; History to his Memory, Poesy to his Imagination, and Philosophy to his Reason—[”] The subdivisions of this classification are desperately numerous and complicated and after enumerating them he specifies upon each separate part of the system those which had, and those which had not before that time been sufficiently explored by human labour. It is not a little extraordinary that with such a range of intellectual power, he should have rejected the Copernican system of Astronomy, though he acknowledges that it accounts for all the apparent movements of the Heavenly orbs.— My progress in the reading of the life is slow, and painfully laborious by remarking the gigantic intellect and the moral obliquity combined in the character of this man.— The union of Power and of Virtue is so delightful in contemplation, that I shrink from the demonstration how far it was from being realized in the person of this great bad man— The present age is prolific of the depravity if not of the greatness.

He came to consult with me respecting the disposal of a part of the Estate of the late Ward Nicholas Boylston— I had forgotten to endorse the order from the Bank of the Metropolis at Washington upon the Merchants Bank at Boston for 80 dollarscents received as unclaimed dividends at the Treasury and which I sent by my Son last week to Mr Curtis— I now endorsed it payable to him— He wishes now to sell the Estate in School Street and has an offer for it of 30000 dollars from MrSargent. But Mr Bowditch the Lawyer is of opinion that the clause in the will directing that the old hereditary Estates should be reserved by the Executors as the last to be sold, prohibits the sale of the School Street Estate—while the Milk Street land purchased by Mr Boylston himself remains unsold— Mr Curtis wished me to examine that provision in the Will, and then go to Boston and advise with Mr Bowditch concerning it; which I promised and if sufficiently recovered from my lameness, to go in to Boston and meet him at my Son’s Office between 9 and 10. O’Clock next Thursday morning. I rode out this afternoon with Louisa C. Smith, Mrs John Adams, and Charles’s youngest boy, Arthur, this day three years old— Miss Smith alighted at Mr John Greenleaf’s and there we met Mr Thomas Loring of Hingham— We rode round by Dr Storrs’s meeting house at Braintree, and on our return stop’d at Mr Greenleaf’s— He and his wife, my cousin Lucy are barely alive— He is 80 years old, blind deaf paralytic; and crippled by a dislocated shoulder by a fall down stairs two or three years ago. She is three years younger than me, and for the last seven years has been half a dozen times supposed to be dying, yet they live— Mr and Mrs Loring and Miss Beach were still there. Mrs Lucy Dawes, and Mrs. Mary Dawes, with her husband George Dawes live with them— I asked Mrs. Greenleaf if she knew any thing of the French Sermon about which I received a Letter from the Revd. Mr Miles of Lowell, but she did not— I proceed in my reading of the second Book of Bacon on the advancement of Learning, and of his life in the Biographia Britannica— The multiplicity of his subdivisions of the Sciences has already crowded my Memory into confusion— I should need a close study of a week to embrace them all, with discrimination— He advises the study of the Mathematics for a bird-witted child—that is who has not the faculty of attention— I feel dismally the want of this faculty, and believe that I ought to enter upon a course of Mathematics. The Life in the Biographia is more detailed and circumstantial than that of Mallet, and gives the succession of his works of his honours and of his disgrace. His Life embraces no inconsiderable part of the Reigns of Elizabeth, and of James the first— I drag along heavily one page a day, in writing upon the special subject which I had determined to discuss during the present recess of Congress. Mr Loring wishes me to go to Hingham, on the 1st. of August. "

August 1842. in which it is stated that the Slaves of this Union were then represented in the National House of Representatives by 25 members, and enquired whether this was the fact now. I told him that the statement made upon the apportionment, by the census of 1830. when the house of Representatives consisted of 242 members. But that the present apportionment is fixed by the census of 1840— The house consisting of 223 members— The standard of apportionment 70680.— The numbers of Slaves 2,487,213— The standard gives one representative for 117800 Slaves, or 21 members and a decimal fraction of 113. for the whole number— But as an element of power, the whole delegations from the Slave holding States, and each member represents the whole Slave-holding interest, and the whole mass of Slave owners— The number of their members therefore is not 21 but 88. knit together by one interest and that interest the ascendancy of Slavery. Mr Spear said this was a view of the subject new to him, and I referred him to my report at the recent Session of Congress, on the Massachusetts Resolutions for a further exposition of it— I gave him a copy of the printed Document of the proceedings of the Senate on the Texian Annexation Treaty— This afternoon I received a visit from Mr William Lawrence with his youngest daughter, and an inmate of his family, Miss Hale, and with them came Miss Harriet Welsh; who remained to pass some time with us— I rode with Louisa C. Smith, Miss Welsh, and Mary to Dorchester over Milton Bridge, recrossing the Neponset above, and returning by the new village of the granite quarries, and the Roman Catholic Church surmounted by its Cross— My double reading of Bacon, on the advancement of learning, and of his life, suffers interruption, by numberless casual and trivial avocations, of which when the day is gone I can give no account— I see frequent reference to Dr Rawley’s life of Lord Bacon, but the name of Rawley is not in the Catalogue of Harvard University Library. Dr Tenison, Dr Shaw, Stephens and Arthur Wilson, in a History of Great-Britain are also quoted as authorities for sundry statements of facts— Only the last of these works is in the college library.— My own work of the Season labours along more than any thing else. In the National Intelligencer of the 19th. there is the translation of a Letter from General Santa Anna the Mexican President about the propositions sent by the special messenger G. L. Thompson to be remembered— Matter for discourse on this subject multiplies under my hand and becomes daily more difficult to discuss. "

I had promised Mr Nathaniel Curtis, to go into Boston this morning, to consult with him and Mr Bowditch about the sale of the Boylston Estate in School Street, and I have examined Mr Ward Nicholas Boylston’s Will to ascertain the extent of the limitation of the powers of the Executors to dispose of the real Estate— I find the words of the will are—the Estates which belonged to my Ancestors shall be the last sold. Now the Estate in School Street belonged to Thomas Boylston the third of the name in lineal descent including the first emigrant from England in 1636— He was not an ancestor of Ward Nicholas, but his uncle—brother to his mother Mary Hallowell, and Son of Thomas Boylston and Sarah Morecock.— This Thomas was the 4th. Son of the first emigrant Thomas. I find these particulars in a genealogical table compiled by Coll. A. S. Brooks 28 Septr. 1827. and copied by me 13. Septr. 1839. A question remains whether the Estate in School Street was purchased by the 3d. Thomas Boylston, or descended to him from his father. In the latter case, it comes within the limitation of the authority to sell— This question can be settled only by the title deeds.— I wished also to go in to Boston to attend the monthly meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society But about Sunrise it began to sprinkle and I waited till near 9. O’Clock hoping that it would hold up—instead of which it came to a steady rain— I countermanded the order for the carriage, and passed the day without going beyond the yard— My reading was so desultory, and my attention so distracted that I retain nothing that I read— I had well nigh forgotten my Letters to Edward Everett and T. Aspinwall for Mr G. W. Burnet— I finally enclosed them in a short Letter to him addressed them as he had directed to New-York.— I received this morning a New-York Daily Tribune of last Monday, containing a translation through the New Orleans Bulletin, from the Diario del Gobierno of Mexico, of a Correspondence between Ben E. Green, son of Duff Green chargé d’Affaires of the United States in Mexico, and Jose Maria de Bocanegra, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs: from the 25th. to the 31st of last May, whereby the Mexican Government was notified of the Treaty for the annexation of Texas which President Tyler had negotiated and sent to the Senate on theof April— I have also received two Sermons, one preached at the consecration of Bishop Eastburn, by Bishop De Lancey 29. December 1842 at Boston, and called the faithful Bishop; and the other by Edwards A. Park Professor at the Andover theological seminary, delivered on the 28th of May last at Boston, on the duties of the New-England Clergy— These Sermons, are the bane and antidote to each other. The New-York Evangelist of 11. July contains a narrative of a new expulsion of the Jesuits from Persia— This various and desultory reading absorbs my attention so that when I turn to the second Book of Bacon on the advancement of learning, my Memory becomes a cullender, and the stream of thought runs through as fast as I pour it in— Mary read this evening two Chapters of Coningsby— I suffered last Night with the rhumatism.

                "text": "26. IV:15 Friday.  The confinement to which I still subject myself owing to the disability of my left thigh, affects my spirits and health, that seems to change my nature. The privation of that exercise which for so many years I have made a necessary of life, is sinking me into a state of Apathy and stagnation of the blood. I have every evening on going to bed an application of Opodeldoc, and my thigh is slowly and gradually recovering its colour.— This morning I began to work with the hoe, upon my seedling trees in the seminary—very few of which remain alive— Josiah Adams came to speak of a pew in the Meeting house which for some years pass he has rented of me— The year expires in October, and he wishes to continue the lease for another year I promised him an answer next week, to consult in the mean time my Son, whose return home to-morrow we expect.— We had morning visits from Rufus Dawes and his wife, judge Cranch’s daughter Elizabeth—Mrs Mary Dawes, and a Miss Fisher— Lewis Bass Collector of the Parish tax, brought me my bill for the present year 171 dollars 5 Cents—which I took ad referendum. A man named Brazee came from Brattleborough in the State of Vermont— Left an orphan in childhood, for the last 8 years he has made shoes for subsistence, but he aspires to loftier destinies, and is desirous of acquiring the Science of music—to qualify himself for teaching it— This of course requires expence, and he comes to me as a benevolent person to supply his wants— I declined without incivility— Evening visit from Mr George W. Beale— I rode this afternoon with Miss Welsh, Mrs John Adams and the child Arthur.— My wife has a Letter from his father at Lebanon springs, written that day.— I finished reading the second book of Bacon on the advancement of learning; and now I ought to compass the whole extent of the work, but cannot, without reading it over again and again— These two books however on the advancement of learning form a very small part of the Treatise de Augmentis scientiarum, which is in nine Books in the fourth Volume of this Edition, in Latin without any translation, and is itself only the first part of the Instauratio magna, the second part of which is the Novum Organum, like wise in Latin without translation— In the distribution of the Sciences and especially of those which concern the mind there are in this book a multitude of observations upon men and manners which would have been equally if not more appropriate in the Essays. There is in them a depth and compass of intellect admirable, and surprizing; but always some thing louche in the moral aspect.— The plan of the work is original; but the thoughts in detail are all borrowed; and the quotations from the Bible and from Greek and Latin Classics are numberless.

A day which I always welcome with gratitude to Heaven; but which at every return gives warning of nearer approach if not advent of the last. It passed away this time with out notice except in my memory It was a nearly idle day for reading or writing; and this day was still more so— I answered a Letter from Mr Henry Bowers of Scituate, and sent his two Portraits to my Son’s Office N. 23. Court Street Boston— Benjamin went in with the Carriage, and Harriet Welsh returned to Boston alone. In the Evening, my Son and the party with him came back from their excursion to Lebanon, Albany, and the Catskill Mountain All well. Dr Woodward was here, and examined again my contusion— There is yet a hard swelling at the spot on which I fell, and some discolouration of the skin by extravasated blood, down below the ham to the calf of the leg but the discolouration is fading, and the hard swelling abates. Alexander S. Johnson, eldest son of Mr Johnson of Utica, and of my brother Charles’s second daughter, came out with Mr George Thom from Boston; Mr Thom had an engagement in Boston and could not stay to dine— Mr Johnson dined with us, and after dinner I walked with him, first to my Son’s house, whence he surveyed the prospect of Boston harbour, the Boston State house, the Cap of the Boston Light-house, the upper part of the shaft of the Bunker hill Column—the background of the blue hills, and the side view of the Adams Temple, the rising granite town-house, the Hancock lot with the old lime tree in the centre, and the old cellar to the house where John Hancock was born, and the surrounding beautiful village—we then went to the temple, the door of which was open, and sexton in the porch under the belfry, and over the vaults. He had not the key of the vault where my father and mother repose, but Mr Johnson viewed the marble tablet, at the right hand of the pulpit as you go up the central aisle, erected in 1829. with the inscription upon it written by me, and surmounted by the marble bust of my father: the work of Greenough. Thence we proceed to the opposite grave yard, where my name carved on the granite front of my tomb, marks in advance the spot of my last home; and there we visited the four granite Monuments erected by my father to his ancestors Henry, Joseph Senior, Joseph and John who preceded him from the settlement of Mount Wollaston down to his own time— Mr Johnson then returned to Boston—while we were out Mr Robert G. Shaw and his daughter were here as visitors but were gone before we returned— My Son and Mary-Louisa came in at dusk of eve, and President Quincy, and the Revd. Mr Waterston paid us evening visits. "

                "text": "28. IV:30. Sunday.  Dr Pierce of Brookline preached, this morning from a clause in Colossians 3.4. “Christ, who is our life.”— This figure of speech unintelligible in its literal sense was first used by Jesus Christ himself— “I am the resurrection and the life.” the life—not saying whose life— Paul, speaking to the Christians of Colosse says Christ is our life—and in the verse preceding that of the text he says— [“]For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God”—and the whole verse from which the text was taken reads [“]When Christ, our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.”— This Epistle to the Colossians is one of the shortest books of the new Testament, consisting only of 4. short chapters, in which the peculiar Christian doctrine of the atonement is blended with a summary of moral precepts for the regulation of private and domestic life. Dr Pierce considered the assertion in the text that Christ is our life, under five several aspects 1. As Christ is the source 2. the manifestation 3. the hope, 4 the comfort and 5 the resurrection to eternal life. Upon each of these points he made remarks apposite to the text, but from which I could draw no very clear practical conclusion.— It was a dissertation of the old school of which Dr Pierce is one of the oldest patriarchs. A graduate of Harvard of 1793.— He gave notice at the request of Mr Lunt that the communion would be administered next Sunday.— He came home with me, and dined with us.— His afternoon text was from John 19.25. [“]Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.” (Question of construction, was the sister of Jesus’s mother, and Mary the wife of Cleophas the same person, or two persons, and if the same how came the two sisters to be both named Mary?) The motive for the selection of this text seems to have been, to pronounce a magnificent panegyric upon the female sex— I believe the superiority of the female sex in all the social and benevolent virtues, and am not sure that the tribute of the Doctor’s gallantry was out of place. I had scarcely returned from the afternoon service when Mr Degrand came in from Boston, with Mr W. W. Clapp Editor of the Boston Evening Gazette who took tea and spent the evening with us. They visited with me, my garden Nursery and seminary; and witnessed the ruin of my trees.— We had also evening visits from Mr and Mrs G. T. Bigelow, Elizabeth C. Adams, Georgiana Harrod, John and Fanny Foster and Charles Miller. Of course no reading. My Son also spent the Evening here "

Price Greenleaf came in, and walked with me round my grounds. I have lost at least forty peach trees of all ages whether by the frosts of last winter, or the drought of the present summer I cannot tell— Every one of the seedling Oaks of last Summer has perished— One budded Pear stock, and several Apples have thrown out vigorous shoots, but the borer at the root of the stock and the aphis at the top of the shoot prey upon their vitals in concert Mr Alexander S. Johnson came out from Boston in the Noon Stage to spend a week with us. After dinner Mr Beale called on me with Mr Gardiner, the chief surveyor for the projected Old Colony Railroad— They were staking it out, to pass within ten feet east of my eastern most barn—then to cross in oblique line the County-road—traverse centrally my lot in front of my house and the Hancock lot given by my father to the town, and pass close westward of the burying ground.— It would scarcely be possible to carry through a line more injurious to my property, both by the danger of firing my barns and by cutting up into fragments the most valuable lot of land that I possess. But it is useless to complain and idle to remonstrate. While standing out at the corner where they were to pass, a phaeton came along with a gentleman and Lady in it— The man got out, and came up to me, announced himself by the name of Cutler, and said he had been requested by Mr Henry Bowers of Scituate, to make enquiry concerning two Portraits of my father, and President Washington, which he had left with me last year, and he wished to know my opinion of them. I told him that I had received a Letter from Mr Bowers to the same effect which I had answered last Saturday, and according to his request had sent the portraits to my son’s office 23. Court Street Boston— And that I had been so much pleased with the Portraits that I had exact copies of them taken by an eminent Portrait Painter, Mr Marchant for myself— I met there also Harvey Field and John J. Carr, my tenant who lost a Cow last night, he thought by her eating whole apples.— A person by the name of Samuel L. Fiske of Southbridge in the County of Worcester, came and introduced himself as he said solely for the purpose of seeing me, and having to say that he had seen me— Mercy Tufts paid us an afternoon visit— And Mr Stockton the purser in the Navy, with his wife came out from Boston, where he is stationed and took tea with us. I walked up the hill to see Mrs Charles, who has come back from her tour very much fatigued and Charles came home with me and spent the Evening with us— Of the day thus occupied what can I say more—and what became of Bacon?

                "text": "30. IV:30. Tuesday.  The preconcerted current of my daily occupations continues under great perturbation. My Son went to Boston this day, and brought me out a volume of critical and miscellaneous Essays of T. Babington Macaulay, consisting of reprinted articles from the Edinburgh Review— I wanted it for an article upon Lord Bacon, of which I had heard, and which I expect will be satisfactory— It is a review of a new Edition of Bacon’s works in 16 octavo volumes, published 1825–1834. by Basil Montagu— And in the last volume of which there is the desideratum, a new Life of Bacon— I sent an answer to Mr Daniel P. Parker’s invitation to me, to visit the ship which he has called by my name, and promised to go next Saturday, if a fair day. And I wrote an answer to Miss Thaxter’s invitation to me, to attend the anniversary celebration of the 1st. of August, at Hingham— We had a visit this afternoon from Mr Hülsemann the Austrian chargé d’Affaires at Washington; and afterwards one from Mr Loring, who was very urgent in soliciting my attendance at the Hingham celebration of the 1st. of August. I persisted in declining, assigned my lameness from which I have not yet sufficiently recovered, as my principal reason, but hinting at some others, not less monitory to detain me at home.— I told him I had answered with some prolixity Miss Thaxter’s Letter of invitation, and explained my unwillingness to take part in the celebration of this anniversary.— He said he should go to Boston again to-morrow, and on his return in the Evening would stop, and take the letter to Miss Thaxter and deliver it to her.— I began to read the Sylva Sylvarum, or Natural History in ten Centuries: each consisting of 100 experiments— There is a preface to this work by William Rawley, Lord Bacon’s Secretary written for publication before his death, but not published till after that event— He says it was intended as a third part of the Instauration. As a middle link between the De Augmentis Scientiarum, an the Novum Organum— But Bacon hesitated whether to publish it or not during his life time, and it does not appear at all essential to the great work. It is divided into experiments in consort, and experiments solitary; and it has more the appearance of a Cookery book, or collection of Confectioner’s receipts than a philosophical system of Natural history— It begins with experiments of percolation—or the straining and passing of bodies one through another— And the remarkable fact is that he falsifies the result of the experiment. He says dig a pit on the sea shore above high water mark, and sink it below low-water Mark— As the tide flows in, it will fill with fresh and potable water— This is a mistake—the water will not be potable, nor even potable though it will lose many of its saline particles, by evaporation. Charles spent the evening here, but his wife did not come. "

For the first time since my return home I was able to go up the hill and see the Sun rise from the South-east corner of my Son’s house— My Chronometer is 51 minutes in advance of the Sun. It qualifies not a little the pleasure which I experience in witnessing the phenomenon of Sunrise to observe what progress of Southing he has already made from the solstitial point of declination. From this day forward the nights lengthen and the days shorten till the winter solstice, and I must soon rely upon lamplight for the morning hours— I received a note from Mr Loring, that he could not call here this afternoon, as he had promised yesterday— I took therefore the Letter to Miss Thaxter to the Post-Office— It began to sprinkle as I was on my way, and before I got home became a shower followed by others all the remainder of the day, which confined me to the house— Mr A. S. Johnson dined at Mrs T. B. Adams’s. I received a Letter from William Wallace Whitney at New-Orleans, enclosing the Morning Herald of that city of 17. July current— In that paper, there is printed a Letter from the same Whitney to William Cullen Bryant Editor of the New-York Evening Post. It is an elaborate and formal defence and attempted vindication of the character of General Edmund Pendleton Gaines from the charge of rashness in an editorial article of the Evening Post.— In his Letter to me enclosing this paper Mr Whitney refers to my address to my constituents at Braintree of 17. September 1842. in which he says I took occasion to allude to the measures of General Gaines on the Sabine during the Mexican and Sabine War, and as he, Whitney conceives, did him injustice— He therefore calls my attention to the printed Letter and requests a reconsideration of my opinion— The printed Letter is in so small a type that I was obliged to Mr A. S. Johnson for reading it to me; and it will require from me a calm, considerate and spirited answer.— But for this I must take time Charles and his wife and daughter spent the Evening with us.— But all my reading of Bacon is suspended, by Macaulay’s review of Basil Montagu’s edition of his work and Life. The review charges Montagu with a laborious and absurd effort to defend the moral character of Bacon; and the attempt to pass him off as a Spirit as pure as it was bright—but this was a desperate task. Macaulay darts into both extremes—extols the intellect and denigrates the moral qualities in Hyperboles. Bacon was at once an unscrupulous man of the world and sycophant of a royal court, and a profound philosopher— The important events of his life—his slow and gradual ascent to fame, power and honours— His horrible treachery to the Earl of Essex, his base subserviency to the favourite Buckingham; his lamentable downfall and self-sacrifice, and the resignation and perseverance with which he redeemed himself to the veneration of posterity are a theme for continuous meditation and unabating interest.

Mr Hale came as an agent to solicit a contribution for a private establishment for the support and disposal of poor orphan children— It was devised and is maintained by Misses A. and E. C. Fellows in Boston, who publish a quarto periodical journal, styled the Social Monitor and Orphan’s Advocate in Monthly numbers, one of which Mr Hale left with me. He says he was himself an orphan, supported and educated by these persons. Their plan is to withdraw from the poor houses of the country towns such orphan poor as they can find opportunity to provide for by placing them in families where care is taken to educate and maintain them— This is the day of the Anniversary celebration at Hingham— This day the Steam ship Caledonia Captain Lott, arrived at Boston from Liverpool and Halifax in 12 1/2 days with 92 passengers. And the Steamship Hibernia Captain Ryrie, sailed from Boston for Halifax and Liverpool— One calendar month now suffices for writing to London and receiving an answer— I finished reading Macaulay’s Article on Bacon, which I have read with pleasure, but which has kindled my thirst to see and compare Montagu’s edition of his works with that of Mallet which I possess.— and particularly to read Montagu’s life of the compound of Angel and Fiend Francis Bacon— Macaulay judges him with a mixture of excessive rigour and of extreme admiration and kindness. There is a natural alliance between admiration and love—and a natural affinity between contempt and hatred— But between admiration and hatred there is none; and between Love and contempt there may be an easy transition but no union. Macaulay’s estimate of Bacon’s philosophical system and discoveries appear to me to be greatly exaggerated, and his condemnation of the Grecian Philosophy much too broad and universal.— The Stoic, Epicurean, and Platonic philosophies were as full of practical good as the novum organum. When Pythagoras sacrificed a hecatomb, for having discovered the relative measure of the right angle and the hypothenuse, it was not the mathematical abstraction that caused his joy.— When Archimedes said to Hiero give me a stand I will move the earth, it was not a barren problem of mechanics of which he boasted. The sayings of the wise men—the golden verses—the inductive reasoning of Socrates were all eminently practical and useful— Bacon proposed a new method of study, and disparaged too much that which preceded him. While I have been reading Macaulay Bacon himself slumbers. I have fallen into idle habits— I rise about 4. Wash, scrub and curry one hour—read first permanent matter—then Newspapers and pamphlets which come by Mail— Journalize 3 hours—searching for papers at intervals till 2. dine. Afternoon Siesta two hours— Yawn, and range about the house and garden till Sunset— Tea— Evening with my family. "

                "text": "2. III:30. Friday.  My Son with Alexander S. Johnson, and Charles’s sons John and Charles went this morning on a fishing party to Cohasset— They returned before dinner and I dined with Mr Johnson at Charles’s— I wrote to Mrs Harriet Boyd at Green Bay, Wiskonsin Territory, authorising her with her husband to draw upon me for 80. dollars payable at one day’s sight at the Merchant’s Bank Boston—being for her portion of the balance of the proceeds of sale of Mr T. B. Johnson’s effects directed by the judge of the orphan’s Court at Washington to be distributed between his sisters.— I answered also the invitation of Mr B. R. Curtis to attend at the Meeting of the Alumni of Harvard University the day before Commencement, and to preside at their dinner— I declined though with a very strong inclination to accept— And I wrote to Mr George Fuller, Administrator of the Estate of Moses Gill; requesting him to transfer to the Executors of the Will and Trustees of Ward Nicholas Boylston, seven shares of the stock of the Pennsylvania Bank of the United States, of the 25 which I transferred to him last April. A great part of this day was absorbed in looking up loose pamphlet documents of which I have immense multitudes in such disorder and confusion that whenever I want any one of them it is like seeking one grain of wheat in a bushel of chaff—a desolating search three times out of four terminating in disappointments, and loss of the time.— With the design of answering Mr William Wallace Whitney’s Letter, I recurred to my Address to my Constituents at Braintree on the 17th of September 1842— I soon found the passage containing the statements and opinions which Mr Whitney requests me to reconsider— It was the charge that in 1836. President Jackson expressly authorised General Gaines to invade the Mexican territory—and take post at Nacogdoches which he did.— I find throughout the whole passage no charge against General Gaines, but I did not state in my address, the equivocating disavowal by Jackson in Secretary Forsyth’s Letter to the Mexican Minister Gorostiza of 10. May 1836. of Gaines’s actual occupation of Nacogdoches. Of that disavowal Mr Whitney takes no notice in his Letter to Bryant Editor of the New-York Evening Post—a disingenuous omission which must not be suffered to pass without exposure— But for that purpose I must review the whole series of transactions of that period, and especially the whole controversy respecting the Gorostiza pamphlet— In this pursuit I passed from my Address at Braintree, to my fragment speech of June and July 1838. where I charged upon Jackson’s administration these escroceries of his conduct towards Mexico, and once engaged in the reperusal of that Speech the leisure of the day was consumed— Mr Lunt was here this afternoon— And Walter Hellen arrived from Washington.

                "text": "4. IV. Sunday.  Communion day. Mr Lunt’s morning text was from 1. Peter 3. [“]For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: 19 by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison.” It was a discourse preparatory to the administration of the communion— The verse immediately preceding the text says “For, it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.” an admirable principle of morals, and well deserving to be itself the text of a whole sermon— Mr Lunt said that the Apostle Peter must have had an acute sense of the difference between these two modes of suffering— He had suffered for evil-doing, when he forsook his lord and Master in the last scene of his life; and he was to suffer for well-doing, when he died a martyr to the Christian cause— There is something obscure, and which seems to require explanation in the assertion that Christ after his crucifixion went and preached unto the Spirits in prison— The main argument of the epistle is an earnest exhortation to all the disciples of Christ to follow his example by suffering, not only without swerving from the path of righteousness, but by persevering in that of active beneficence. In the administration of the Communion an affecting incident occurred by the appearances of the two new Deacons to distribute the bread and wine in the place of the two who for several years past had performed that service—Savil and William Spear— After the Meeting I began to walk home, but was overtaken by a sudden shower of which the water fell in a flood, and I was driven to take refuge in the carriage which was taking home Louisa Smith and Mrs Charles. Even that barely saved me from a drenching.— Mr Bigelow handed me as we were coming out of the Temple a very urgent invitation from Jonathan Chapman Chairman of the Whig State central Committee, to attend and preside at a Mass Convention of the Whigs of Massachusetts upon Boston Common, on Thursday the 19th. of September next, and said he would call on me for an answer this evening— I attended meeting this afternoon alone— Mr Lunts text was from 2. Corinthians 7.1. the last line of the verse—“perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” The doctrine of the discourse was that the fear of God, that is Religion is the exclusive and only foundation of perfect virtue; a principle which I hold to be certain though perfect virtue does not always follow from religious faith. This Sermon was well written, well reasoned, and well delivered. I preferred it to the one of the morning. The fear of God is the sum total of the Old Testament— The immortality of the Soul is the vital essence of the New— From these two articles of faith necessarily follows the responsibility of Man, the only guarantee of human virtue. Mr and Mrs G. T. Bigelow and Mrs John Angier visited us this Evening. Mr Bigelow undertook to deliver my verbal answer to Mr Chapman’s invitation declining to preside at the Mass Meeting of whigs on Boston Common— Age and infirmity admit of no composition— Mrs Elizabeth Cranch was so unwell that she could not come down to dinner— But she revived in the Evening.

Alexander Smith Johnson eldest surviving son, of my deceased niece, youngest daughter of my brother Charles, after spending a week with us, left us this morning, to return to the city of New-York, where he resides, and is a practising lawyer— He was born 30 July 1817. at Utica, and was educated at Yale College (See my diary of 1. June 1830. Vol. 10. p. 466.) The Revd Dr Storrs of Braintree paid us a morning visit with his wife and sister— I called at the Quincy stone bank, and deposited there 20 Eagles and 20 half Eagles which I had received at the Bank of the Metropolis at Washington—reflecting that a deposit there of gold coin, is far safer than in my own house. After dinner, Mr George Warren, a member of the Boston Mercantile Library Association came and urgently invited me, to deliver the introductory Lecture to the course which they propose to commence next October— I had hoped to be spared the annoyance of these applications by my card in the National Intelligencer ofJuly last, but they are more numerous than ever. I told Mr Warren that I could make no engagement, but would deliver a Lecture if I should find it in my power— Mr Loring of Hingham and his wife were also here—and I promised to go with him to a fishing party at Cohasset, on Thursday of next week— Three times this afternoon I sat down to continue writing my proposed address to my Constituents—and wrote not more than five lines— Read not a single concerted or solitary experiment of Bacon’s Natural History, nor one page of Macaulay’s Miscellaneous articles from the Edinburgh Review— Great part of the day was consumed in overhauling my pamplets putting them into confusion worse confounded, and hunting up 25 of my own composition of which I made a parcel and gave it to Alexander S. Johnson— I made out last summer a list of 72 Miscellanies in print by me, which on looking over now I find very deficient.— In American State Papers collected by Lowrie and Clark and published by Gales and Seaton in 21 volumes folio, the first four contain the Documents relating to foreign Affairs, and of these there are in the fourth volume many written by me— My hand is in almost every collection of the Session of Congress documents from year to year for the last 30 years, and not unfrequently before— I rise so early that in reading or writing I find myself oppressed by drowsiness, and compelled to quit my table for more stirring occupation— I then begin to ransack my old papers, which wakes me up, but consumes my time, and dissipates my thoughts. I have also resorted to the practice of taking a Siesta after dinner which makes up for the shortness of my sleeping hours at Night. But it is a subtle thief of Life. "

Set beclouded  I am so far relieved from my lameness that I can walk without spraining my leg— I went up the hill and saw the Sun rise from the East corner of Charles’s house—not quite clear, but so that I could mark the first beam of his appearance above the horizon.— I filled earthen pot N. 3. with earth and planted in it 3. Washington red plumstones; as I had done in each of the other two— I took other morning exercise of an hour, my health recreation and apology for wasted time— There are four stocks, budded last Summer by E Price Greenleaf, 3 apple and one Pear, which have put forth shoots, the pear 3 feet 9 inches—the apple in front of my study window 2. feet—that in Fanny’s plat 28 inches—that in Mary Louisa’s plat 21 inches— The stalks of all the apples stunted by the congregaiton of green aphides and black ants. There are seven shag-bark walnuts up in the bed behind the tool box up, from my last fall’s plantation— I would gladly save them from the frosts of next winter, but know not how. Mr Lunt called, having already returned the 2d. volum of my miscellanies which I have given to my grand daughter Mary Louisa— He told me he had been pleased with my essay on the character of Desdemona, but did not concur with my opinion of her— I asked him on what point he differed.— He said on the point that the colour of Othello constitutes the Tragedy, and on my rigorous estimate of the character of Desdemona— But he was not disposed to discuss, and I did not press for it— He said there was a man at work in the graveyard engraving on the ministerial monument the name of Mrs. Anna Fiske second wife of the Revd. Moses Fiske, and before that, widow of Daniel Quincy, and mother of John Quincy whose name I bear— She was my great-great-grand-mother—my trisayenle, and I revere her memory as if she were mother. That she was buried in this Tomb, is ascertained by an extract from Fairfields Journal quoted in Mr Lunt’s two centennial Discourses— Mr Lunt had a list of my published miscellanies, which he gave me, requesting me to revise and correct it— This has stimulated me to re-examine the immense mass of my pamphlets and old Congressional documents which appals me as I proceed. Walter Hellen offers to assist me and this day we made some progress, but a whole month will not suffice for the task. I this day found at last the collections which I had made last Summer, and preceding Seasons, of my own miscellanies, to give to my son, and others of my relatives and friends— That for my Son contains a number sufficient to make four large volumes for binding—and there are scattered about in newspapers and other public journals an ample number to make up four volumes more; besides manuscripts numberless. I received this day Letters from William H. Seward and Christopher Morgan of Auburn, New-York, inviting me to write for publication a Letter on the subject of the annexation of Texas to the Union; and an invitation from George Bliss, George Dwight and Henryinviting me to a whig mass Convention at Springfield on the 9th.

Mr Enos White of Weymouth came this morning to solicit a contribution for surrounding with a fence, and putting into some order the grave yard of the parish of which my grandfather William Smith was many years the Pastor— There he, and his wife Elizabeth Quincy, my Grandmother and Dr Cotton Tufts, and his wife Lucy Quincy, my Grandmother’s sister, and their son Cotton, all lie buried— In that spot in October 1775. I attended the funeral of my Grandmother.— And there on the 6th. of May 1833 I attended the funeral of Cotton Tufts the son. I told Mr White that in the Summers of 1774 and 1775. I had lived several months in the house of my Grandfather at Weymouth, and he and his wife seemed to me, as a second father and mother. When last there I had seen the Stones over the graves of my grand parents, and would cheerfully contribute to a fencing round the enclosure, and other reparations for the protection of the place from insult— Mr Daniel Greenleaf paid a morning visit to me, and to Mrs Elizabeth Cranch now the wife of his nephew Christopher Pierce Cranch. Mr Greenleaf is 83 years of age, and so deaf, that it is difficult to hold a conversation with him—and Mrs Cranch is so infirm in health, that it is doubtful whether she will out live him.— She and Mary-Louisa dined this day at Mrs Adams’s my brother Thomas’s widow.— My wife received a Letter from Mrs Treadway at Richmond— Her daughter Mrs Crane has lost the fine boy whom she had with her when they visited us in August 1842. I received this day a Letter from Rufus King and 4 others of the State, Clay Central Committee at Albany, New-York, inviting and urging me to write for publication a Letter upon Texas— The Letter received yesterday from W. H. Seward and Morgan, was in aid of this request. Also a Letter from M. M. Fisher of Medway, requesting in behalf of the District and County Committee of the Liberty party of the Eighth Congregational Distric of Massachusetts, a conference with me next Monday, in relation to the nomination of a Candidate to represent the District in the 29th. Congress— And a Letter from George Fuller, administrator de bonis non, with the will annexed of Lieutt. Governor Moses Gill, respecting the 7 Bank shares which I transferred to him by mistake. I wrote on the back of the Deed of the Congregational Society of the Town of Quincy by their Treasurer George W. Beale, to me, of Pew N. 6 in the Stone Temple, an assignment of all my right, title and Estate therein to Benjamin R. Curtis, his heirs and Assigns— Much of the day wasted in ransacking the farm house for old documents and pamphlets. "

His wife and my granddaughter Mary Louisa went with him. They returned home to dine, and Charles brought out the 61st. volume of Niles’s Register, containing page 219. Clement C. Clay’s Letter to the Legislature of the State of Alabama of 12. Novr. 1841. resigning his seat in the Senate of the United States—in which he recommends emphatically the political doctrine of Thomas Jefferson, that the Northern Democracy are the natural allies of the Slaveholders of the South— I have long been desirous of referring to the Letter of Mr Jefferson in which this principle was avowed; an also to an Article in the North-American Review, by Edward Everett commenting upon it— Charles brought out the 4th. Volume of Jefferson’s writings, and the 22d volume of the North American Review where I expected to find these Articles. In my searches this day with Walter Hellen for old documents and pamphlets at the farm-house I found the anonymous pamphlet published by John Forsyth Secretary of State in 1837. entitled “Examination and Review of a pamphlet, printed and secretly circulated by M. E. Gorostiza, late Envoy Extraordinary from Mexico; previous to his departure from the United States; and by him entitled ‘Correspondence between the Legation Extraordinary of Mexico, and the Department of State of the United States, respecting the passage of the Sabine, by the Troops under the command of General Gaines[’”]— I had alread found, a loose copy of the Message of President Van Buren to H.R.U.S. of 26. Feby 1838; containing a copy and translation of Gorostiza’s pamphlet; in answer to a Resolution offered by me, and adopted by the House on the 20th. of February 1838— These two pamphets are indispensably necessary to me, for the preparation of my answer to Mr Whitney. Also the Session Message of 24. Congress 2d. Session 6. December 1836. wherein President Jackson disavows the entry by General Gaines upon the Mexican Territory. Also Messages of 27. April and 4 July 1838. N. 351. 25 Congress 2. Session—especially from p. 765 of the latter.— At page 766. there is a Letter from Genl. Macomb to Gaines of 26. January 1836.—enclosing a Letter of Instructions from the Secretary of War dated 23. January 1836— These were the precise orders upon which Gaines crossed the Sabine and took Post at Nacogdoches—but the Instructions themselves are not there They were communicated to the House in the Message of 14 May 1836. 24. Congress 1. Session. N. 256. in answer to a Resolution of the House of 10. May 1836 on a motion of Edward Everett the day before. The instructions are obscurely worded, and do not give explicit authority to cross the line— That however is given by Letter from the Secretary of War of 25. April 1836. five days after the conference between Forsyth and Gorostiza, when the Mexican Minister was apprized of the intention of Jackson to authorize the invasion of Mexico by Gaines. "

Set 7.10 beclouded  I awake now habitually before the Clock in our entry strikes 3. and cannot sleep again— I lay an hour more or less and rise with the first glimpse of twilight. At this when the sky is clear, I see every night just before going to bed between 10. and 11. the planet Jupiter rise in the North east, about the extremest Northern declination of the Sun; and at half past 3. in the morning. Venus rises nearly at the same point— It seems as if it were the same star night and morning; fixed in the heavens, with unceasing and unfading splendor. I suppose that not one person in a thousand would understand me should I say that this incident has given and continues to give me a transient sensation of pleasure. I resumed the practice of allowing two hours of morning exercise, devoted to my seedling trees. I planted two Washington plum stones in a plat in the Seminary, next the Barn fence, and covered them with an inverted earthen flower pot, bottom broken off. The summer house cellar was choked up with weeds, from 3. to 5. feet high. I plucked and hoed them up; and disclosed 2 seedling shagbark trees, up from last years nuts of the old adjoining tree— Mr G. W. Beale called here, and I acknowledged before him as a Justice of Peace, the Assignment to Benjamin R. Curtis of pew N. 6, in the Stone Temple— Mrs John Adams, and Mrs Cranch, dined at Mr Daniel Greenleaf’s— Mr and Mrs Erastus Brooks, (Margaret Cranch) and Mrs Lucy Dawes were here this afternoon— Charles and his wife and daughter, this Evening.— This day the Railway from New-York to Boston, by the way of Long Island was first opened, and I note from the Atlas Newspaper the time within which the journey was performed.

My morning exercise encroaches already upon my hours for labour, and the search for old documents and pamphlets absorbs time beyond all computation— I worked this morning upon an old Apple tree in the alley between my own and Charles’s house, and which bears Russetton Apples I propose to strip off its parasite ulcers, and loosen the ground about its roots— Mrs Elizabeth (De Windt) Cranch who has been spending a week with us, left us, to go and pass another with Mrs John Angier at Medford, and then return to her father’s house at Cedar grove, Fishkill Landing, on Hudson river— Mary and her daughter Mary Louisa went with her to Boston and returned home to dine— Charles A. Cummings, heretofore a School-teacher, and in 1840 Selectman of Quincy, a fierce democrat called on me this morning with a Revd Mr Goodrich a Minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church to solicit a subscription for building a new church of that denomination in this town— There is already a church of the same denomination near Quincy point— Mr Goodrich belongs to the Providence Conference, and the town of Quincy falls within that jurisdiction. Mr Goodrich was appointed by the Conference to preach here, but the proprietor, of the church or of the pews refused to receive him, and will not permit him to occupy the Church. And so Mr Cummings gets up a contribution to build another— I declined on the ground that this was a family quarrel, with which Strangers should not interfere, but which the parties should settle by amicable consultation, or by appeal to the Laws of the Land.— They said they supposed that the right of possession of the Church must ultimately be decided by a suit at Law, and they would have to commence an action— But that would necessarily consume a year, and perhaps two before the final decision, and in the mean time, they had no place where they could perform their devotions— I persevered in declining the contribution A man by the name of Horatio Green, an itinerant Cabinet maker traveling about the Country in search of work came to see me for the mere sake of curiosity, because he makes it a practice to go and see all the great men whenever they fall in his way.— He made some slight apology for intrusion, but gave me to understand that he considered it a clear right for any labourer to visit all the great men, and talk politics with them ad libitum.— He entered accordingly, upon the Tariff and the Bank and Texas and Tyler, the burden of all which was that the whole burden of taxation ought to be brought to bear, upon the wealthy; and that the labourer ought to have light work and heavy wages.— This is genuine democracy, and the universal feeling of the masses— The rest of the day was swallowed up in unpacking the three chests of books and papers which came round by Sea from Washington, and in which with a fresh multitude of documents to assort, I miss two or three articles indispensable to complete sets.

                "text": "11. III.30. Sunday  Sun rose beclouded— Set 5.3.  Mr Young, pastor of the New South Church Boston, exchanged this day with Mr Lunt, and preached this morning from Psalm 4:6. “There be many that say, who will shew us any good?”— He observed that it was considered as evidence of a discontented and complaining spirit in those who were apt to indulge themselves with this question— As if they felt the gift of life as a burden, and not a blessing. Mr Young took only this clause of the verse for his text— The first Sermon of Sterne published under the name of Yorick, is on this subject; but he adds to the text the latter clause of the verse— “Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.”— Sterne begins by a general assertion of a propensity in mankind to search for happiness—which position he diversifies, by reference to the modifications of the pursuit, by men in the several conditions of life— Mr Young dwelt on the unreasonableness and ingratitude of repining at the allotments of life, and enumerated the sources of enjoyment common to all men— He argued much on the theory of the optimist school, and insisted that many of the incidents which are dreaded as evils turn out to be blessings in disguise— Sterne’s argument is that all the usual pursuits of happiness terminate in disappointment— Both come to the same conclusion, that the real good, the consummate enjoyment of human life can be found only in religion.— The second part of the verse, omitted by Mr Young, but included in Sterne’s text is exceedingly appropriate to that argument. Mr Young came home with me, and dined with us. I mentioned Sterne’s sermon to him; but he did not seem to be acquainted with it. He did not howeve say that he had never seen it— His text in the afternoon was Proverbs 13.11. “Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.” This is an aphorism of private morality, not in the form of a precept but a statement of cause and effect—invariable as the laws of physical Nature. three thousand years ago, the experience of mankind had proved uniformly so, and Solomon made a proverb of it— Wealth gotten by Vanity— The words Vanity—and diminished, are to be noted for their significancy— The French Genevan translation, instead of Vanity, uses Fraud— Charles Thomson has “injustice.”— The term Vanity is more comprehensive and includes wealth acquired suddenly—by chance, by gaming—by any other mode than laborious Industry; and the experience of mankind still after the lapse of thirty centuries witnesses the same results. Mr Young visited with severity the propensity of young American women to form matrimonial connections with foreigners, especially if they have the title of Count, which he said was as common in some parts of Europe, as that of Esquire, or Captain here— At Charles’s house to see the Sun set, I met there Mr and Mrs George T. Bigelow— Something said of the mass Meeting of 10 or 15000 whigs at Springfield last Friday; where Robert C. Winthrop, Rufus Choate and Daniel Webster made Speeches. "

I gave precisely two hours to bodily exercise, my seedlings and the old apple-tree in the lane— I expected the visit of Mr M. M. Fisher and the deputation from the Liberty party Committee but they did not come— The Revd. Peter Sanborn, and Mr. Moses Welsh of Reading, Middlesex County paid me a morning visit. Mr Sanborn said he was a Minister of the word of God, and preached yesterday for Mr Perkins at Braintree— He was making an excursion for his health and amusement, and accompanied his friend Mr Welsh who came to visit some of his Relations at Weymouth. He was a few months older than me.— He had a great veneration for all the Patriots of our Revolution, and La Fayette had shaken him most cordially by the hand. He was much inclined to talk politics—said he was of the Liberty party—asked me, if Mr Clay was really the cause of the Cilley duel—and whether he should vote for Mr Birney.— I told him that I could say nothing about Mr Clay’s concern in the Cilley, or any other duel, but that I was very sorry he had ever taken part in any one: and that if he should vote for Birney, his vote would count for Polk.— His friend Welsh very earnestly desired him to remember that— I called at the Office of the Quincy Patriot to enquire if Mr Green had a copy or two left of the pamphlet edition of my Letter of 4 July 1843. to the Anti Slavery Committee at Bangor; but Green was not there, and his journeyman had been only a short time at the Office and knew nothing about it— Then I looked in at the Office of the Quincy Aurora, to enquire if Mr Clapp proposed to publish an account of the celebration at Hingham on the 2d. of this month. He said he had my Letter to Miss Anna Quincy Thaxter already in type for next Thursday— Mrs De Windt has published another book called Melzinga A Souvenir by C. A. D. 1845. consisting of what is called a Journal, a sort of mystical narrative of incidents of daily occurrence dated from time to time in measured lines of unequal length, with and without rhyme, half verse half prose Then sundry miscellaneous fugitive pieces original and selected, among which are my lines upon Retrospection written in September 1840. and which I thought were irretrievably lost— My Letter to her of 31. Octr. 1841. with the tale of Charles the fifths Clocks, and my Sonnet to the Sun-dial—this last somewhat mutilated by misprints. I resumed the daily reading of a few pages of Bacon’s Sylva-Sylvarum, or a natural history in ten centuries— I have read the first century, or one hundred experiments upon percolation— It reads like a Cookery Book, or a compilation of recipes, or quack medicines. It is hard to read, and must be taken in broken doses. I strongly suspect that the results of Many of the experiments are fallacious. Mrs T. B. Adams and two Misses Harrod took tea and spent the Evening here— Mary was taken unwell last Friday; and this day took to her chamber and bed— Dr Woodward here. "

I medicated my old Apple-tree; and hoed up and manured my Nursery seedling plats to the end of my two hours, but felt the sprain of my right leg as a warning to suspend for a time that part of my labours— Miss Samson the Seamstress has been here working for the ladies since yesterday morning. Mary had been quite ill since last Friday, but had said nothing of it, nor taking any advice till yesterday after breakfast, when able to sustain herself no longer Dr. Woodward was sent for and ordered her to keep her bed. Two Gentlemen, whigs,  from Lancaster Pennsylvania visited me for curiosity sake and talked of course politics and about the Presidential Election In the midst of a heated canvas Henry A. Muhlenberg the democratic Polk and Dallas candidate for the Office of Governor of Pennsylvania died suddenly of apoplexy, some ten days since— Mr Locher says that the democratic nomination in place of Muhlenberg, will be Mr Shunk, a stronger man, and more likely to succeed than Muhlenberg. Henry Hardwick came and wants to purchase about an Acre and a quarter of my land adjoining his— He has coveted it many years but has never measured it to let me know what he wants nor made me a specific offer for it— I told him he must do both, and he said he would— Mr Peter C. Brooks came out from Medford with his Niece Miss Phillips to spend a couple of days with his daughter— Walter Hellen and I dined with him at Charles’s house; and we sat two full hours after dinner, retracing the steps of time, and calling up the shadows of departed years— We took a walk towards Sunset, around Charles’s hill, and looked at the Boston State-house, the Bunker hill column Boston Harbour, and the cap of the State-house at its mouth— Evening at home— I found the Volume of the Journal of U.S. House of Representatives for 1822, and what I wanted in it; but not time to write it out. I am reading the second century of Lord Bacon’s Sylva Sylvarum, which is upon Music— Curious experiments— But if this work, the Nine Books de Augmentis Scientiarum and the Novum Organum are all component parts of the Instauratio magna they form a strangely constructed book— Dr. Rowley’s preface first purports to be published in Bacon’s life time, and concludes after his death.

I sent the note before six O’Clock this morning to the Post-Office, to go by the morning Stage to Hingham— Mr French, sent me back word that the Stage was gone but that he would send my Letter this morning to Mr Loring. Dr Woodward was here to Mrs John Adams whose complaint continues unabated.— I received a Letter from Jacob Tuck corresponding Secretary of the Total abstinence Society at Cohasset, informing me that there would be a great Temperance gathering there to morrow; and that the Committee of Arrangements, having heard that I should be at Cohasset were anxious that I should be present if I could find it convenient any part of the day.— I supposed my note to Mr Loring would serve for an answer to Mr Tuck— Mr Brooks called to see me. We had hoped to have him to dine with us this day, but the illness of Mrs John Adams disappointed us.— Before dinner Mr Brooks, my Son and myself rode to the stone quarries and saw three of the four fluted pilasters, with their caps of the Ionic Order in preparation for the town Hall which they are building opposite the Stone Temple— The fourth of the pilasters was at the hall about to be raised— One of the workmen said it took sixty days to flute one of the pilasters. They are 20 feet long.— We were obliged to hasten home, which we reached just in time to escape a heavy shower of rain— I found the sinews of my right leg so much strained that I walked with difficulty and pain. Walter Hellen and I dined again at my Son’s with Mr Brooks and Miss Phillips. After dinner Mr William Minot, and Isaac P. Davis came out from Boston; and finding I was not at home, joined us at Charles’s, where they took tea and returned to Boston— I spent the evening with Mr Brooks at my Son’s— Mr Minot spoke of a Speech of Thomas H. Benton at Boonville, published in the National Intelligencer of last Monday—his last blast against the annexation Treaty— And I. P. Davis told me that Tyler’s Madisonian had a violent attack upon me for my Letter to Miss Anna Quincy Thaxter, which it calls a Letter to Miss Anna Thayer— Webster and Winthrop at Springfield, took the proper tone for treating the Texas plot— I wrote the Letter to Miss Thaxter expressly to raise a blister— It is becoming public—but has been printed only in the Atlas of all the Boston Newspapers My time is yet most distressingly absorbed— I finished reading the second and began the third century of Bacon’s Sylva Sylvarum.— The two Books consist of experiments upon music and the motions of Sounds— It is more than half a century since I first read Bacon’s Essays— Would that I had then read three times over all his works. I might then have derived great benefit from them; for the Essays were not barren. But now—all reading to me is percolation—or Sound. "

Brooks, and his Niece Miss Phillips returned home to Medford this morning, and my Son went into Boston, with his Son John Quincy to have him entered as a scholar at the Latin town School, which he did after a sharp examination— The term of study, is of five years, of preparation to enter the University.— May I implore a blessing upon this event—and for this boy? How much of Hope and how much of Fear mingles in every glance at the future— The Soul must rely upon him whose tender mercies are over all his works— Shortly after breakfast Mr Loring came in from Hingham to enquire what had become of me. He had not received the note which I had sent yesterday morning with entire confidence that he would receive it before Noon. After waiting for me this morning nearly two hours, he came to see if some disaster had befallen me— I told him of my second accident and regretted his disappointment and my own. He urged me to come over to the dinner, or to the evening tea-party; but I thought it most prudent to decline.— Towards evening, Dr Codman came in with his Son, returning from the Cohasset fishing party— The day he said had been fine, but the fishing not very successful— They had only caught about 50 haddock— No Cod.— Miss Susan Tufts paid us also an afternoon visit. She was of the Weymouth Committee appointed to confer with me about the fitting up of the parish cemetery. She had declined to come over with Mr Enos White, but she now came by herself, and intimated what she supposed was desired, and perhaps expected of me.— Mr and Mrs Grinnell of New Bedford also paid us a visit; returning from an excursion to Saratoga Springs which they left the day before yesterday morning.— I rode this afternoon with Louisa C. Smith, Mrs Charles and her youngest boy Arthur to Mount Wollaston, and to Germantown which I take a sober and chastised pleasure in visiting once at least every year— Finished reading the third Century of Bacon’s Sylva Sylvarum. “We have laboured, as may appear in this inquisition of sounds diligently: both because sound is one of the most hidden portions of nature, as we said in the beginning, and because it is a virtue which may be called incorporeal and immateriate: whereof there be in nature but few. Besides we were willing, now, in these our first centuries, to make a pattern or precedent, of an exact inquisition; and we shall do the like, hereafter, in some other subjects which require it. For we desire that men should learn, and perceive how severe a thing the true inquisition of nature is; and should accustom themselves by the light of particulars to enlarge their minds to the amplitude of the world, and not reduce the world to the narrowness of their minds.[”]  Bacon’s Sylva sylvarum— Century 3.

My only excursion from our house to the porch of Charles’s to see the Sun set—but he went down in a thick cloud and disappointed me. But the day was fully occupied. I resumed the writing of an Address to my Constituents one daily page of which with one of Diary is all that I can accomplish— Charles brought me a bond to execute with him as his surety; to the judge of probate for the County of Suffolk, with a penalty of sixty thousand dollars, as trustee by the Will of Thomas B. Johnson for the annuities to his Sisters; which I signed, requesting Charles to furnish me, with a copy of it— I read the fourth century of Bacon’s experiments in consort and experiments solitary of the Sylva Sylvarum— This century is upon acceleration—and begins with Experiments in consort, touching the clarification of liquors and the accelerating thereof— “Acceleration of time, in works of Nature, may well be esteemed inter Magnalia naturae. And even in divine miracles, accelerating of the time is next to the creating of the matter”— This observation introduces the book one remarkable feature of which is that it accredits the Alchemist fable of transmuting metals into gold N 326. is an experiment solitary touching the making of gold— He says, “by occasion of handling the axioms touching maturation, we will direct a trial, touching the maturing of metals, and thereby turning some of them into gold; for we conceive indeed, that a perfect good concoction, or digestion, or maturation of some metals. will produce gold[”]— 328. is an experiment solitary touching the nature of gold.— “Gold hath these natures; greatness of weight; closeness of parts, fixation; pliantness or softness; immunity from rust, colour or tincture of yellow. Therefore the sure way, though most about to make gold, is to know the causes of the several natures before rehearsed, and the axioms concerning the same. For if a man can make a metal that hath all these properties, let men dispute whether it be gold or no?[”]— There is also in this book an Experiment solitary touching chameleons. 360— [“]They have a foolish tradition in magic, that if a chameleon be burnt upon the top of an house, it will raise a tempest: supposing, according to their vain dreams of sympathies, because he nourisheth with air, his body should have great virtue to make impression upon the air.” Was it worth while to record such experiments as that?— Again. 399. [“]The heat of the Sun maketh men black in some Countries, as in Æthiopia and Guiney &c. Fire doth it not, as we see in glass men that are continually about the fire”— And read the rest of this precious experiment. By way of relief, I read Macaulay’s Review of Croker’s Edition, of Boswell’s life of Johnson— Paradox mounted upon stilts. Boswell was the most contemptible of human beings, and his book is the best book that ever was published—but Mr Croker has spoiled it— The tree must no longer be judged by its fruit. "

I ventured out this morning to see the Sunrise, and visit my seedling trees.— But the scraping of the skin under my knee was not healed, and in the course of the day became some what inflamed, and the leg swollen. A small plaister of diaculum salve applied this afternoon covered the wound and allayed the inflammation— Charles took his son John to Boston, for a visit to Mr Grinnell—at New-Bedford. The day was oppressively warm, and I sought refuge from dejection of spirits in reading Bacon’s fifth century of experiments, and Macaulay’s Review of Lord Nugent’s Memorials of John Hampden. My afternoon writing hours were absorbed by a visit from Mr Ellis of Dedham, laden with enquiries about the claims of Amasa Dunbar, and William Barron, of which I could give him but an indifferent account.— I recurred to the House Journal of the last Session, and found the case of Amasa Dunbar, first referred to the Committee of Revolutionary pensions, and then a report by Mr Rathbun, moving the discharge of the Committee from the further consideration of this and sundry other claims, and the papers laid on the table. Of the case of William Barron I could give him no account, but that the Committee had reported against it— I mark these cases in the margin to be remembered at the next Session, if my life and health are spared to be there. For the continuous remembrance of the course of private claims and petitions is among the most arduous and burdensome duties of the public service. Charles and his wife spent the evening here— The fifth century of experiments is an enquiry of plants or vegetables—of excellent and general use for food, medicine, and a number of mechanical arts— Acceleration of germination putting back or retardation of germination— Melioration of fruits, trees and plants. Compound fruits and flowers.— Sympathy and antipathy of plants; and making herbs and fruits medicinable, are the titles of the experiments, all in consort of this century. Many of them may be made useful; but many of them are experiments to be made; and I have neither the time, the materials nor the talent to make them. Some are given, with doubt or denial of the result; and the assignment of causes seldom is satisfactory.— Frequent reference is made to what he calls the spirits of plants trees and flowers, and heat and cold, and moist and dry, and harsh and soft are attributed to them as vital properties— I am puzzled with the multitude of specific names of fruits and flowers and plants which I never knew, or have totally forgotten. The same remarks are applicable to the musical instruments and technical musical terms of preceding centuries. The first remark on the Review of Lord Nugent’s Memorials of John Hampden is the fierce Republican Spirit in which it is written— The reverential and apologetic tone in behalf of the republican cause, and the bitterness of invectives against James and Charles and Laud, and Strafford, and the whole breed of the Stuarts.

The wound below my knee continues to fester and inflame The tendon of my right leg is yet sore and painful and a discolouring of extravasated blood appears below the outer ankle bone.— I was obliged to ride to and from meeting both morning and afternoon, and walking was more painful to me than it had yet been. On going to bed this evening I resolved to try the effect of a bread and milk poultice to the knee— Mr Waterston is ordained as a Minister at large, and officiates at the Pitts Street Chapel in Boston. He exchanged this day with Mr Lunt, and preached this morning from Matthew 24.12. “And because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold.”— Mr Waterston is a young man, warm hearted, and enthusiastic in the cause of evangelical religion and of his Country.— The text is part of the chapter in which Jesus shortly before his crucifixion prepared his disciples for the persecutions and sufferings which they were to endure for the preaching of the gospel— He foretold the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem— He gives warning to the disciples that there shall be Wars and rumours of wars—that Nations shall rise up against Nation, and kingdom against kingdom.— That they the disciples shall be delivered up to be afflicted, and be killed, and be hated of all nations for his name’s sake—that many should be offended, and betray one another, and hate one another— And for all this he adds because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold—but then he adds—he that shall endure unto the end, shall be saved— And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all Nations: and then shall the end come.— The prediction has been verified in all its parts except the coming of the end, which is not yet consummated. The gospel is not yet consummated— Even yet iniquity abounds, and the love of many waxes cold.— The sincere and righteous Christian suffers not his love to wax cold—he sees iniquity abound, and some betray, and some desert and some wax cold— The voice of the Saviour has told him that the end shall come, and what end shall be.— The Christian waits in fervent faith and humble hope, and all embracing Charity, for the universal emancipation of the race, ready to promote it to the utmost of his power: and knowing if it must be atchieved through blood and slaughter and exterminating War, it will be because the Supreme Ruler of the world shall have ordained that so it shall be.— After dinner Mr Waterstons text was Exodus 14.15. “And the Lord said unto Moses, wherefore criest thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward.” A brief reference to the condition of the children of Israel, at the time when this injunction was laid upon them introduced a parallel between their undertaking and the burden upon the Soul of the Christian at this day—and he impressively exhorted his hearers, not only to be solicitous of sound opinions and virtuous principles, but to follow them up by going forward— President Quincy, and Mr Waterston spent the Evening with us. The Steamer Acadia arrived at 3 O’Clock this afternoon from Liverpool, with 109. Passengers, among whom was the Ex-Governor John Davis. "

They chiefly consist of experiments upon plants and trees—roots, leaves, flowers fruits, trunk and boughs, germination, growth and decay.— The experiments record many of the wonderful phenomena of vegetation— I ought to derive great store of knowledge from these experiments, many of which form part of the history of my seedling trees— But I have lost much of my memory, especially, relating to philosophical enquiry, and the multitude of experiments disables for the intimate remembrance of any.— I fasten only upon the passages where he explains his own systems; as in closing his enquiries concerning plants. Experiment 676. he says— [“]We leave the description of plants, and their virtues to herbalists, and other like books of natural history; wherein men’s diligence hath been great, even to curiosity; for our experiments are only such, as do ever ascend a degree to the deriving of causes, and extracting of axioms, which we are not ignorant, but that some both of the ancient and modern writers have also laboured; but their causes and axioms are so full of imagination, and so infected with the old received theories, as they are mere inquisitions of experience, and concoct it not.” Now as to his investigation of causes, he explains all the arcana of vegetation, by a movement of Spirits; which he attributes to all vegetable as well as to all animal nature—and the properties of all trees and plants are under the dominion of Spirits, not less than Men and women— But what are these Spirits of plants Towards the close of the 7th. century, he starts off upon experiments on yawning—on the hiccough—sneezing—tenderness of teeth, the tongue, the taste, pestilential seasons—simples for medicines—and Venus.

But my wife was much indisposed all this day and confined to her chamber till towards Evening. Mrs John Adams still keeps her bed, and though yesterday, and the day before apparently recovering was again this day not so well— My own lameness of the right leg, continues without abatement of the sprain and without healing of the wounded part.— The restriction of exercise makes time hang heavy upon my hands, and suspends almost entirely the proposed address to my Constituents— Charles, and Walter Hellen got back from Boston last Evening about 11. O’Clock— The whig club meeting was at the Tremont Temple— Charles presided and Mr Choate delivered a speech of splendid eloquence against the annexation of Texas. Henry Hardwick was here again about that acre, and three quarters of land back of his house, which he has set his heart upon purchasing of me— He now offers me at the rate of forty dollars an acre for it, which he says is much more than it is worth— I told him I would go and see the place and give him an answer; but that to sell it for forty dollars an Acre, or for five times that amount was out of the question. He said that it would then not be worth while for me to go and look at it.— The heat this day was oppressive and languid. The diary occupied me till dinner— After which I resorted to the couch for half an hour, but without repose— I then attempted to read Macaulay’s Review of Lord Mahon’s History of the War of the succession in Spain, but soon found I was reading to no purpose— Taking no interest in what I read—dragging heavily along from page to page and dosing over them all.— So I rode out in the Barouche with Louisa C. Smith and Mrs Charles Adams— She alighted to pay a visit to Mrs Lunt—we drove by the new road through Copeland street to Braintree, and returning over Penn’s hill took up again Mrs Charles and came home by Willard Street, and the Railway quarries. The ride was pleasant, but the afternoon was gone, and I had not written a line upon my task— And so passes day after day— I had read in the morning the 8th. Century of Bacon’s Sylva Sylvarum— These experiments are miscellaneous— Dr Rawley in his preface says that he who reads them attentively will find in them a secret order— But he says also that Lord Bacon himself said he had collected them without methodical order, to induce other men to do the same— This century begins with an experiment touching veins of medicinal earth— The next upon the growth of sponges—then upon sea-fish put in fresh waters— Drinks in Turkey— Sweat—and the glow-worm follow in succession. Where is the secret order between these? The experiments in consort touching the impressions, which the passions of the mind make upon the body are deeply interesting; but Caterpillars, Cantharides, Lassitude; is it not ludicrous to grope for a secret order of succession upon topics such as these?

It occurs simultaneously with the real close of the dog days—that is with the first morning appearance of Sirius, after his conjunction with the Sun. I have not been able to ascertain this to a day by observation for want of a succession of clear mornings at the time of the transition; but I have no doubt it is between the 15th. and 20th. of August. There had been prospects of rain and threats of thunder gust, with the intense heat of the last two days— Last evening there was a light shower without thunder, and in the night a heavy gale, which continued after I rose this morning, and finally cleared off with a crystal Northwester and bracing cold. The third night poultice upon my wounded knee, not even cooled the inflammation around it. Dr Woodward who after several days of intermission, from inflammation of his eyes, came again to visit my wife and Mrs John Adams, looked at my knee, and advised the application of lead water which was accordingly done— And after dinner I rode with Miss Smith, Mrs Charles, her boy Arthur and Mary-Louisa, round by the lower landing and over Penn’s hill.— I read the ninth century of the Sylva Sylvarum, and the close of Macaulay’s Review of Lord Mahon’s History of the War of the Spanish succession— The Experiments of the 9th century are various, and some of them mystical— The first one touching perception in bodies insensible, tending to natural divination or subtile trials— And he begins with a startling assertion, that all bodies whatever, though they have no sense, yet they have perception: for when one body is applied to another, there is a kind of election to embrace that which is agreeable, and to exclude or expel that which is ingrate— It is therefore a subject of a very noble inquiry, to inquire of the more subtile perceptions; for it is another key to open nature, as well as the sense; and sometimes better— And besides, it is a principal means of natural divination; for that which in these perceptions appeareth early, in the great effects cometh long after— That perception is an attribute of all bodies whatsoer, is a postulate which I am not prepared to grant; nor is it necessary for the argument which recommends the study of Secret Sympathies, and of which there is in nature multitudes sufficient for the curiosity of the most inquisitive spies of Nature— Bacon however is constantly repeating the principles of his system. “To apply, says he notions philosophical to plebeian terms; or to say, where the notions cannot fitly be reconciled that there wanteth a term or nomenclature for it, as the antients used, they be but shifts of ignorance; for knowledge will be ever a wandering and indigested thing, if it be but a commixture of a few notions that are at hand and occur and not excited from a sufficient number of instances, and those well collated” The chief interest of the Review of the History of the War of the Spanish succession is in the adventures and character of Mordaunt the eccentric Earl of Peterborough. For as to the two rival competitors for the crown of Spain the only question seems to be which was the most insignificant of the two. "

Dr Woodward’s wash of lead water, promises to disperse the inflammation, and to heal the laceration of the skin below my knee; and although the tendon from the joint of the knee down to the sole of the foot is yet sore and the space between the outer ankle bone and the heel is almost black, I am getting daily an easier use of my limb. I answered a Letter, from Daniel P. King, declining his invitation to a political whig meeting at Lynn the 4th. of next Month— This afternoon there came as visitors, a Mr. Thayer, a son of my old acquaintance the late Solomon Thayer of Braintree, and with him, Mr and Mr Richardson, now Residents at St. Louis, Missouri, Mr and Mrs Bacon of Boston, with a daughter ten or twelve years old, and Mrs Jones, of whom I learnt only the name.— Charles and his wife went to Boston, taking their boy Arthur with them to consult Dr Bigelow, upon his case— But he thought Time and Patience would bring the remedy— Niles’s Register of the 17th. which came this day contains an Article of historical facts relative to the Florida Treaty of 1819. and a series of Articles under the head of Southern Convention, marking the movement of the Southern Disunionists to carry through the Texas annexation conspiracy.— Captain Tyler has at last issued an address to his friends withdrawing his name as a Candidate for election as President of the United States— They absorbed my attention and stimulated my industry, full three hours of this day— Shall it be in vain?— I read the tenth and last century of Bacon’s Sylva Sylvarum. He calls it a Natural History; but so is Hannah Glasse’s cookery book— There are one thousand experiments in consort or solitary of heterogeneous character, many of them exceedingly curious, but huddled together without commune vinculum to keep any thing upon the memory— The last century commences with experiments in concert touching the transmission and influx of immateriate virtues, and the force of imagination. This topic is inexhaustible— He says it is “such as we are a little doubtful to propound; it is so prodigious: but that it is so constantly avouched by many; and we have set it down as a law to ourselves to examine things to the bottom; and not to receive upon credit, or reject upon improbabilities, until there hath passed a due examination.”— 986— [“]I myself remember, that being in Paris, and my father dying in London, two or three days before my fathers death, I had a dream, which I told to divers English gentlemen; that my father’s house in the country was plaistered all over with black mortar.”— The last Experiment is solitary touching the general sympathy of men’s spirits— The delight which men have in popularity, fame, honour, submission, and subjection of other men’s minds, wills or affections, although these things may be desired for other ends, seemeth to be a thing in itself, without contemplation of consequence, grateful and agreeable to the nature of man &c. quod vide— Then I returned cursorily to Macaulay’s review of Lord Mahon’s history of the War of the Spanish succession—that War which made Europe an Aceldama for twelve years to settle whether Charles of Austria, or Philip of Anjou should be the Roi fainéant of Spain.

A gentle rain began last evening, and continued through the Night— This day was cloudy—chilling cold closing with thunder, lightening and a heavy shower, without clearing up.— I received yesterday a copy of J. Middleton’s Celestial Atlas with the small volume its companion—a present from the author in England. The work with which judge John Davis had made me acquainted last Summer, and of which I then expressed to him my approbation— Mr James Savage had on his last visit to England become acquainted with the author, and through his means a correspondence had been opened between Mr Middleton and judge Davis.— The judge communicated to Mr Middleton my favourable opinion of his work, and this present is forwarded to me by the hands of Mr Savage— This day I was by the condition of the weather confined almost entirely to the house, and towards Evening Mrs Treadway, with her Son in Law and daughter Mr and Mrs Crane, and their infant Son, came in from Richmond, Virginia, New-York and Boston— Charles and his wife passed the Evening with us— I read this morning, the New Atlantis of Lord Bacon— Like the Sylva Sylvarum, a posthumous publication, by Doctor William Rawley; said by him to be a work unfinished— It is in form, a fable somewhat like Swift’s Captain Gulliver, the narrative of an Island, discovered on a voyage from Peru, to China, and Japan— Rawley says it was devised to exhibit a model or description of a College instituted for the interpreting of nature, and the producing of great and marvellous works, for the benefit of men; under the name of Solomon’s house; or the College of the six days work— He says too that Bacon first intended to have included in this frame a code of laws, or of the best state or mould of a Commonwealth— But this was never performed; foreseeing it would be a long work, his desire of collecting the Natural history diverted him, which he preferred many degrees before it— The New Atlantis in regard to its near affinity with the Natural History is printed immediately after it— The Solomon’s house is a college for the collection of experiments in Natural History— A stone house for the ten centuries— The governor of the island tells the traveller that about 3000 years before, they had ships that “went sundry voyages, as well to your Straits, which you call the pillars of Hercules, as to other parts in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Seas; as to Peguin, which is the same with Cambaline, and Quinzy, upon the Oriental seas, as far as to the borders of the east Tartary.”— Where did he get that Quinzy?— I still read without yet finishing Macaulay’s review of Horace Walpole’s Letters to Sir Horace Mann— Macaulay cuts him up without mercy—but he is more exorable to the memory of his father; Sir Robert— Horace’s writings have amused me so much, and are so full of genius that I had not analyzed his character with such a steel pen as Macaulay’s. I wrote a page of task—but was obliged to set up till half past eleven to finish it— My subject spreads till I lose sight of its central point. "

A dull, cold, cloudy day, without rain, most busily occupied, with no other efficient action than a walk before dinner; with Mr Crane up the hill of Charles’s house Charles himself was gone to Boston, but returned home to dine— We saw his wife, and Mr Crane admired the prospect of the harbour—the islands, the city, the village, and the western hills. My garden and Nursery rambles are barren and my meditations teeming but as yet unfruitful— I cannot do the writing and the reading of my daily task in one day—one of them is and must be sacrificed to the other I read this morning Mr Bacon in praise of knowledge, and began his Valerius Terminus or the Interpretation of Nature; with the Annotations of Hermes Stella— A few fragments of the first book— And then there is a Note, that none of the annotations of Stella are set down in these fragments— Of all this title there is no explanation— Valerius Terminus and Hermes Stella with annotations, not set down must explain themselves— I see nothing but fragments of the first book of an immense imaginary work upon the interpretation of Nature—extremely curious—but profoundly to be studied—22 quarto pages. I intended to have them for this mornings portion, but before I had got half through came the daily mail and newspapers; and in the Boston Courier of this Morning the address of John Tyler to his friends throughout the Union, withdrawing his name from the canvas, as a candidate for election of President— To this step he has been driven, by a deputation of Democrats from New York; disclosing to him that cannot get up an electoral ticket; to vote for him in any one State in the Union— His address is a Captain Bobadil brag of the prosperity of the Country all the merit of which he claims as due to his administration, and a viperous string of invective against Henry Clay, Chancellor Kent, Thomas H. Benton and me— The dirtiest of his spite is vented upon me. He is perhaps too low for further notice from me, but as the tool of others hate his address is not to be overlooked or despised— I have come in my own address to my constituents to the point of my own vindication, and the exposure of the base Jackson and Erving plot against me, which it will require all my energy and more than all my discretion to manage— A falser and fouler conspiracy never debased the character of man than this— To show it in all its turpitude to the world is my duty to the world and to my self— I have the power and the means—the transcendent difficulty is to do it with calmness and composure, and without an unbecoming manifestation of temper— Medio tutissimus ibis— Not the tameness of a nameless victim, not the tempest that loses self command. Oh! for a curb upon my temper!— I am still also labouring through, Macaulays characteristics of Horace Walpole, and his father— Charles and his wife, and Mr Beale spent the evening with us "

Sunday  Dr Frothingham preached this morning from Matthew 25.18. “But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his Lord’s money”— The Dr. observed that every part of this parable of the Talents was rich with instruction, and every word in which it is related, subject for grave and varied meditation— The commendation of the Servants to whom the lord had entrusted severally the 5 and the two talents was susceptible of improvements impressing the duties of diligence and fidelity; but it was worthy of enquiry what was the precise nature of the wickedness of him, who digged in the earth and hid his Lord’s money— It was not dishonesty, not selfish avarice, no embezzlement—no conversion of the money to his own use— It was not careless, extravagant, or foolish investment of the money, exposing it to be lost. He returned it to the Lord, as he had received it from him, without diminution without increase— But his duty was to improve the fund entrusted to his care— He was not the faithless, but the unprofitable servant. That was his wickedness, and for that his punishment was just as it was severe. His inaction had been caused by a sullen, discontented, disrespectful temper. The reason that he assigned for his neglect of duty was offensive to his Lord— He said he knew him to be a hard man, reaping where he had not sown, and gathering where he had not strewed— The very considerations which should have spur’d him on to the most active exertions to turn his talent to account— In the corresponding narrative by Luke of the same parable, 19.20. The servant says he had laid up the talent in a Napkin— There is indeed so much in the narrative between the two Evangelists that it might reasonably be questioned whether they are one and the same story. Dr Frothingham’s discourse was copious in thought, and forcible in application— He walked home with me, and dined with us. We rode to meeting in the afternoon in a flood rather than a shower of rain— The auditory was very small—about 40 persons, of whom perhaps ten women— The afternoon discourse was from 2. Corinthians 12.7. “And lest I should be exalted above measure, through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.” The words underscored were the text, and there was no comment on the repetition of the assignment of the purpose for which this mysterious and unexplained thorn in the flesh was given— The Doctor’s eldest son Thomas came out with him, and with Walter Hellen dined with Mrs Charles on the hill, while Charles himself dined with us. The Doctor returned to Boston, and Charles and his wife spent the evening with us. "

I saw the Sunrise, and filled an earthen pot to sow in it apple and pear-seeds— I mixed manure with earth from the richest mould of the garden for my experiments— But this time lost me the day for my task— Mr Waterston the father of the clergyman; and a young congregational minister, a native of this State, settled at Louisville, Kentucky called and spent about two hours with me in conversation— Mr Hayward on leaving me requested an autograph, for Miss Eliza Speed, a young Lady of Louisville, which I gave him— My Son brought me a Letter from Mr John G.

That universities incline wits to sophistry and affectation; cloisters to fables and unprofitable subtilty; study at large to variety; and that it is hard to say, whether mixture of contemplations with an active life, or retiring wholly to contemplations, do disable and hinder the mind more.”— Not a word read of Macaulay.

No sight of morning stars, or of rising or setting Sun.— My Son went to Boston, and returned to dine Mr Withington is a young student of divinity recently from the theological school at Cambridge— A native of Dorchester and now residing there— He assigned two motives for his call to see me—one, as a manifestation of personal respect for my character— The other to ask my opinions upon some scruples which troubled him with regard to his voting at the presidential election— He was an abolitionist in principle, though not of the abolition party; nor of any abolition Society. He was also a whig and strongly desirous of voting for the whig candidate— But the Liberty party charged him with being an avowed duelist—and not only a Slave holder, but a decided partizan for perpetual Slavery— A gambler—intemperate, and otherwise of loose licentious life— There was no satisfactory refutation of these charges made public, and he was much perplexed what to do. He needed advice and came to ask it of me— I said that his doubts were of no easy solution. That I took no part as a partizan in the presidential election I deemed it my duty to abstain from canvassing for any one for that office, and to leave it to the people to fix their choice for themselves.— But as to matters of fact I would say what I knew or believed and as to principles, what I think— Mr Clay is a Slave holder and a supporter of Slavery— I believe him in error upon those points; and hope he will revise and reform his opinions. He is a man of the world—of self-indulgent habits; but not as I believe a gambler or intemperate— He abhors dueling, and has been engaged in several duels— A rigorous puritanical principle of morals cannot be applied to the exercise of the right of suffrage— There must be some reference to the result— Mr Clay’s chief competitor is vastly more exceptionable than he— To vote for a third candidate who cannot be elected is in effect to vote for the worst of the three— Mr Withington thanked me. My reasoning evidently failed to convince him— Mr Crane and Walter Hellen returned from their excursion to Lowell, and we took tea, and spent the Evening at Charles’s house— Except my wife who is much indisposed— Mary, who is yet confined to her chamber, and Walter Hellen, who came from Lowell with a cold and head ache.— I read of Bacon the Filum Labyrinthi, sive formula inquisitionis ad Filios— Pars Prima—but there is no second part. It begins— Francis Bacon thought in this manner— Loose thoughts— Objections to the prevailing systems and modes of teaching— Next to these Sequela chartarum sive Inquisitio Legitima de Calore et frigore— Sectio Ordinis. Charta suggestionis, sive memoria fixa.— Experiments upon heat and cold— Then follow Physiological remains— Inquisitions touching the compounding of metals. These are short separate tracts, the Latin titles of which are fantastical and unintelligible— Small issues of gigantic projects. "

Oration by Revd George Putnam and Poem— On full deliberation and special consideration of my lameness I concluded not to go, on either of the days.— I had special invitations this day from Dr John Codman of Dorchester and Dr George Parkman of Boston to the rooms of their Sons, who were graduated this day. Dr Francis Parkman of Boston, and Mr Leverett Saltonstall of Salem have also sons graduates of this day.— Charles and Mr Crane returned this afternoon before sunset— Harvey Field came this afternoon, and after much chaffering agreed to give 3000 dollars for the Quincy meadow, 6 Acres of the Penn’s valley farm— He proposed also to sell to me his own house and farm, and also to clear out the brook behind the native spot houses; concerning all which I propose to take further advice— Mr Davis an Architect was here this evening with plans for an enlargement of Charles’s house, and for appending to it a fire proof building for the preservation and safe keeping of my father’s and my own manuscript books and papers— I have long been deeply anxious upon this subject— The library and the manuscripts are all now in houses liable every day of the year and every hour of the day to be consumed by fire. My career must very shortly close; and I look with intense feeling to posterity for the preservation of my father’s name, and of my own as his son. All my hopes are centered in my surving son and his infant children—daughters may possibly transmit inheritances, but not names— My son will not dishonour his, but how frail and precarious is the tenure of a single life! what a lottery the chances of virtue, wisdom and prosperity even of one among four small children! I feel the necessity of guarding against casualties from external causes, from the decays of nature and accidents of fire. For the rest in humble reverence and hope I rely upon mercy from on high— I read this morning, Articles of Questions touching Minerals— The Lord Bacon’s questions with Dr Meverel’s solutions— Then the Lord Verulams Inquisition concerning the versions, transmutations multiplications and effections of bodies— After which, a Speech touching the recovering of drowned mineral works— Certain experiments about weight in air and water— Sudden thoughts under the title of Experiments for Profit—and experiments upon simple and compound liquors—and about attractive and repulsive bodies— My task languishes in the search for documents of the 15th. Congress 2d. Session. "

Fearing of New-York, now a visitor at Mr Lunt’s, with a request that I would put some thing in it; and it must be done immediately, for the young Lady was going for New-York this afternoon. I could not mortify my granddaughter by a refusal and wrote a short Stanza. I keep copies of all these Album Fadaises; but am ashamed to meet four out of five of them— These offscourings of the wits of distinguished persons are almost universally dull. But it is better to be dull than churlish.— Of Lord Bacon the physiological remains which I read yesterday are followed by the medical remains—a sort of apothicary’s shop; a catalogue of astringents, openers and cordials instrumental to health— An extract for his own use out of the book of the prolongation of life; and recipes of his own— 32 empirical nostrums of pills, potions, clysters and quackeries Among which 14. Never to keep the body in the same posture above half an hour at a time 15 Four precepts. To break off custom. To shake off spirits ill disposed. To meditate on youth. To do nothing against a man’s genius. 26. Heroic desires— 28 To provide always an apt breakfast.— The series closes with medical receipts for the gout and the stone— And then come the Works Moral— Beginning with a fragment of the Colours of Good and Evil. To the Lord Mountjoye— In the dedication he says, he takes his subject from the last part of the best book of Aristotle, who he says does not deliver, and unwrap himself well of that he seemeth to conceive; nor to be a master of his own knowledge— There are ten colours, or appearances of Good and Evil— Extracts from Aristotle—but given in Latin; and of which he presents his analysis of persuasives and dissuasives—detecting the fallacies of the Stagirite— For my task I had a long search for documents of the second Session of the 15th. Congress of which I have two sets and could find neither of them complete, and miss especially the report of the select Committee of the House of Representatives on General Jackson’s Seminole War Campaign. In searching however for these, I found some others which I wanted, but did not know where to look for them— As Niles’s Register for 1819 and Onis’s pamphlet in a volume of the Casket.— The casual and unforeseen interruptions to my labours are teazing and many. This evening I was taken away, to go and take tea with our Ladies, at Mrs T. B. Adams’s. My wife can go nowhere and Mrs John Adams is still confined to her chamber— Mrs Foster and Elizabeth C. Adams have just returned from their excursion to Quebec and the Falls. Mr and Mrs G. T. Bigelow and Charles Miller were at Mrs T. B. Adams’s. "

While I was gone to Boston yesterday Mr Harrison Gray Otis came out to pay me a visit with his Son in Law, Andrew Ritchie— And last evening two young Ladies, Miss Bartlett and Miss Wood invited me to a Pic-Nic where the Ladies of Quincy are to meet in a grove behind Mrs T. B. Adams’s house, next Thursday at 3. O’Clock P.M. and said the Ladies would be glad if I would speak to them— I said if my health would permit I would come, and if the spirit should move would speak a few words— Our late evening visitors, were Elizabeth C. Adams, Mrs George T. Bigelow, and Charles Miller— This morning I gave again the two morning hours till Sunrise to exercise and work sub Jove— My son and Walter Hellen started upon a week’s excursion to Wood’s hole, and perhaps to Nantucket. Mr Crane was to have gone with them, but on his tour to Lowell took a fit of Asthma, which became so severe that last Night leeches were applied to his breast, and he was this day confined to the house.— I had no visitors, and excepting the time consumed by the Siesta, now become a necessary of life, and the time lost in the search and consultation of documents I was able to write rather more than my daily page. But my progress is Snail paced— I have come in the reading of Bacon, to the Essays—Civil and Moral, which having read more than once, I shall now pass over. There are three dedications of this book. 1. to his brother Anthony Bacon 30 January 1597. 2. To his loving brother Sir John Constable Kt. and 1612. 3. to Villiers, duke of Buckingham, the worthless favourite of James and Charles. 1625— The last signed Fran. St. Alban— It was the last year of his life He died 9 April 1626. In the second dedication he says the former edition had been often printed—and in the third he says that of all his other works his Essays have been most current— They have been so ever since— Numberless editions of them have been published— So that it is no vain boasting when he says, I do conceive, that the Latin volume of them, being in the universal language, may last as long as books last. But I suppose that in these days, the English original finds many more readers than the Latin translation— The Essays are followed by a Collection of Apophthegms, New and old 150 of which I read this day. In his preface to them he refers to the example of Julius Caesar, and says its pity that book is lost— If they are not better than Bacon’s they are no great loss.— He says they are mu crones verborum pointed speeches. He says he will not omit any because they are vulgar; for many vulgar ones are excellent good—that may be—but some of his are beastly filthy, and ought never to have been published— The practice of collecting apophthegms is perhaps good, but these are upon the whole flat and unprofitable.

It continued showery through the day— Mr Lunt preached in the morning from Matthew 22.37. “Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” He observed that the Saviour emphatically declared this to be the first and great Commandment— But cavilling speculators had sometimes enquired what was the reason for this precept—a question not easy to answer upon any principle founded on human reason— The command is for sentiment and not for action— Can we love by command?— what is the use of love without action? why should we love God? We can do him no service— We can contribute nothing to his glory or his power. He created us, for his own pleasure and not for ours— He continues our existence at his pleasure—not for ours— There is a reason assigned in 1 John 4.19. We love him, because he first loved us—all sufficient— The proof of his first love was in our creation— The proof of our love is in obedience to his commandments, and in the love of our brother— And it is only obedience to the second commandment, Love thy neighbour as thyself that we can prove our love to God— Mr Lunt suggested another proof by abstaining from the idle and licentious use of his name, and especially by refraining from the practice of profane swearing against which he urged a most earnest expostulation. He told a story of some political orator from the South afterwards notorious as a duelist, who haranguing at a public meeting in Boston, disgusted his audience by such frequent use of the name of God that at last one of his hearers called out to him dont swear so.— which mortified him and put him in check for the time— It is said that Mr Lunt’s rebuke to profane swearers was seasonable, and much needed at this time and place— His afternoon Sermon was from Luke 12.15. last clause of the verse—[“]for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things he possesseth.”— And Romans 8.6. also the last clause of the verse “to be spiritually minded is life and Peace.” whereupon he remarked that the passage from Luke declared what life is not, and the passage from the epistle to the Romans what it is— Not wealth—but the spiritual mind. Mrs T. B. Adams, Mrs John Angier and Mr Davis the Architect were here this afternoon, after church— Mrs Angier and Mr Davis had come from Medford this morning, and returned there this Evening.— The Steamer Hibernia, Captain Ryrie, arrived from Liverpool at Boston this afternoon, by a passage of 13 days and 2. hours—said to be the shortest ever made— Sidney Brooks, with his wife, and her Sister Miss Dehon came in her as passengers—of whom there are 98— Queen Victoria, has a second Son, born the 6th. of August.— "

                "text": "2. IV. Monday.  Mrs Treadway intended to have gone with Elizabeth C. Adams this morning to Medford; but found herself unwell and the sky was lowering. So Elizabeth went without her— I went up the hill for the second volume of Gales and Seaton’s State Papers, for the negotiation of Mr Monroe and Charles Pinckney with the Spanish Government in 1804–5. and while there was called down to see two whig visitors from the State of Alabama, Mr Freeman and Mr Johnson— Their visit was of mere curiosity, and Johnson who is a young man said that if he had returned home without seeing me, his father would not have forgiven him. Soon after dinner Mrs Patten Hall and Mrs Boardman came out to visit Mrs Treadway and Mrs Crane— They were followed by Mr Loring of Hingham, who came to invite me to the annual fishing party at Cohasset. We agreed upon to morrow week, the 10th. if the weather be fair—and if not, the 11th. or 12th. the party to be small.— Mr Loring was barely gone, when Mrs President Quincy with her daughter Abigail, and the two Misses Ruthven, Ladies from Scotland came upon a short visit; and then Mrs Charles, with her daughter Louisa-Catherine, and her sons John Quincy, Charles Francis and Henry Brooks took tea and passed the evening here— I read the remainder of Lord Bacon’s Apophthegms, with two shorter supplementary collections— Then come the Ornamenta Rationalia or Elegant sentences— Some made, others collected by the Lord Bacon, and by him put under the above said title. These are 36. proverbial aphorisms, in Latin, with English translations— They are followed by a Collection of Sentences out of some of the writings of the Lord Bacon, chiefly I think from the Essays— These are much better than the apophthegms and if at the age when I first read Bacon’s Essays—the life of Agricola, and the Annals and Histories of Tacitus— I had closely studied and mastered the power and beauty of a sententious Style and applied myself to the problem of embracing the maximum of thought in the minimum of words— I might have effected something in the world. It is now too late for me to begin— I read also the correspondence of Messrs. Monroe and C. Pinckney, with the Spanish Minister Cevallos, in 1805— The whole claim of French title west of the Mississippi rests upon La Salle’s fort built after the loss of his vessels in 1685. and exterminated within two years after— I read also some pages of William Darby’s Geographical description of the State of Louisiana &c. 2d Edition 1817.— His account of the rivers and Bays on the gulf of Mexico, is confused and self-contradictory.

The morning was cloudy, and the sky was all day clearing off— I took my two hours of exercise immediately after rising and planted button pear seeds and horse plum stones, in a flour pot. Six of my seedling Apple trees in the Nursery bear very fine Apples, and the one near the Summer house cellar is loaded with the wood house apple— The same with that from the parent tree— So that I consider that experiment wholly settled— But will the budded or grafted fruit produce fertile, or all barren seeds?— Mrs Charles F. Adams went to Boston to see her brother Sidney Brooks and his wife and Miss Dehon her Sister, just arrived in the Steamer Hibernia, from Liverpool— Mrs Treadway went also to pay a visit of two or three days to Mrs John Angier at Medford— Mr and Mrs Crane, and Mary Louisa, went also with Mrs Charles to Boston, and they all returned to dine.— A book pedlar by the name of John M’Gowan came to circulate a small pamphlet Family Doctor, with an appendix containing 100 valuable recipes—price 12 1/2 cents— As a supplement to Bacon’s apophthegms and elegant sentences, I took one of them— The first volume of Bacon closes with a half page of Notes for civil conversation, and an Essay on Death, which he finds the least of all evils, and yet he does not profess to be a stoic, and consider it as no evil— Having read through this volume, except the Essays, read before I skip’d over the second volume, for the present, wishing to come to the history of the reign of King Henry the 7th. which I have never read— It is dedicated to Prince Charles, afterwards Charles the first— The adulation is not quite so fulsome as I had expected— The History begins abruptly, with the sequel to the battle of Bosworth Field— I read of this very few pages, and find myself much interested in the history— I was also much occupied in reviewing the negotiations between the United States and Spain from the conclusion of the Louisiana to that of the Florida Treaty.— The most material points I have found; but there is much yet to trace. I answered a Letter of enquiry from George H. Child at Boston, as to time of sailing of the Boston frigate for France, upon my father’s first mission there— 15. February 1778— And I received from David Lee Child, with an enclosure of Thomas Earle’s Resolutions and the report of the American Anti-Slavery Society’s Committee against me.— We spent the evening in examining Middleton’s celestial Atlas with the companion, comparing them with the Stars in the firmament, which we observed with a sky of transcendent clearness and an atmosphere soft and mild as Paradise. We saw the signs of the Zodiac from the scorpion setting to Aries rising the Great and Little Bear, Cassiopeia, Arcturus in Bootes; the Gem of the Northern Crown—Perseus with the head of Medusa, Andromeda, the square of Pegasus-Vega and the mirror stars of Lyra the Swan in the Milky way and many others.

Mr Harvey Field came in great impatience for the deed of the Quincy meadow, six acres, for which he said my Son had agreed to the execution and delivery this day. He brought with him his eldest son, eight years old, and who bears my name, and said he wanted the deed, this day, having agreed to give one for a house lot on the land, for 600 dollars— He brought also three bills of one thousand dollars each of the New-England Bank, which he said he had received this morning, from Ibrahim Bartlet, Cashier of the Quincy Stone Bank. I hunted up an old blank fee-simple warranty deed, filled it up, signed and sealed it— Mr Field went out and found Mr George W. Beale at work on his farm, and brought him in, and he took as Justice of Peace my acknowledgment and that of my wife for her relinquishment of Dower— The witnesses were Louisa C. Smith and Susan Crane— And thus I alienated the Quincy meadow, purchased by my father of Coll. Josiah Quincy in 1772 and conveyed by my father to me in 1803. I parted with it reluctantly—perhaps improvidently, but at what is esteemed here a very high price.— Field told me that a woodlot of 15 Acres on Pine hill, between two of mine was sold yesterday at auction, and purchased by Daniel Baxter, and two others— But there was some difficulty between them about the payment, and they were all willing that it should be conveyed to me for 33 dollars an acre— I told him I would take it at that rate— Having now 3000 dollars upon my hands I determined to invest it as soon as possible, and for that purpose to go to Boston to-morrow— I called at the Stone Bank, and deposited there the three Bills, which Mr Bartlett received and entered to my credit as cash. I drew at the same time by a check 200 dollars in bills, for my current household expenses, and desired Mr Bartlett to give my compliments to his daughter, and say to her that an engagement of business at Boston to morrow would deprive me of the pleasure of attending at the Pic-Nic, as I had promised— I put into the Post-Office a copy of my Eulogy upon James Madison, which I had promised to George Bancroft— French the Postmaster, took me mysteriously into another room, to shew me a pair of spectacles which he said had belonged to Governor Hancock—and which Mrs Sarah Morton had given him, on account of his keeping the Hancock house— At Gill’s shop I took a supply of five sheets of blank warranty Deeds. While we were at dinner Mrs Charles sent me an invitation to come up the hill and see a ship come into the harbor.— I went up with Mr Crane, and we saw three large ships go up— I spent the afternoon, till near Sunset in conversation with Mrs Charles, and enjoying the prospect— And the evening in star-gazing and consulting Middleton’s celestial Atlas with the companion.

Mr Daniel Baxter came this morning and repeated the offer which Mr Harvey Field had yesterday made to me in his name of the Pine hill 15 acre lot at 33 dollars an acre. I agreed to take it, but then found there was some difficulty which he did not explain, about his right to convey the land. He said he had another woodlot of 49. acres which he was willing to sell for 30 dollars an acre, with a growth of 20 years wood upon it— I promised at some leisure time to go and look at the land. I went into Boston with Louisa C. Smith whom I left at Mr James H. Foster’s and then called at Dr. Frothingham’s— He was out and I told Mrs. Frothingham that I would come and dine with them at 2— I strolled round the corner of Federal and Milk Streets, and seeing at the Corinthian Hall an advertisement of the exhibition of Alston’s picture of Belshazzar’s feast, I went in and inspected that work which reminded me of the risum teneatis amici—for it is as if the artist had purposely intended to realize the imaginary absurd picture of Horace’s art of poetry. It is the most chaotic composition upon canvas that I ever beheld— There are two small designs, first thoughts, shewing what the large picture was intended to be. Both these have great merit, and one of them is far better than the final abortion. In neither of them were the finger of the hand on the wall, nor the words written by them painted.— There is a group of Babylonian soothsayers and astrologers of gigantic dimensions, double the size of the king, queen, and Daniel—and they are double the size of figures at the banquet table behind. I met there Sophia Quincy who was as much displeased with the picture as I was, and regretted that Mr Alston’s friends had allowed it to be exhibited— From this Hall I went into State Street and walked to the head of long wharf, where I saw the unfinished Custom-house with its multitude of granite pillars— Returning slowly up the Street, I met P. P. F. Degrand, the person of whom I was in search, and requested him to procure for me 30 shares of the stock of the great western rail-road, and to bring them to my Son’s office, which he did in the course of half an hour— I gave him a check for 2692.50 upon the Quincy Stone Bank; which in consideration of my name they consented to take at the Suffolk Bank, and I received the certificate for 30 shares of the Stock— Mr Palfrey the Secretary of the Commonwealth came in to enquire of my son to enquire if he could recommend as an agent for the protection of coloured free citizens of Massachusetts—in the Southern States— I called at the houses of Robert C. Winthrop, judge John and Isaac P. Davis; neither of them at home. Dined at Dr. Frothingham’s. At Mr James H. Foster at 5. Waited an hour for James. Home with Louisa C.

But Fahrenheit was at 40. and the morning before breakfast too cold for writing; the consequence of which was that I merely retrieved the loss of nearly a day in this diary, and that my task slumbers. I answered a Letter from Mr Frye, enclosing one from Joseph Pilling offering me 5000 dollars for my house in Pennsylvania avenue at Washington— I am not willing to sell it for less than 6000, and so express to Mr Frye— My wife was yet confined the whole of this day to her chamber and Mary rode out yesterday the first time since her illness. I barely looked into the volume of the Library of useful knowledge containing an account of Lord Bacon’s Novum organum scientiarum or new method of studying the Sciences in two parts—said to have been written by Lord Brougham—but I made progress in the history of the reign of Henry the 7th.— I find this reading very agreeable, and am quite delighted with the Style; which must be considerably modified, at least for the spelling.— In the very first page he says of Richard the 3d that he was “a Prince in military virtue approved, jealous of the honour of the English Nation, and likewise a good lawmaker for the ease and solace of the common people.”— There are numerous examples of pregnant antithesis and synonimous nest eggs, and curious similitudes— The people made heartier demonstrations of joy on the day of his marriage with the white rose, Elizabeth of York, than on the day of his entry, or of his coronation “which the king rather noted than liked.”— “that it was not the first blow that made the war invasive, for that no wise Prince would stay for, but the first provocation, or at least the first preparation.”— “Pretext is never wanting to power.”— “Arguments are ever with multitudes too weak for suspicions.” “This Court (Star chamber) is one of the sagest, and noblest institutions of this kingdom.” In Yorkshire [“]the memory of King Richard was so strong that it lay like lees in the bottom of men’s hearts; and if the vessel was but stirred, it would come up.”— [“]In my judgment it is some defect even in the best writers of history, that they do not often enough summarily deliver and set down the most memorable laws that passed in the times whereof they writ, being indeed the principal acts of peace.—” The book is full of such striking passages, but I have no time or space to record them.— This afternoon I walked to Mrs T. B. Adams’s and delivered to her a Letter from her Son, Isaac Hull, engaged on the survey of the North-eastern boundary.— She spoke of the Pic-Nic yesterday as having been very numerous. The universalist minister, Mr Davis, speechified. Returning home I stop’d and spent an hour with Mr Charles— He himself and Walter Hellen returned this evening from their excursion to Woods’s hole and Nantucket "

Sowed a row of Button pear seeds from the tree next the dwarf apple, immediately behind the tool shed in the garden—grass mowed in the front yard and seminary.— Mrs Treadway returned before dinner from her visit to Medford and Boston— In the Stage with her came a young man named Noble Butler, of Louisville Kentucky, a student of divinity at the theological school at Cambridge; who came merely to see me, and to ask of me an autograph to send to his wife. I invited him to dine with us; but he was engaged to take the return Stage to Boston at half past two, and declined. After dinner, Mr James M. Shute, a Stereotype plate maker came from Boston with Letters from Jonathan Elliot, and B. B. French, the chief Sub-clerk in the office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives of the United States. Elliot proposes to purchase the plates for a Stereotype Edition of his Debates in the State conventions, on the Constitution of the United States, in five volumes. And orders 200 copies to be struck off, to be delivered to members of Congress on or before the first of March next at 15 dollars a set—a third edition; the preceding editions having been in four volumes. On receiving these proposals Mr Shute applied to Robert C. Winthrop, to enquire of Elliot’s credit and Mr Winthrop referred him to B. B. French whose answer Mr Shute read to me. French refers to a Resolution of H.R.U.S. adopted on the 14th. of June last, involving, he says, an expense of one hundred thousand dollars; directing the Clerk of the House to furnish the members of the 28th. Congress, each a set of the documents already furnished to the members of the 26th. and 27th. Congresses, which French says includes Elliot’s debates—but no appropriation was made to pay for the books, and a proviso is contained in the Resolution that it shall not authorise a reprint of the books— I recurred to the Journal of the House which I have in sheets, and found the Resolution which was offered by R. C. Winthrop, and carried through by the previous question twice over against the opposition of Cave Johnson, by yeas and nays, first to lay on the table 64 to 111. and last to reconsider the vote for the Resolution 67 to 105— French says the Clerk (M’Nulty) refuses to execute the Resolution, and I advised Mr Shute that as the reprint and the order for 200 copies for the members are directly in the face of the Resolution, he should have nothing to do with it— And as the Resolution was offered and carried by Mr Winthrop, I recommended a second visit to him: that he should tell him my opinions on the subject, and conclude for his conduct, upon Winthrop’s final advice— I received from President Quincy the work of Joutel in French and English from the University library—from George Bancroft a flattering Letter, and from W. J. Taylor and John H. Pleasants—Richmond a strange one. "

                "text": "8. IV.15. Sunday.  Sun rose 5.32. Set. 6:25  Mr Stetson the Minister of the old congregational church at Medford preached for Mr Lunt this morning from Galatians 6.5. “For every man shall bear his own burden” This epistle to the Galatians is a controversial argument against the practice of circumcision, and generally to set aside the ritual obligations of the Law—meaning the Levitical Law— Jesus had not explicitly abrogated that Law— But he had commanded his apostles to preach his gospel to all Nations, baptising them in the name of the father and of the son, and of the holy ghost, and had promised to be with them till the end of the world— Baptism was thus tacitly but not explicitly substituted for circumcision. The converted Jews however still adhered to that bloody rite— From the narrative in the Acts it appears that at first both Peter and Paul preached the gospel indiscriminately to the Jews and Gentiles— Peter was by a miraculous vision was absolved from the Law as to lawful and unlawful meats; but he still adhered to circumcision. It was at Corinth that Paul after his return and that of Silas and Timothy from Macedonia, reasoning in the synagogue to Jews and Greeks, when the Jews opposed themselves and blasphemed—shook his raiment and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads: I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles—and the same night in a vision he was recommissioned, with a promise from the Lord that he would be with him, and no man should set on him to hurt him (Acts 18.5–10) In this Epistle to the Galatians 2.7. he says “the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter”—and they quarreled—and Paul says he withstood Peter to the face, because he was to be blamed— And this axiom that every man shall bear his own burden is part of Paul’s argument. Mr Stetson and his son dined with us, and his afternoon text was from Matthew 16.24 “Let him deny himself.” The whole verse being “Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.” The discourse was upon self denial, which he defined somewhat metaphysically, observing that self-denial implied a double nature in man one craving and the other refusing the same thing. He descanted also largely upon the soul—its immortality, its solitude, its condition in futurity— I read also a Sermon of Orville Dewey upon Retribution, recommended to me by Mrs Charles— After the service this afternoon I went with Louisa C. Smith, Mrs Treadway, and Mrs Charles, and visited Mrs Josiah Quincy, her daughter Abigail, and the two Misses Ruthven. Mrs Waterston was confined by illness to her chamber and could not see us. Mrs Quincy had given me a note from her husband this morning inviting me to pass two or three days with them at Cambridge this week or the next, and I promised to go, a week from next Wednesday. "

                "text": "9. III 40. Monday.  Sun rose 5.33— Set 6:23.  Charles’s youngest Son, Arthur has been for some weeks in drooping health, but I met him Saturday towards evening, on the hill, with his nurse Rebecca—yesterday afternoon the scarlet fever struck out upon him, to our great alarm, though with favourable symptoms.— This morning early, Charles took his eldest son, John Quincy to Boston, to place him at the town Latin School. Mr Crane, and Walter Hellen, went also to Boston intending to visit Medford and mount Auburn, but found time only for a pilgrimage to the Bunker hill Monument at Charlestown. To the top of this they ascended with the help of a steam engine. Walter Hellen returned alone about 8 O’Clock this evening; but Charles and Mr Crane stayed to attend a Meeting of the young men’s whig club, and got back shortly before midnight— Mr Daniel Baxter came with his Deed ready drawn of the 15 Acre woodlot on Pine hill, interlocked between two lots of mine but he was not fully provided with his title— In 1829. it was purchased by Lemuel Bracket, and in November of that year was surveyed by Lemuel Humphrey for him. in 1832. it was after cutting off all the wood upon it, sold by Bracket to Caleb and Livingston White and in 1837. Caleb conveyed his part to Livingston White—who now conveys to Daniel Baxter. But he had with him only the deed from Bracket to the Whites and the bounds in his deed to me were not properly described. So I told him he must produce all the evidences of his title, and amend the description of the bounds, which he undertook to do— After dinner a person whom I took to be a clergyman came with a friend of his, named Elisha Hale settled in one of the North-western States—his own named is Cozzens—but I find not this name in the list of Clergymen of Boston in the Massachusetts Register— They came merely on a visit of curiosity, and stayed but a few minutes— I finished reading Lord Bacon’s History of the Reign of Henry the 7th. which has been a delicious treat. There is an imitation of the style of Tacitus in the narrative, and an interweaving of moral reflection with the series of events, extremely pleasant.— The story of Peter Osbeck son of a converted Jew of Tournay, historically known by the name of Perkin Warbeck is marvellous. “Nay, himself, with long and continual counterfeiting, and with often telling a lye, was turned by habit almost into the thing he seemed to be; and from a liar to a believer.”— The notice of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, and the expedition of Sebastian Cabot, or as Bacon calls him Gaboto, are among the remarkable passages in this work— Another is the melancholy fortunes and fate of Edward Earl of Warwick, son of Edward the 4th. brother Clarence— The character of Henry himself at the close of the book is drawn with a master’s hand, but with a Courtier’s spirit, smoothing over the truth with flattery.

Charles, anxious for his Son Arthur, and Mr Crane afflicted with a fit of asthma, returned immediately to Quincy and sent back Benjamin with the barouche for Walter Hellen and me.

                "text": "11. IV. Wednesday.  My morning exercise is now confined to sowing seeds of Apples, Button pears, and horse plums. I sowed this morning a row of Pear seeds, plum stones and seeds of Apples from the young summer house apple tree, in the summer house cellar. Daniel Baxter came with his Deed of the Pine hill lot, and Lemuel Humphrey’s plan of it, making it 15 Acres 1. Rood and 25 Rods, for all which he had charged— There was also yet missing the deed from Caleb to Livingston White, and I told him as all those Lots were originally sold by the town for 15 acres each— I could not take the lot for more. And I thought it probable that, Mr Humphrey’s plan encroached upon my two adjoining lots. I said also that Harvey Field had told me the price of the lot was 495 dollars. he went and soon returned with Caleb White’s deed to Livingston, dated in 1837 and recorded— His own deed to me was made conformable to that from Bracket to the Whites and the consideration for 15 acres only—495 dollars.— I took his deed and the plan, and gave him a check on the stone bank for that sum— This lot, with the three others adjoining it, and the lawyer’s common form are aggregate of 108 acres of woodland all contiguous.— Mr Lunt paid me a morning visit, and said there was to be an ordination, next Wednesday at Chelsea of a young man by the name of Rice, to which our church is invited, and he inquired if I should be willing to accompany him as a delegate— I told him that I was engaged to go to Cambridge on that day to pass the Night at President Quincy’s; but I should not be obliged to go till late in the day, and supposed I could attend the ordination and go afterwards to Cambridge— But there was one suggestion for his consideration rather than mine which had perhaps not occurred to him— I had twice within the last two years attended him as a delegate at Ordinations— Might there not be other members of the church, who would incline to have their turn to partake of these offices, and might think I was engrossing more than my share? He said the idea had never occurred to him— I said he might take time to think of it and I would go with him or give place to another according as he should conclude— I was engaged at least two hours of this morning in examining my Diary, commencing with October 1818, to make extracts of all the notices of the Negotiation of the Florida Treaty with the Spanish Minister Onis. I marked a number of passages which I requested Walter Hellen to copy for me; which he readily promised to do— I proceed in the reading of Bacon’s Works— The Reign of Henry the 7th. is followed by two fragments. One a single page, commencing the History of the reign of King Henry the 8th. The other three pages of the beginning of the History of Great-Britain. Then come Theological works— Then a confession of Faith— Then a confession of Faith by Lord Verulam, and four Prayers by Lord Chancellor Bacon &c. "

Two hours of labour exercise in the garden and seminary— This morning our family visitors from Richmond Virginia, Mrs Susan B Treadway eldest daughter of my long since deceased brother Charles—her daughter Mrs Susan Crane with her husband Adoniram Judson Crane, and their infant Son Joseph Mayo Crane, and his mulatto nurse Julia, left us to return home. They have been with us since theof last Month They have within the last year lost two children, a girl and a boy—the latter being the child with whom the two ladies visited us at Washington in August 1842. The boy now with them has since that time been born and is now about seven months old— Mr Crane is sorely afflicted with the asthma; fits of which he has been suffering almost the whole time that he has been here.— I gave Mr Crane at parting, my three Eulogies, upon Monroe, La Fayette and Madison— The Oration at Newbury-Port— The address of 17. Septr. 1842 to my Constituents at Braintree—the Lecture ofNovember 1842 at Providence, and the Speech of 15 April 1843. at Washington in reply to Wise and C. J. Ingersoll— I asked him also to procure for me if he can a file of the Richmond Enquirer for the year 1818. and a copy of the pamphlet review by professor Dew of the debate in the Legislature of Virginia in 1832. upon a motion for the abolition of Slavery in that State— Mr Carruth and Mr Gilmore are the agents for the company who have obtained a charter for opening a railway from Boston to Plymouth. They have concluded to make the road pass within 20 feet East of my easternmost barn; there to cross the county road and cut diagonally through my lot in front of my house; utterly ruining the finest lot for dwelling houses in the whole town—exposing my barns and houses to the most imminent danger of fire; and sinking to a dead loss my interest in the Neponset Bridge— They talked about an estimate valuation of D. Greenleaf’s land adjoining mine at 100 dollars an acre— I thought it best to have no altercation with them, and referred them entirely to my Son— I took Letters to the Post Office, and called twice at Charles’s—once before dinner, and again at Sunset. Took tea there with my wife who has been most of these last four days there with the child Arthur who has the scarlet fever severely but with favourable symptoms. We came home in the Carryall, and I found at home a young man named Hutchinson from Milton, with a pompous personage from Vermont named Arunah Spear, who came to make enquiry, if I had in my possession certain papers documentary, being a declaration of a man by the name of Allen in Braintree in 1818 said to have been made before Thomas Adams. Allen died within a week of making the declaration; and it is believed that the papers never were sent to Washington but remained in the hands of Mr Thomas Adams and passed into mine. I told him I had none of my brothers official papers— Mr Gourgas or Mrs T. B. Adams might have them. "

Morning hours absorbed in digging round the seedling tree patches in the seminary— Sowing button pear seeds dwarf apple seeds and horse plum stones in a row behind the tool shed—staked with twigs sawed off from a wild cherry tree— There are nine shagbark seedlings, two peach trees, and two pears now there, sown last October, some of which I may hope will survive the approaching winter. five shagbarks in the pumice patch over the fence and one peach— I dug a hole in one corner of it; and emptied into it a basket of rotten button pears and woodhouse apples— In the summer house cellar there are also two shagbark seedlings of last year, and one in the alley next the road— I examined my Diary for November and December 1818. and marked large extracts to be copied— General H. A. S. Dearborn came from Roxbury and delivered to me a Letter from himself, Samuel H. Walley junr. Joseph W. Tucker, and Francis Hilliard—Committee of invitation of the whigs of Roxbury, requesting me to attend at a great meeting of the whigs of Norfolk County, and to address them next Wednesday the 18th. the day before the great mass meeting of the 19th on the Boston Common. I desired the General to return my thanks to the Committee for the honour of the invitation; and to express my regret that the necessity of refraining from attendance at any public meeting having reference to the Presidential election would deprive me of the opportunity of complying with their request. I explained to him my reasons for this forbearance, which he said were perfectly satisfactory, and he agreed with me that this verbal answer, would render a written one unnecessary. Mr Ibrahim Bartlet brought me a manuscript volume of 228 folio pages carefully sowed up in a cotton covering, for me to read and give my opinion upon it. Mr Bartlet reminded me that he had brought me last year the same manuscript for the same purpose; but I had not then time to examine it— I do not remember, nor does Mr Bartlet know who the author of the manuscript is.— After dinner, doctor Edward Jarvis, brought me a Letter of introduction, from Mr Samuel P. Loud of Dorchester where he resides— His wife was with him, and is quite a handsome, well educated and personally accomplished woman— The Doctor was one of the signers of a memorial to H.RU.S. from the American statistical association detecting and exposing the blunders of the Census of 1840.—the Treatment of which by the house and the Committee on Statistics I told him. He said the Society would address another memorial to Congress at their next Session, on the errors of the Census respecting Education, and the returns of schools— I advised him to send the memorial early in the Session within the first 30 days and promised to present it— I was not able to make an addition of more than half a page to my daily task—which needs the spur.

Sun rose beclouded— Set clear  The weather continues excessively dry, with this day a return of Summer heat— My Son’s children Louisa Catherine and John Quincy, who came in yesterday from Boston are with us to keep them away, from Arthur who is yet going through the scarlet fever; still with favourable symptoms— The eruption passing off and the sore throat abated— My wife came home yesterday afternoon from Charles’s house, sick; had a bad night and has been all this day confined to her bed.— The effect of the heat upon my nervous system to disable me for writing is appaling, and irremediable. Mr Lunt preached at home—this morning from Joel. 2.13. “Rend your heart and not your Garments.” The discourse commenced, with an historical account of the different usages among the antient Jews of manifesting their afflictions, by personal acts of violence—by clothing themselves in sackloth, rolling their bodies in ashes, prostrations—scarifying their faces, and among other things rending their garments— He then adduced numerous citations from both the old and new Testament to shew that these practices were disapproved by God, and repeatedly and severely censured by Jesus Christ— He quoted especially the passage in Micah 6.7. and the frequent warnings of Jesus against the hypocritical fasts and ostentatious slovenly manners of the Pharisees— The emphatic precepts in all parts of the Bible against observances merely of form cannot escape the notice of every enquirer after truth. And from the earnest exhortation to despise and discard all such delusive pretensions to sanctity the argument naturally slided into a glowing commendation of pure Christian humility— This book of Joel consisting only of three short chapters, is at the first aspect an outburst of lamentation at the calamity of a land devoured by worms and caterpillars— The canker worm the palmer-worm and the Caterpillar.— These I suppose were metaphorical figures denoting the Babylonian conquerors. All these pictures by the prophets of the dreadful judgment of God in the captivity, are of what Benjamin West used to call the terribly sublime— Mr Lunt’s afternoon text was from Psalm 67.4. [“]O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the Nations upon Earth.” I read also two of the Sermons of Orville Dewey. The 13th. in the volume, being the second upon future retribution—and the first in the volume—upon human nature— My Sons wife has been frightened by the Sermons on retribution— They are of the rigid and gloomy school of theology. Such doctrines, if they cannot breed a hell in the next world, at least make one in this— I have no faith in them—and very little in their author— The Sermon upon humann nature is better, and yet does not entirely satisfactory to my mind.

Erving in 1817 and 18— The supplementary Documents, called for by the Resolution of H.R.U.S. moved by Dixon H. Lewis, are the most perfect extinguishers of Andrew Jackson’s lies, and Erving’s own base misrepresentations that could be produced.— Jackson’s lies are gross and glaring— Erving’s misrepresentations, are artful and cunning— Jackson’s type is Richard the third— Erving is an honest Iago— There is no baser conspiracy recorded in history than theirs against me which it is my duty to expose to the world. Mr Billings came to enquire about the pension claim of his grandmother Lydia Faxon—married a few days after the limitation of 1. Jany 1794. I told him that a great effort had been made at the recent session of Congress to repeal the limitation altogether—but it had failed.— The attempt may be renewed next winter— Mr Cheseborough is a minister of the gospel, settled at Chester in the state of Connecticut; and came with his brother in Law, George H. Chapman, a merchant of Boston, and his brother Robert Chapman, a boy of 15. to enquire if in the old Book of Records of the town of Braintree there is found the name of his lineal ancestor William Cheseborough— He found the name—but there is one paper among the title deeds to the Mount Wollaston Estate, in which Cheseborough was a party, for which I searched, but could not find it.— Upon the earliest list of births Mr Cheseborough found several instances of the name of Sheffield which he said was the name of his mother, and he concluded she was also a descendant from the patriarchal Braintree family. Mr and Mrs Stockton, Mary M’Knight and Miss Ann Twiggs came out and visited us from Boston this afternoon— My wife continues much indisposed and was confined almost the whole of this day to her bed— My Grandson John Quincy went into Boston early to attend the Latin School— My Son was here before dinner, in search of John C. Calhoun’s address to his party friends last January, withdrawing his name as a competitor for nomination at the Democratic convention then to be held at Baltimore the last week in May for the candidate of the party for the Presidency of the United States— I found it for him in the Globe of 5. February last— He went this evening to a whig Meeting at North Bridgewater— This evening I traced in Middleton’s Celestial Atlas, and by inspection of the sky, all the principal stars in the constellation of Draco, which I had never before ascertained.

Mr Loring called here this morning with Mr Hudson a portrait painter residing at Hingham and desirous of painting a picture of me— I gave him accordingly a sitting of an hour and a half, and he dined with us. I could not keep my eyes open half the time while I was sitting— Mr Loring brought us a basket of Seek no further apples—and proceeded to Boston. I had received a note from Robert C. Winthrop inviting me to dine with him, with Mr and Mrs Grinnell who are coming from New-Bedford to spend some days with him— Mr Loring took my answer to his note declining the invitation to dine, being engaged to go to Chelsea, but promising to call on him to-morrow morning. Mr George Newcomb came to enquire about the case of the Schooner Rosanna, a claim in Congress. I told him I believed there had been a report from a Committee of the House favourable to the claim and perhaps a bill reported; but which had not passed, or had failed in the Senate— I said I would call it up again at the next Session. Mr Newcomb asked me if I could furnish him with copies of my speeches, and addresses relating to the right of petition and to Texas, to which I had referred in my recent Letter to Miss Thaxter, at the Hingham celebration of 2. August last— He said he had usually voted with the democratic party here; but there were two things upon which he could not go with them. One was their suppression of the right of petition—and the other was their setting up James K. Polk as President of the United States— I gave him copies of my speech of 25. May 1836. on the rations—of that of May 1840. on the smuggling the Address at Braintree of 17. September 1842. Of my Speech of April 1843. upon War with Mexico and England, and of my Lecture at Providence on the right of suffrage— Messrs. Robbins, Brigham, Guild and Maguire, came as a Committee from the whig convention of the 8th. Congressional District, held at Dedham last Tuesday to fix on a Candidate for election as Representative of the District in the 29th. Congress, to announce to me that I had been unanimously nominated by the Convention for that Office, and that the Convention had thought proper not only to nominate me but to appoint them a special Committee to inform me of it in person.— I thanked them, and the Convention for the honour they had done me; and although my age and infirmities had led me to hesitate whether I should prove sufficient to discharge all the duties of the office, I must hope for improved health and in the crisis impending over the country, accepted the nomination. Henry Wilson of Natick was also one of the Committee to notify me of my nomination, but did not come with the rest. The Convention passed sundry resolutions honorary to me, a Resolution approving the whig nomination for President, and a resolution condemnatory of Polk and Dallas. "

George M Rice, as Pastor of the first Congregational Church and Society in Chelsea, the ceremonies were as follows. 1. Anthem. 2. Introductory prayer by Revd John T. Sargent of Boston. 3. Selections from the Scriptures by Revd John Pierpont junr of Lynn 4. Hymn 5. Sermon by Revd. William P. Lunt of Quincy. 6. Hymn. 7. Prayer of Installation, by Revd. Samuel Barrett of Boston. 8. Charge by Revd. Dr James Flint of Salem 9. Right Hand of fellowship, by Revd. Samuel D. Robbins of Chelsea 10. Address to the People by Revd Robert C. Waterston of Boston 11. Concluding prayer by Revd Frederick T. Gray of Boston 12. Doxology. 13. Benediction by the Pastor George M. Rice— Mr Lunt’s Sermon was from Philippians 3.9.—“the righteousness which is of God by Faith.” All the services were appropriate and creditable— This form of ordaining a minister of the gospel to the charge of a single church is pre-eminently popular and republican— And contrasts most advantageously with the forms of episcopal ordination In these there are two things insupportable, and blasphemous. 1. The pretension of the bishop to confer the holy ghost and 2. the power of pardoning a retaining sin at his discretion. These are the most servile and obsequious vicious practices retained from the church of Rome— Our churches are independent of each other. Associated as brethren— Their pastors are all equal—elected by their people without hierarchy of Bishop Priest and Deacon; without the ridiculous pretension of receiving from the afflatus of the Bishop either the holy ghost or the discretionary power to forgive or to retain sins.— The introductory, ordination, and concluding prayers each by a separate brother pastor— The Anthem, Hymns and Doxology— The Sermon— Charge, Right hand of fellowship and Address to the People, are all congenial parts of one ceremony—all solemnizing incidents of reciprocal duties contracted by the incipient relations between the Pastor and his flock— These services were all well performed on this occasion.— This day was the great Mass Meeting of the whigs at Boston, at which I was invited to preside but declined— Daniel Webster presided and delivered a Speech of an hour and a half— My Son, who is President of the young Men’s whig club went into Boston with Walter Hellen, and my two Granddaughters to see the show.— Mr Hudson the Portrait Painter came and took a sitting of an hour.— The next is to be next Monday— I went up the hill, and saw the sun set from the North-western chamber of Charles’s house— I saw his wife, and her boy Arthur, the glands of whose neck are badly swollen after they had flattered themselves that the scarlet fever had entirely passed off.— Walter and the two girls returned home about 7 this Evening. Charles stays in Boston over night— My wife still keeps her chamber. "

Sun rose 5:  I planted a row of the largest woodhouse apples, six, as many button pears, 6 horse plum stones and one peach stone between two rows of seedling shagbarks behind the tool shed in the garden, placing them all in a bed of dry manure, and staking out the row with two twigs from a wild cherry tree. I had morning visits from Mr Hubbard Hancock of Stow, Vermont, I take it for granted a whig, though he did not say so— Then the Revd. George Allen of Worceter, and his son George Allen junr. of Boston. This Gentleman (the father is one of the finest political writers in this Commonweal), and on the Masonic controversy, the right of petition, and the projected robbery of Mexico, has written and published papers for comprehension of the subjects, soundness of principle, and elegance of composition unsurpassed if not unequalled. I have had some occasional correspondence with him since 1833. but have never seen him till this day— One of the objects of his visit was to enquire if in the old Record Book of Births, Marriages and Deaths in Braintree the name of Allen appeared, about a century and a half back. I got the book, and we found four or five of the name, between 1680. and 1720.— I lent him the book on his promise to return it. Soon after 4 this afternoon I went with my Son into Boston and at his office, executed and acknowledged for my part as one of the Trustees of Ward Nicholas Boylston, before A. C Spooner, the deed in fee of the old house in School Street of Boylston Estate, to Lucius Manlius Sargent of Roxbury for 29500 dollars. I then left my son there and came out to Cambridge on a visit to President Quincy at his invitation, and that of his family; with them I passed a pleasant evening enlivened by the company of several of the professors and other officers of the University— Among them Messrs. Beck, Felton and Bond. The conversation was various, literary, not very scientific, occasionally political, but not controversial and throughout cheerful and good humoured— The only drawback to me, was the continual call upon me for talk, leading me to engross a very disproportionate part of the conversation to myself; an impulse to vanity and self conceit— Towards 11. O’Clock, the company retired— I asked for a lamp and a friction match for the morning, and was shewn by Mr Quincy to my bed chamber. "

Set  Sudden change from midsummer heat and a parching drought— The sear and yellow leaf on many trees, and showers of them fallen and falling from the willows.— The Sun set clear last evening but a Southwest gale had been blowing all day. This morning was cloudy and from 2 to 4 pm this afternoon the was a copious shower of rain— The first fordays— Mr Lunt preached this morning from Philippians 3.9.— “The righteousness which is of God, by Faith.” The same sermon which he preached last Wednesday at the Installation of Mr Rice— It gave me occasion to remark upon the great imperfection of my Memory.— As Mr Lunt read over his sermon I recollected every sentence as I had heard it before. Yet I could not remember one sentence, but as it was repeated to me. Dr Pierce of Brookline has told me of a young woman in his parish who after hearing a sermon once delivered, can go home, and write it out word for word—what a power! and how vainly I have struggled full three score years to retain so much as the substance of discourses that I hear.— Even after twice hearing this sermon of Mr Lunt I could give but a scanty and meagre account of it— The kernel of it is that Faith is the Christian system of morals. He began by observing that it had been cast as a reproach upon Christianity that it had no system of Morals connected with it— Meaning thereby a code of positive precepts, such for example as the decalogue— Mr Lunt presents Faith as in itself a system of morals; and a priesthood and the institution of the Sabbath as schools of moral philosophy.— There is much in this view But in truth the New Testament is itself the most excellent code of ethics in the world, and Jesus was the most perfect of moral teachers— He summed up the whole duty of man in two precepts, the love of God, and the love of his neighbour— He taught his doctrines to the poor— He exemplified them by his life— He sanctioned them by the performance of miracles.— He died and rose from the dead to prove their immortality. Love is to the moral universe, what gravitation is to the physical— One principle, the vital element of all human action, pervading the life of man from the cradle to the grave—all founded upon duty— The basis of Greek and Roman Moral Philosophy was self love. Happiness— There was no word in their languages to express duty— Justice was their moral law— Mercy is the moral law of Christianity— Mr Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from 1. Corinthians 7.31. “And they that use this world as not abusing it.” From which he inferred that there are lawful uses which may be made of the world—and by the world he said might be understood either the people of the world, our fellow tenants of the globe—or the globe itself the tenement of man— Besides these discourses I read two of the volume published by the Revd Orville Dewey, the second upon human nature; and the third upon the wrong which sin does to human Nature— The two sermons on human nature contain an ingenious, benevolent and I believe sound argument against the doctrine of its total depravity— I saw the Sun set from Charles’s house—clear— Mr G. W. Beale here this Evening. "

There was a border cloud over the Sun, at his rising this morning, and the average temperature of the morning atmosphere the last week in September with fair weather disables me for writing— At ten O’Clock Mr Hudson came and engaged me for a sitting until noon— I was much occupied in looking over the file of the last Winter’s Globe to find the letter from Andrew Jackson to Aaron Vail Brown with the mystification of George W. Erving’s treachery, but without success. The Revd. G. D. Garland of Roxbury, a preacher of the Freewill Baptist Society came with a contribution paper for building a church of that denomination to which I put down my name for 5. dollars.— I barely made out my record of yesterday and took a short tour in the garden and nursery when I was called to dinner— Soon after which Dr Dana of Brandon, Vermont came with a Letter recommendatory from William Hayden, Senior editor of the Boston Atlas— He was accompanied by his brother a merchant of Boston. They are fervent whigs, and the only object of their visit was to see and converse with me— While they were here, Mr and Mrs. Birney came in— He is the son of James G. Birney now of Michigan, and the candidate of the Liberty party for election as President of the United States— The Son resides at New-Haven, Connecticut; I met him last week at the office of the Morning Chronicle, in Boston last which, and Mr Leavitt introduced him to me. Why he visits me now I do not know— His father owes me a grudge, and as the head of the abolition Liberty party made a violent and furious assault upon my character and reputation in a Letter to his party— He had perhaps some provocation— When he was going to the first world’s convention at London in 1840. he wrote to me requesting Letters of introduction to my friends in England—a piece of sheer impertinence, for I had no personal acquaintance with him which could warrant me in recommending him to my friends, nor any reason to believe him a man of merit so transcendent that I could venture to recommend him, though a stranger. But as an answer of refusal would have required an assignment of reasons which I knew would be more offensive to him even than neglect, I left his Letter unanswered, and he now assails me in revenge.— He has emancipated some Slaves which he inherited from his father— Has suffered persecution, obloquy and loss for the cause of Liberty for which he is entitled to respect and gratitude. But he is the sport of envious, bitter, ambitious and malignant passions, and his head is turned by the greatness thrust upon him of a party candidate for the presidency.— Charles took his Son John Quincy to Boston to school this morning, and brought him back this Evening.

Sharp frost, and the morning so cold that I was unable to write— We had a fire in the middle room, and the cold shatters my nerves so that I have scarcely the use of my hands— Yet my son has promised the young men’s whig club of Boston that I will deliver to them a political Lecture on the evening of Monday the 7th. of October— Charles is President of that association, and I wish to give him aid as far as may be practicable in the fulfilment of his duties in that capacity— I wished also to take the opportunity to expose the foul conspiracy of Andrew Jackson, George W. Erving, Aaron Vail Brown, Charles Jared Ingersoll, Major Lewis—Dixon H. Lewis and others charging me with a treacherous surrender of Texas to Spain by the Florida Treaty in 1819.— I have written 40 pages, which it would take me two hours and a half to deliver, and I have not yet got half through my defence— I cannot finish before the 7th. of next month, and must deliver it in fragments.— I shudder at the work before me, and despair of making it effective. Mr Hudson came and took a sitting for my portrait— It is so irksome, and so time-consuming, that he has agreed to reduce the sittings to one hour a day, and I have agreed to give him as many sittings as he shall desire. He improved the likeness very much this day. This afternoon Mr Cassius M. Clay came out from Boston, with Mrs George T Bigelow, and Miss Porter daughter of the late General Peter B. Porter, to visit us. Mr C. M. Clay is a native of Kentucky, and within the last two years has acquired great celebrity by declaring the highest toned sentiments against Slavery— He has in numerous public speeches advocated the abolition of Slavery in that State; has raised against himself hosts of deadly enemies, and has been more than once hunted for assassination.— He has emancipated a number of his own slaves. Last winter he attended a meeting called by Colonel Johnson to pass Resolutions for the annexation of Texas to the United States and he prevented the passage of the Resolutions He is now travelling about the Northern States, discoursing wherever he goes against Slavery, the Slave trade and the annexation of Texas. His wife is with him, said to be a very fine woman; but has been taken ill in Boston, and could not come out with him this afternoon— He has made several speeches at Boston, and is said to be transcendently eloquent He told me that his speech to the Boston young men’s whig club, was reported in the Atlas of this morning; and requested me to read it and write to him at New-York my opinion of it. He also said that he had derived his principles in part from me— Charles here this evening. "

The third cause, anxiety for my task I cannot shake off— Mr Loring called this morning on his way from Hingham to Boston, and gave me a letter from Francis Hilliard, Chairman of the whig Committee of the 8th. Congressional District, inviting me to address my Constituents and the public, at such time and place as may be most convenient and agreeable to myself— This is a new burden which I must assume, and I desired Mr Loring to say to Mr Hilliard that having promised to address the young men’s whig club at Boston next Monday week, I must ask for time to prepare for another address to my Constituents, probably till towards the close of the next month; and will answer his Letter in time to give ample notice to the people of the whole district of the time and place when and where I may address them— Mr Loring inclined to Dorchester or Roxbury, and to the Evening rather than the day-time— He called again this afternoon on his return from Boston to Hingham. I had agreed with him to go upon a fishing excursion to Cohasset to morrow. But the weather was lowering, and we both expected foul weather to-morrow. We determined therefore to postpone indefinitely the party to Cohasset—especially as he says the Cod have forsaken the fishing grounds on the coast for the Season, and that there has been but one Cod in Boston market for the last ten days. Mr Hudson came and took an hour sitting for my portrait— He is to come again on Friday— He inclines to take the hands, and we had a long consultation how to dispose of them— Charles took his son John Quincy again to Boston to attend school— He came out yesterday because it was holiday for a muster— And Charles remains in Boston over this Night— I wrote with great difficulty and a trembling hand—excessively hurried— In reviewing the Negotiations with Spain which terminated by the conclusion of the Florida Treaty, the subject spreads and widens under my hand— It goes back not only to the negotiation of the Louisiana Treaty in 1803. but to the suspension of the deposit at New-Orleans in 1802— To Thomas Pinckney’s Treaty of 1795— To the Negotiations of John Jay and Gardoqui about the Navigation of the Mississippi in 1786.— And to the cobwebs spun by France and Spain during the war of our Revolution, to exclude us from the right of navigating the Mississippi, and from the country bordering on that river and its tributaries.— But I must stop far short of all this— I begin with G. W. Erving’s Commission, full power and intructions as Minister to Spain in 1816.—but must look back to the Negotiation of James Monroe and Charles Pinckney with Don Pedro Cevallos in 1805 and not wholly overlook the Louisiana Treaty purchase in 1803. I was most laboriously occupied upon this work till 10 O’Clock this evening and then went to bed, labouring with it in my head. "

There was some rain in the course of the last Night but it began in earnest about the hour of my rising, and continued without abatement till near Noon— It was well that we had agreed to postpone indefinitely our fishing party to Cohasset, and as I have promised to address two public meetings before the first of November, my anxiety to prepare for both of them becomes from day to day more and more intense. After all the trouble and pains I have taken to draw up an Address to my Constituents I find that it wants unity of subject, point, for impression, good humour to hit the fancy and secure the sympathy of the auditory, and pleasantly to amuse them— All these are essential to popular eloquence— There is nothing so fatal to the success of stump speaking as dulness— Tous les genres sont bons, hormis le genre ennuyeux— I have analysed the correspondence furnished in answer to the call moved by Dixon H. Lewis in the House of Representatives on the 29th. of April last, and every page of it furnishes pregnant evidence to refute the lies of Andrew Jackson, Aaron Vail Brown, George W. Erving, and Charles Jared Ingersoll, every one of whom lies without remorse, but with variety of falsehood, which makes each of them an effective witness against all the others. But it will require extreme caution to compare and collate with one another all the documents heretofore published; the new ones recently produced and the false statements of each of the four false witnesses— And I never can be too much on my guard to avoid contesting any well attested statement, and to make none on my part susceptible of being disproved— We had visits this afternoon from Mr and Mrs R. C. Waterston, and my Son who had passed last Night in Boston to attend a supper party of the young men’s whig club, returned home this day, and spent the evening with us— He brought out the Boston Post of 25. March 1844. containing Andrew Jackson’s Letter to Aaron V. Brown of 12. Feby 1843. which he has borrowed from the files of the Boston Atlas. I have been for weeks wanting this paper without being able to find it; and I still want the Letter of Aaron V. Brown to the Editors of the Globe communicating Jackson’s Letter for publication— My Son brought me a declaration of Mary Jennison, widow of William Jennison, an Officer of the Revolutionary War, and of the Boston Frigate in 1778. to obtain an increase of pension— He brought also a Letter from Jonathan Amory of Roxbury, soliciting in case of a vacancy at West Point a warrant for his son Thomas C. Amory now at school under the charge of Mr Daniel Leach— Mr Amory encloses a certificate of Mr Leach to the moral character, intelligence and proficiency in study of the youth for whom the warrant is desired. These two subjects will require my attention at Washington next December. "

The spy-glass in the hand will distinguish it from all other portraits of me. The Boston morning Post of 25. March last, which my Son brought out for me last evening enabled me to find this morning the Globe of 21. March 1844. upon the files which I had brought from Washington, and which I had not hitherto been able to find— It is better for my purpose than the Boston Post, because it contains the original publication by Aaron Vail Brown, of Jackson’s Letter, and further, the Letter from Brown, to the Editors of the Globe, Blair and Rives, enclosing Jackson’s Letter for publication. I have determined to make this the immediate and single subject of my Address to the young men’s whig club at Boston, next Monday week— First, for the vindication of my own character, from the vile Slanders, of Jackson, Erving, Brown, and Charles J. Ingersoll—and secondly, to expose to the world, and to after times the infamous means used to accomplish this annexation of Texas to the United States— How far this selection of my subject will be satisfactory to those whom I am to address; how far to the free people of this Union—how far I shall be able to enliven it with interest is a problem from which I would shrink if I could.— I have fearful odds to encounter; and little to encourage me—  My Polar star must be my guide— The Florida Treaty was the most important incidents in my life; and the most successful Negotiation ever consummated by the Government of this Union— And this is precisely selected above all others as an engine for the total destruction of my good name and to charge me with treachery to my country and to my trust— I have long hesitated, not whether I should notice this conspiracy against me; but how, and when— I have taken time to look over the documents, and can wind the whole body of the conspirators round my fingers— My only danger, is of losing my vantage ground. I went up the hill at Sunset and was forthwith called back to see Mr John Foster and a Mr Adams from Kentucky— Charles and his wife, first time for these three weeks, spent the Evening here. "

Till then I saw Venus, but then she vanished from my sight— The sky was crystal clear, and the Mercury in my Dresden thermometer at 32.  The names in the margin are of the members of the Committee of the Liberty party of the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts, who visited me this morning. They have appointed this day week for a convention to nominate a candidate for election to the house of Representatives of the United States in the 29th. Congress.— They have heretofore not nominated a candidate against me—but they will at this time, and it is highly probable will defeat the election— They were however to me this day peculiarly courteous and civil— Mr Fisher said they had no disposition to dictate opinions to me, nor to ask any pledge of me, which it might be disagreeable to me to give, but they had come to the conclusion that they were under obligations of duty to vote exclusively for persons who entertained certain opinions on the subject of Slavery, and all they were fully aware of the great and frequent services that they were indebted to me for, in support of the cause which they had so much at heart, they wished for this friendly interview to ascertain my opinions on certain points upon which there was considerable adversity among those generally opposed to Slavery.— I told them that I would cheerfully give to them my opinions as they were sincerely entertained, upon any and every point interesting to them— That I had no motive to conceal or disguise any of my opinions upon subjects of public concernment— That I had lived 77 years and served in various offices, and never asked or solicited directly or indirectly the vote of any man, and thought it not worth while to commence the practise now— I answered all their questions; discussed with them the points upon which we did not concur— The vote for President upon which I should not be the partizan of any man.— We considered the abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia and the territories and the prohibition of the interstate Slave-trade. They declared themselves perfectly satisfied with the interview— One of them said he should vote for me with pleasure—another said he did not know but what he should— The rest were silent. I asked them for their names; which one of them brought me on cards, from French’s tavern where they dined Mr Fisher said they expected at this election to cast from 1400 to 1600 votes. Charles and his wife were here this Evening. "

The temple clock, struck six as about 4 digits of the Sun’s disk had appeared above the horizon, and as he rose Venus vanished from sight on the firmament— My visitors yesterday from the Committee of the Liberty party were apparently not of one mind when they came nor yet when they left me. My opposition to the immediate abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia, and in the Territories, they all disapprove, and Mr Howe the late Senator from Norfolk County in the State Legislature pressed me specially with the question whether Congress have not the power to repeal the Laws of the District which allow and sanction Slavery— With regard to the inter-state Slave trade I told them I had no doubt of the power of Congress to prohibit that, and would vote for a bill to that effect to-morrow, though it would not be possible to prevail upon the house to receive such a bill— I told them I regretted that I could not concur with them in all their opinions, and still more the dissensions prevailing among themselves— The Colonization Society— The Anti-Slavery and abolition Societies—the no-government non resisting and women membered Societies— I grieved also at their classing in the same level of exclusion the whig and democrat parties.— I thought there was a great difference between them; and that placing them on the same level was to secure the triumph of the worst party— This tendency of all private associations to settle into factious cabals is the besetting sin of all elective governments— I had no visitors this day— This Evening my Son, with Walter Hellen, Mary Louisa, and Louisa Catherine and John Quincy whom they took up in Boston, went to the Melodeon, and saw the Tragedy of Hamlet performed, the part of Hamlet by Macready— It was close upon 1. of to-morrow morning when they got home excepting John Quincy 3. who remained in Boston to attend the Latin school— I received this morning from Mr N. Frye at Washington the daily Globe of 20 March 1844. containing the Letters of Aaron Vail Brown and Andrew Jackson upon the annexation of Texas to the United States— I employed so industriously this day that besides the daily record I wrote 4 pages of my task, only to prove what with diligence can do in one day.— The danger now is that I shall do too much—slide into dulness, wander into impertinence, fret into ribaldry and worry into tediousness— The conspiracy against my good name is so complicated, so combined so crafty and so base that I can scarcely keep my self-command to meet it— "

O’Clock p.m to-morrow— I took ten tickets and promised to attend the meeting in person, if I should find it convenient— My Son went this morning with his son Charles Francis to the granite quarries, where Mr Lemuel Humphrey of Weymouth had engaged to meet him to make a survey and take a plan of a lot of mine there— He intended to have returned home to dinner; but the work took the day, and was still left unfinished— At the setting of the Sun I went up the hill where his wife told me that he had not returned and she knew not where he was— I came back to enquire of Benjamin F Andrews where he had left him this morning; but James Davenport their servant followed close after me and told me that Mr Charles with his Son had returned. Though I had the whole day for my labour I was able to write only three pages of my task, and find I shall be obliged to curtail and concentrate much of what I have yet to say on Monday next— In the Evening Charles came down—without his wife, and I read to the family what I have already written for the address of next Monday.— It occupied an hour and a half, and I suppressed the reading of several documents, which I must not pass over next Monday.— I must bespeak the patience of my hearers a full hour longer and then abridge and leave out— But what is worse my language is too violent, and must be smoothed down, I know not how nor to what extent—further I have now only four days more to finish, and must leave space for a final recapitulation— I read myself this evening quite hoarse, and took warning to pitch my voice quite low when I begin— All my correspondence lags behind and I leave unanswered numerous invitations, and complimentary Letters. Walter Hellen has completed for me a large collection of extracts from my Diary of 1818 and 1819. which I much wanted at Washington last Winter; and of which I want that more than one copy should be in existence to guard against the casualty of fire, and the possibility of theft or mutilation— The Steamer Caledonia arrived from Liverpool at Boston this morning at ten O’Clock, in the average Summer passage of 14 days, and with the average number of 101. passengers.

As the evening twilight came on I took my hat to go up to Charles’s house, when two strangers came in and introduced themselves as Mr Wilson of Missouri and Mr Haven of New-York city— They are whig politicians and came to see me from mere curiosity to see and talk with me— Mr Wilson said he had been settled in Missouri nearly 25. years, and most of that time in opposition to Coll. Thomas H Benton, whose recent movements against the annexation of Texas were caused by his knowledge that nothing else could have saved him politically in Missouri— The people there were all of them perfectly willing to take Texas, and to fight the Mexicans, or the British—but they have an abhorrence to being burdened to pay the debt of Texas which they know will amount to nearer twenty five than ten millions of dollars, and they know that if Texas should be annexed to the United States there will not come to them one acre of ungranted land— Mr Wilson discoursed thus for at least an hour with little interruption from me— Mr Haven said little— I invited them to take tea with us, but they said it was growing late and they must return to Boston— They were scarcely gone, and our tea table cleared when Mr Edward M. Clymer a Student at the Law school at Cambridge, came with a Letter of recommendation from his uncle William Hiester of New Holland Pennsylvania— Mr Clymer’s object was only to spend an evening with us which he did— He is a pleasant very well bred and sociable young man, whom I regretted not to have convenient means to pass the Night with us. Charles and his wife also spent the evening here— The news by the Caledonia and other newspaper intelligence absorbed hours, and a private Letter from George W. Erving to me in the pamphlet, of 1. March 1818 referred me to one that I had received from in London after my appointment as Secretary of State, and before I embarked to return home. Walter Hellen searched and found it for me and with it a file of Letters from him received by me in England from 1815 to 1817. The one of which I was in search contained a quotation from a Latin poet, not of the hacknied class, and I lost some time in searching for it, in vain— And more time in reading over the file. "

Carr the tenant of my homested farm came to me this morning from a whig committee with a subscription paper promising to pay blank sums, for the circulating papers among the people; and other expenses of the Committee, which I declined to subscribe, observing to Mr Carr that I thought there would be an impropriety in my contributing money for such a purpose, and by the indefinite terms in which the paper was drawn up it would be the incipient entrance upon a practise making all elections venal, and setting up all public offices at auction to the highest bidder. Mr Dudley Williams of Roxbury with his wife was here with a Document certified by John G. Palfrey Secretary of the Commonwealth, being the declaration of Hannah Allen now widow of Richard Allen, but heretofore widow of Zebulon Thayer, and a claimant for a pension— Her maiden name was White, and she says she went to school with me to Nathan Rice— Besides her declaration there are affidavits of Bryant Newcomb, and Dudley Williams—and Certificates from Judson Stoddard town Clark of Braintree—Samuel F. M’Cleary City Clerk, William T. Andrews Justice of the Peace and Sherman Leland judge of Probate for the County— Mr Williams requested me to transmit these papers to the commissioners of pensions which I promised to do. Mr and Mrs Sidney Brooks came out from Boston, and dined with My Son up the hill— They went to Europe in 1842 for the recovery of his health, in which he has been partially successeul.— They returned in the last Steamer, and are to resume in a few weeks their residence at New-York— There he has been many years in partnership of trade with Charles Augustus Davis— They returned to Boston immediately after dinner, and they were scarcely gone, when Charles’s wife was taken suddenly ill and took to her bed— Dr Woodward was sent for, and I came home in grief and alarm from the house to which I had gone for festivity and joy.— How pungent is the feeling of such vicissitudes! I laboured hard at my task— Walter Hellen found for me the file of Letters from George W. Erving, which I received in England from 1815 to 1817. and among them was the one I wanted, an exquisite curiosity at this day— A Letter from Madrid of 3. May 1817. containing a classical quotation of Latin poetry, which after diligent search, consuming no small time I found was from Propertius 2.20.32— Three lines and two words— They are the key to Mr George W. Erving’s Revelation’s to President Jackson in 1829 and 1832— They were a supplication to me from Erving to raise him from the Hell of Madrid to the Heaven of Paris. "

Communion day  I attend meeting at the Temple in the hope of composing my shattered nerves and abstracting my agitated bosom from the cares of the world and the interests of Time— This is peculiarly my desire on the days when I partake of the communion— This day, with sorrow I says was too much absorbed by this world, and too little to that at the verge of which I stand— Heaven forgive me for it! Mr Lunt preached this morning from John 12.27. [“]Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this hour.” This is part of a discourse of Jesus only six days before his last Passover at Bethany where he had performed the miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead— Here it was that between the worship of those who had witnessed the miracle and believed him to be the Messiah; and the compassing of his death by those who disbelieved, which was within one week of being consummated, his soul was troubled— He revealed himself and the destiny that awaited him, in figurative and, somewhat misterious, discourse, not understood even by his disciples, until explained by his subsequent death and resurrection; and foretold at once his suffering and his glorification— Mr Lunt’s view of his text appeared to me ingenious and impressive as he delivered his sermon; but other thoughts were forcing themselves upon my memory while he spoke, and my soul was like one of those sheets of antient parchments, upon which a poem in monkish rhyme is written over an Oration of Cicero. Mr Lunt administered the communion and the usual annual collection was taken up to defray the expenses of this ordinance— He also reminded the members of the church of a resolution within the last year adopted, that two blank books should be purchased, one for a copy to be made in it of the antient records of the church, and the other in which the future records may be kept— The change in the time of meeting from ten, to half past ten in the morning, and from a quarter past to a quarter before 2. in the afternoon commenced this day.— On returning from the morning service I found Mr Degrand who dined and spent the day with us.— After dinner Mr Joseph Angier of Milton preached in exchange with Mr Lunt, from James 2.8. “If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, as thyself, ye do well”— Mr Degrand left us to return to Boston about 7. in the evening, and from that time till midnight I was writing at my task without coming to a close— Charles had gone to Boston this morning, was at meeting this afternoon, and here this Evening.

March 1844 containing Brown’s Letter to the Editors of the Globe, with Jackson’s Letter for publication— I determined to make them the text of the address which I had promised to deliver to the young men’s whig club of Boston this Evening.— I thought this a suitable occasion for opening my defence before the country and the world, against the conspiracy of Andrew Jackson, Aaron Vail Brown, George W. Erving and Charles J. Ingersoll, with their coadjutors and tools, to ruin my good name, and fabricate a fable to justify the robbery of Texas from Mexico, by the pretence that Texas had been by me treacherously surrendered to Spain— I began the address that day, and finished it this day just in time for dinner— The composition therefore is excessively hurried and unskilfully put together, with sundry repetitions, which needed a pruning hand; but I had no time to give— At 6 O’Clock this afternoon I rode into Boston with my Son and Walter Hellen, and precisely at 7. alighted at the Tremont Temple— I was there received with the utmost simplicity by the Committee of the young men’s whig club, in a private room adjoining the hall which was already crowded as full as it could hold— Several of my elderly friends were assembled in this private room and I was specially greeted by Samuel T. Armstrong, Jeremiah Mason, Abbott Lawrence, Stephen C. Phillips, Robert C. Winthrop, Josiah Quincy junr. Samuel H. Walley junr. and several others. Mr Hayden Editor of the Boston Atlas, Erastus Brooks of the New-York Evening Express, and the younger Buckingham, applied for the use of my manuscript for immediate publication in their respective papers— I gave it with a pledge that I should have a proof sheet to revise before publication, to Mr Hayden the first applicant— At precisely half past 7. I entered the Hall with my Son, who is President of the club, and with the chairman of the Committee of the Club. The reception was complimentary and enthusiastic, and my Son said that after such a reception, it would be superfluous for him to do more than announce to them the name of his father John Quincy Adams—whereupon another shout of welcome shook the house— A young Mr Coffin at my request read the Letters of Aaron Vail Brown and of Andrew Jackson, and I discoursed upon them two hours and ten minutes much to the amusement of the Auditory— The closing Apostrophe to the young men of Boston was specially well received. As soon as the crowd was cleared away we re-entered the Carriage; left my son at the United States Hotel, and with Walter Hellen I returned to Quincy—reaching home at eleven. "

                "text": "7. V. Monday.  This was one of the epochal days of my life— On the 26th of last month my son brought me the Boston Post of 25. March containing Andrew Jackson’s Letter to Aaron Vail Brown of 12. Feby 1843. The next morning I found on my file, the semi-weekly Globe of 21. March 1844 containing Brown’s Letter to the Editors of the Globe, with Jackson’s Letter for publication— I determined to make them the text of the address which I had promised to deliver to the young men’s whig club of Boston this Evening.— I thought this a suitable occasion for opening my defence before the country and the world, against the conspiracy of Andrew Jackson, Aaron Vail Brown, George W. Erving and Charles J. Ingersoll, with their coadjutors and tools, to ruin my good name, and fabricate a fable to justify the robbery of Texas from Mexico, by the pretence that Texas had been by me treacherously surrendered to Spain— I began the address that day, and finished it this day just in time for dinner— The composition therefore is excessively hurried and unskilfully put together, with sundry repetitions, which needed a pruning hand; but I had no time to give— At 6 O’Clock this afternoon I rode into Boston with my Son and Walter Hellen, and precisely at 7. alighted at the Tremont Temple— I was there received with the utmost simplicity by the Committee of the young men’s whig club, in a private room adjoining the hall which was already crowded as full as it could hold— Several of my elderly friends were assembled in this private room and I was specially greeted by Samuel T. Armstrong, Jeremiah Mason, Abbott Lawrence, Stephen C. Phillips, Robert C. Winthrop, Josiah Quincy junr. Samuel H. Walley junr. and several others. Mr Hayden Editor of the Boston Atlas, Erastus Brooks of the New-York Evening Express, and the younger Buckingham, applied for the use of my manuscript for immediate publication in their respective papers— I gave it with a pledge that I should have a proof sheet to revise before publication, to Mr Hayden the first applicant— At precisely half past 7.

In the hurry of preparation for the last evening my diary has run three days in arrear, and the high excitement of yesterday with more than two hours of loud speaking, preceded and followed by the rides have left upon me a feverish lassitude, and longing for a vacation ill-suited to my condition— I am to address my constituents the people of the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts before the last of this month— I ought to have been at work upon it this day but could not bring myself to it. I allowed myself about three hours to transport three seedling stocks of pear trees, and one shag-bark walnut tree from the Nursery to the Seminary: a very hazardous operation, and of the success of which I despair even while undertaking it. The trees are of six or seven years growth and would flourish in their native soil; but they stand too near other yet more valuable trees, and must be removed from their proximity—the walnut had a double tap root which John Kirk could not extract from the rock-bound soil, and of which he cut off with the spade a large portion— My Son remained last Night in Boston, and took lodging at the United States Hotel to start early this morning on the Western Railroad for Springfield, where he is to address a whig Meeting this Evening— To morrow and Thursday he is to perform the same service at other places; and to return home next Friday. The Atlas and the Boston Courier of this morning have notices of the meeting of the Young men’s whig club last Evening at the Tremont Temple, and very commendatory accounts of my Address which the Atlas promises to give from my Manuscript Notes to-morrow— But I received no proof sheet. I had engaged to pass the Night at Mr James H Foster’s if I had remained in the City. Mr Josiah Quincy junr. also offered me a bed, and judge John Davis engaged me to dine with him on the next day of Meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society— My time was so wholly absorbed yesterday that I could not even read the Boston Morning Newspapers— The State-elections keep up the political agitation— The accounts from Delaware are very equivocal—from Maryland encouraging, but with a dark spot from the City of Baltimore. From Pennsylvania and New-York they are desperate, and the general result is equally so. Maine has gone by a majority of more than ten thousand for free trade and Texas.— It is hard to steer and row against wind and tide; but even in the agony of death we must say like Lawrence don’t give up the ship.

The moon had just risen when I rose, and having been yesterday in conjunction with Venus, I hoped to see them both at the rising of the Sun; but as the morning dawn advanced a hazy vapour arose and covered the atmosphere—the Sun rose with a crimson colour, and a smoky outline, and the day was the entrance to the Indian Summer.— I redeemed the arrears of my Diary, and began an address to my constituents, which I propose to have in readiness for the 30th. of this month— But it will absorb all my time so that I can do nothing else— I set out upon a new plan, and consider all that I have written from the 13th. of July when I got home till the 26th. of September as waste paper. My Address to the young whigs of Boston was published entire in the Boston Atlas of this day; but the paper did not come to me— The Morning Chronicle, the Liberty party paper of yesterday had not even a notice of the Meeting of the whig club of the night before— This day it has a very favourable account of the Address, specially remarking that there was not a word in it about the Presidential election or the Presidential candidates— Yesterday was the day of the Meeting of the Liberty party Convention to nominate candidates for Senators for the County of Norfolk; and for a member of the House of Representatives of the United States for the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts in the 29th. Congress. I received on Monday two Letters from John Gulliver, of Roxbury, one of the Liberty party Committee, who conferred with me on the 1st. of this month—extremely anxious between the fear that the Meeting would, and the hope that they would not nominate a Candidate against me— There is in the Morning Chronicle of this day no notice of the Meeting at Dedham yesterday— The Democratic party have nominated Isaac G. Wright who was last year one of the Senators for the County of Norfolk in the Legislature of the State. Mr Josiah Savil came this afternoon to enquire concerning certain papers, which he says were put into my brother Thomas’s hands shortly before his death, relating to the claim of Charles Newcomb, a revolutionary Soldier for bounty Lands— Newcomb was a pensioner under the act of Congress of 1818. The pension was revoked by the act of 1820.— He died soon after the papers were put into my brothers hands—and his widow Jerusha Newcomb who was a daughter of Micajah Adams is now entitled to a pension by the 5 years laws.— I referred Mr Savil to Mr Gourgas for the papers, and asked him for a written statement, to which I would attend.

I went up the hill to see both the rising and setting of the Sun, but before he rose the haze gathering over the Eastern horizon thickened so that I could discern only the outline of his disk, and at his setting although distinctly visible till he drew within a disk’s distance of the western, he had totally disappeared behind the haze before reaching its border. It was a genuine Indian Summer day, occupied as I would that all my days should be, with no unnecessary intermission, and writing the record of yesterday, and three pages of task— I cannot do more— Mr Beman is a coloured man about 3 4ths. white who came with a subscription paper for the Methodist-Episcopal Zion Church at Boston.— He is the Pastor of that Church, and one of the Clerks in the morning Chronicle Office.— A young man by the name of Ebenezer Wiley from South Reading in the County of Middlesex came to see me, from motives of mere curiosity— I was somewhat inquisitive about himself, but he was not much disposed to talk about himself, and I did not press enquiry.— Henry Hardwick came again to propose the purchase of that corner of land behind his house, which he has so long coveted. I promised to go and see the place or to ask my son to see it, for Mr Hardwick assured me repeatedly assured me that he would give for it double what it was worth— I paid to my wife the bequest of her brother Thomas B. Johnson and she went into Boston this afternoon, with her two Grand daughters Mary Louisa and Louisa Catherine and Walter Hellen— He brought me out the Boston Atlas of yesterday containing my address to the young men’s whig Club of Monday Evening published entire but with sundry considerable errors of the press.— About half of my address copied from the Atlas is published in the Boston Courier and in the Daily Advertiser of this day. The latter with a very favourable editorial notice— The first accounts came in this day of State Government elections in New-Jersey and Pennsylvania— The first favourable to the whigs— The second far otherwise— Both parties have Committees remaining at Washington during the recess, to superintend the issuing of documents and the circulation of intelligence— Willis Green of Kentucky is the Chairman of the whig-Committee— Robert J. Walker the Senator from Mississippi chairman of the democracy.— Walker printed a pamphlet—an Address of the Democratic Association at Washington D.C— Headed the South in Danger— Read before you vote.— Green undertook to circulate the same pamphlet in the North and the Democrats charged him with forgery.

My time is so thoroughly consumed in reading and writing on days occupied as this has been, that when it has passed I have nothing to tell— I had two Pear trees and two plum trees transplanted into the Nursery, and devoted an hour to the thinning of my seedlings in the Nursery. The two persons by the name of Coe were strangers from Connecticut the first, Minister of an episcopal church at Bethlehem, Litchfield County and the other from Winchester in the same County. They came to see me, merely for curiosity and the younger brother said that if he had returned home without seeing me, his father would not have forgiven him. My Son came back from his excursion to Springfield, Westfield and Cabotville where he has been making speeches the last three evenings— He comes with a severe cold, and weary of the office he had undertaken— Ruth Turner was here at work; Walter Hellen went to Boston to see Macready perform in a new Tragedy called the Bridal— I examined at last the publication in the Atlas of my Address to the young men’s whig club. The remainder of it is published in the Boston Courier, and I suppose in the Daily Advertiser of this day.— There are a few mistakes of the press in the Atlas—none of much importance except the word vaccination for buccination, which is ridiculous, and the more so because buccination is not a legitimate word, but one which I sported for the benefit of Aaron Vail Brown— Buccino is the Latin word for swelling the cheek to blow the trumpet or the horn, and there is a picture in the word— I made a noun substantive of it by the common analogy of Latin verbs turned into english nouns.— The compositor of the Atlas was not scholar enough to perceive it and substituted for it a word, which turned the whole sentence into nonsense— The returns of the elections continue to come in most unpropitious— The whigs have indeed carried the election in New Jersey and Stratton will be the Governor of the State— But Pennsylvania is irretrievably sunk in Democracy, and her most popular statesmen are trickish and unsafe— My projected address expands as I proceed— I am still wandering among first principles and generalities— I wish to call the attention of my countrymen to the pernicious feature of the slave-representation in the Government of the United States; but the people are so broken to it, that it is of no avail to expose it— I have yet much to unfold of the Tennessean conspiracy of Jackson, Erving, Aaron Vail Brown and Charles Jared Ingersoll against me, but I am yet uncertain whether now is the most favourable time for completing the exposure, or whether to wait.

The sharpest morning of the Season yet— A more splendid exhibition of the starry firmament I never witnessed than that of this morning immediately after I arose— And among the numberless multitudes of assembled worlds, the planet Mercury shot his seldom visible but brilliant solitary beam into my window, about a quarter of an hour risen precisely in the track in which he was to be followed by the Sun— I ought to have seen the rising of Arcturus, just now rising long enough before the Son to be visible in the morning. Within a week of Starlight mornings I shall see him. My fingers and feet were pinched to see the rising of the Sun from the corner of Charles’s house; but it was a glorious sight— The surface of the ground wherever the eye could range was covered with hoar frost; but the temperature of the atmosphere softened much in the course of the day.— The Revd. Augustus R. Pope, of Kingston, near Plymouth officiated at the Temple by exchange with Mr Lunt. His morning text was from Luke 22.32. “But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren.” It is the saying of the Saviour to Peter, forewarning him of his approaching desertion at the last Supper.— Mr Pope remarked upon the strangeness of the fact, that Jesus, the Messiah, at the moment when he was about to suffer an ignominious death, should have prayed that the faith of his disciple Peter might not fail, when he knew and foretold to Peter himself that it would— But he foretold also that Peter would recover from the fall of his frailty, and exhorts him when he is converted to strengthen his brethren— The Sermon was chiefly a discourse upon Faith— Simon (Peter’s) faith was to fail notwithstanding the prayer of Jesus—he was yet to be converted, and then was to strengthen the faith of his brethren. Since my own Dissertation upon Faith, which palls a little upon my Memory I have heard several Sermons from Clergymen on the same Subject, all of which have given me further ideas regarding it, but none has presented an exact analysis of it as an intellectual and sensitive property of men. Mr Pope enumerated the various senses in which the word Faith is used in the Scriptures without remarking upon the analogy between them— He dined with us, and I made several enquiries of him concerning the family of old judge Sever, at whose house I once slept in April 1787. and of his son, John Sever my Classmates— They are both long since dead but many descendants of John and his brother James remain. Mr Pope’s afternoon Sermon was from James 1.22. [“]But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.” After the service I called to see Mrs Charles who still keeps her bed— He was here this evening. "

I said it was not yet, but I expected it would be— He said the whig Committee had voted last Saturday Evening to purchase 200 copies of it for circulation— This explains the application of J. J. Carr to me for a contribution. Bass said he took the half weekly Daily Advertiser and had seen only the first half of my address; but he referred to so many passages in it, that he shewed he had read it attentively— My Son went to Boston this morning and took his boy John Quincy into the Latin School. He returned and dined with us, and was here again in the Evening. He brought out a note of invitation to him and to me, from William Sawyer, to dine with him to-morrow— I received from President Quincy last week an invitation to attend the exhibition at Cambridge to-morrow— Before we had finished our dinner William Jackson of Newtown and his brother Francis Jackson came in; returning from a tour to Plymouth to examine the course of the Old Colony Rail-road.— William Jackson is the Candidate of the Liberty party for the Office of Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth. Francis Jackson is of the party who take no part in the Government because it requires an Oath to support the Constitution of the United States— William Jackson told me that he went to the Liberty party Convention last week at Dedham to prevent if possible the nomination of a Candidate for Congress against me— But he found it impossible— They were exceedingly zealous. He said he hoped I should be re-elected, but considered it doubtful— Mr William H. Story came from Brooklyn, New-York, with an invitation to me to preside over a whig mass-meeting there, on the 24th. of this month, which I declined, and I wrote also to Mr Halsey declining the invitation to read my address to the young men of Boston, on the Evening of the 23d at the Tabernacle in New-York. I regret much that I could not accept that invitation— Ruth Turner was again here this day— In the evening came on rain and the prospect of foul weather to morrow— My task is the daily page of the journal and three pages of preparation for the address to my Constituents.

                "text": "16. IV. Wednesday  Excessively hurried and delayed— My Son removed this day with his family to Boston— The further I proceed in my task, the more the field widens before me. I had received a Letter of the 24th of last Month from Francis Hilliard of Roxbury, Chairman of the whig Committee of the 8th Congressional District, inviting me to address my Constituents and the public, at such time and place as might be convenient and agreeable to myself— I had then just agreed to address the young men’s whig club at Boston, and had not even commenced that address.— I sent word by Mr Loring to Mr Hilliard, that I would comply with that invitation and fix the time and place for it after getting through with the young men of Boston— Ever since the 7th. I have been intending to write to Mr Hilliard, but he called on me this morning for my answer— I proposed to him this day fortnight the 30th. of this month at 10. O’Clock in the morning.— The place I left entirely at the discretion of the Committee to select; wishing only to suit the persons who will be likely to attend, that they may be put to as little inconvenience as possible— I had suggested to Mr Loring the expediency of notifying the towns of the District and proposing to them to send delegations to attend the meeting, which Mr Hilliard said he thought they would do.— With regard to the place Mr Hilliard went and consulted with Mr Brigham, and returned and said they proposed to apply for the use of the church at the Weymouth landing to which I readily agreed. He asked if I thought of adding any religious solemnity to the meeting. I said I should be glad that the meeting should be opened with prayer, by the Minister of the Church, or if he should be reluctant by Dr Richard Storrs the Minister of the next Orthodox Church at Braintree— And so the arrangement was concluded— Mr George S. Foster is a young man, a member of the Young Men’s Henry Clay Association of New York.— He came for the purpose of persuading me to attend at their mass meeting next Wednesday, and to deliver over again that evening in the Tabernacle, my address to the young Men of Boston— I told him how much I regretted that I could not perform and that I had answered the invitation from Mr Halsey to that effect. He then said that they would have a printing press in the procession, and want an address to be struck off and circulated while the procession is moving. He urged me very warmly to write such an address but I declined. I wasted too much time and a little anger upon a Letter of Langdon Cheves about the Tariff, Texas, Nullification and disunion— Evening not idle. "

Sun rose 6.14. behazed Set 5.17. beclouded  I received my manuscript of the Address, from the Atlas Office, but its publication in pamphlet form is yet problematical.— I have revised the errors of the publication in the Atlas, and have made up 20 copies and distributed them among several individuals my friends in several quarters of the Union— I shall soon be called to reply—to furious assaults from the worthies, whose characters and exploits I have brought in relief before the civilized world.— My main object now is the address to my Constituents to be delivered on the 30th. of this month—but in the review of the proceedings at the last Session of Congress I must make a selection of the topics which I am to discuss.— They are, 1. The choice of a Speaker whose election was contested. 2. The prostration of the Law prescribing elections by single districts. 3. The exclusion from the Journals of the protest against the subversion of the Law. 4. The abortive effort to discard the gag rule which I am yet discussing. Then come the Massachusetts Resolutions and the proceedings of the House upon them— The bill to refund Jackson’s fine— The threatened repeal of the Tariff of 1842.— The Oregon fever.— The Texas fever and Treaty— The Treaty with the German Customs Union, and the complicated intrigues and cabaling for the annexation of Texas; with the three Baltimore Conventions— The whig nomination of Henry Clay, and Theodore Frelinghuysen— The mock democratic nomination of John Tyler without a Vice President— The smuggled nomination of James K. Polk, and George M. Dallas— The political contortions of John C. Calhoun, and the disunion schemes of R. Barnwell Rhett and Langdon Cheves, all form a compound subject for discoursing to my Constituents. Of all these I must make a selection of which the Slave representation may be the common bond— A large portion of my time this day was consumed in a revolutionary Letter of Langdon Cheves. There is an almost insuperable difficulty in my way, that I cannot discuss these matters without bearing upon the Presidential canvas— Mr Beale and his two daughters spent the Evening here— It was my only interruption, yet I was up till 11. at Night.— I received the first and second number of a new weekly Newspaper, published at Boston called the Plain Dealer—professing Democracy, but striking at the prominent Men of all parties—except Thomas H. Benton. "

The pressure upon my brain increases and my time becomes so totally absorbed in writing that I have now Memory for scarcely any thing that passes from day to day. This day, besides the journal of yesterday I wrote four pages of my task, an atchievement which I shall probably never again perform. Mr G. W. Bryant came from North Bridgewater, and invited me to go and address a meeting of the people there— He said the Liberty party were making very great exertions there, and were speciall working for a concert with the Democracy; and they were detaching so many from the whigs, that they were apprehensive of losing the election of their candidate to represent the town in the State Legislature— I told him that I had promised to address the people of the 8th. Congressional District on the 30th. of this Month— I had left it to the whig Committee of the District to fix upon the place where the Address should be delivered, and I understood they had agreed upon Weymouth landing.— But I could divide my address in two, and deliver part of it at one place and part at another, and if he would see Mr Francis Hilliard of Roxbury, Mr Brigham of this town, Minott Thayer of Braintree or Thomas Loring of Hingham, and could make an arrangement with them, I would go to North-Bridgwater at any one or two days before or after the meeting at Weymouth landing. Doctor Nathaniel Miller of Franklin, came also to enquire if I could not visit that town or that part of the County, where he said the Liberty party were extremely busy and courting favour with the Democracy— He made some enquiries about the deputation from that party which visited me, and particularly about M. M. Fisher of Medway. At their convention at Dedham there were 55 votes taken of which there were 36. for Appleton Howe 14 for me, and 5 for this Mr Fisher. Their Presidential Candidate James G. Birney has come to Boston to electioneer for himself— He has been nominated by a Convention of Democrats at Saginaw in the State of Michigan, as a member of the State Legislature, and is throwing off his mask, and still trying to hide his face behind it— This coalition secretly concerted and just now coming out in its true colours will certainly break down the election in this 8th. District for the next Congress. I hope I may not take it too much at heart, but that it will prepare me for retirement for the rest of my days. "

Warm rain with a furious storm of wind all last night and continued all the morning of this day.— I still drudge without seeing when I can come to a close— I received this morning a Letter from John P. Kennedy of Baltimore, thanking me for my exposure of that infamous fraud concocted by Andrew Jackson, George W. Erving, Aaron Vail Brown, and Charles J. Ingersoll, with the two Lewises and other understrappers, for the destruction of my character; and to accomplish the annexation of Texas and a fourth part of Mexico to the United States. But he gives me warning that I shall have the whole swarm of hornets upon me; and I must make up my mind to meet them— In the progress of my address to my Constituents I am now coming to the encounter with the deepest, the cunningest and the foulest rascal of them all— With the bold dashing utterly base and baseless lies of Andrew Jackson, I shall have not much trouble, and no danger but of assassination not by him, but by one or another of his blood-hounds. With George W. Erving, I shall have easy work if I can get hold of him; for his revelations have not yet been made public, and I only know that the Statements drawn from them by Jackson, Brown and Ingersoll are all equally false— Brown’s Note, upon Jackson’s Letter is of itself enough to demolish him—he can never get over it.— Ingersoll’s falsehoods, are more cautiously covered and more dexterously combined— There is cunning as well as impudence in his publishing his report as the report of the Committee of foreign Affairs, although they rejected it— The mountebank mock solemnity with which he announces the revelations of George W. Erving to Jackson, may not perhaps be so easy to turn into ridicule, nor will it be so light a task to unravel his web of sophistry and chicanery, woven from Ervings sleezy threads, as to unty the coarse and clumsy knots of Jackson and Brown— To an impartial jury I should have but a plain tale to tell and the whole fabrick of knavery would fall to pieces—but with prejudice, faction, false popularity and unbridled profligacy, what will be the event?— The odds are fearful— May God defend the right— This afternoon Walter Hellen went into Boston with My Granddaughter Mary Louisa— She remained there at my Son’s house. He returned early in the Evening— Mrs De Windt came in this Evening from her residence at Fishkill landing. She comes alone to visit her unfortunate Son, John who is at Dr Bell’s at Charlestown— Her daughter Anna Maria is at Brattleborough—Vermont.— Sore afflictions. "

A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first and said, Son, go work to-day in my vineyard. 29. He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. 30. And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir, and went not. 31. Whether of them twain did the will of his father— They say unto him the first”— The discourse was a comme̅n̅y upon the whole parable, and one of the most pleasing Sermons I ever heard from Mr Lunt— He dissected the whole story—filled up the outline of the contrasted character of the two Sons—delineated the characters of two others, who might be of the same family— The one who upon being commanded by his father to go, work upon his vineyard, should answer at once I go, and should actually go—the best of the family—and the worst who should on receiving the command, should refuse obedience and act accordingly— He remarked upon almost every separate word of the narrative. Go Work—expatiated on the Nature of the command to work—active and useful industry—to day not waiting till to-morrow—and he closed with an Arabian Apologue about Bén Hassan to whom a Genius came and called him up to do some act of diligence, but who pleaded for indulgence from day to day, till Death came in the place of the Genius and would listen to no delay.— Mr Lunt occasionally digressed from the parable to the context and remarked upon the manner in which he avoided answering the question by what authority he performed his miracles—retorting upon them by a question whether they think the baptism of John from Heaven or of men? and when they answer they cannot tell he rejoins neither tell I you by what authority I act, not saying as they did that he cannot tell, but predicating his refusal upon their pretence of inability— Mrs De Windt left us this afternoon, and went to Mr John Angiers at Medford. She had come from Albany last Thursday, to Mr George T. Bigelow’s at Boston, and came out last evening with Mr and Mrs Bigelow from Boston.— Mr Lunts afternoon Sermon was from 1. John 3.7. [“]Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous”—that is as Christ the Son of God is righteous— The doctrine is that all righteousness consists of deeds and not of words— The Acadia Steamer arrived from Liverpool this afternoon at 4. O’Clock at Boston— At 2 and at half past 3 I had looked for her from the hill, but did not see her. "

Mr Bryant, the chairman of the whig club at North Bridgewater came again, and I agreed with him to go there and address the People at ten O’Clock in the morning, rain, snow or shine on Wednesday the 6th. of next Month— I am to go to Bennet’s Hotel, and must be there by 9 in the morning— While he was here, Mr C. C. P. Waterman of Sandwich on Cape Cod came with an invitation from Zenas R. Hinckley and five others a Committee of the whigs of that Town, to meet and address them, when it will best suit my convenience— I was obliged to decline this, having undertaken already more than I fear I shall be able to perform—that is to address my Constituents twice at two different places before I go to Washington, and before the approaching election— I have also received written invitations from W. D. Ely Corresponding Secretary of the Young Men’s Institute at Hartford Connt. to open a course of Lectures for the Winter for them there; in a Letter of 8 October transmitted to me with one of 17. October, from Boston, from John P. Putnam— From H. S. M’Call, Chairman of the Lecture Committee of the Young Mens Association at Albany to address them on my way to Washington, about the middle of November.— From Charles A. Stetson, and four others, who have resolved upon a public celebration in aid of the funds of the Washington Monument Association in New-York on the 25th. of November next— They say the occasion will be one of peculiar interest and my presence and participation in the ceremonies are earnestly and respectfully solicited— These with multitudes of others, of little comparative interest remain unanswered. An old Clergyman from Providence, by the name of Thomas Williams, who has been here before came with a young man, named Jonas Reynolds Perkins a son of the Minister at the Weymouth Landing, a graduate three years since of Brown University, and now a student at Law, with Mr Coffin of New Bedford, and had a long conversation with me upon speculative politics and religion. I deposited at the stone Bank an order of my Son upon the Merchant’s Bank—Boston, for 500 dollars, and drew 200 which I gave to my wife for her journey to Washington, and 100 for my current expenses here. I called at the Aurora Office and asked Mr Clapp if he proposed to publish my Address to the young Men’s whig club at Boston— He said he would, and I promised him a revised copy, from the Boston Atlas— My Son came out from Boston with Mary-Louisa but returned almost immediately to Boston, himself— My wife had intended to take her departure for Washington this day, but was deterred by the prospect of foul weather and postponed her journey till to-morrow— "

In my Address to the young Men’s whig club at Boston, I alluded to an incident in the Roman History merely from Memory, and in my extreme hurry I hazarded it, without verifying it by recurrence to Rollin or Livy— After the delivery of the discourse, I have felt a desire to verify my recollection of the facts and asked Walter Hellen and Mary-Louisa, to look it up in Rollin— I found it myself this morning, first in Rollin, and afterwards in Livy, 3.71— The event occurred in the 309th. year ab urbe condita—at the close of a war with the AEqui and Volsci— The dispute was between the Ardeates and Aricini and the people were wheedled into the judgment by an old soldier 83 years of age named Scaptius who started up in the Assembly of the people and declared that he would not suffer his country to be cheated out of her property— That he himself had fought in the battle when that same territory was taken, and would not without remonstrance see it taken away. The People and their Tribunes took fire— The Consuls and Senators struggled in vain to shame them out of their self-degradation in adjudicating the territory to themselves— Scaptius and the tribunes prevailed and the territory was re-annexed— This consultation of Livy was a temptation to dally with Time, to commune with him further but I broke away from him and wrote four pages of my proposed address, besides the journal of yesterday— I took nevertheless to Mr Clapp the publisher of the Quincy Aurora, the Boston Atlas of the 9th. with the errors of the press in my address to the young men’s whig club at Boston— He said he would publish it in two papers commencing next week, and would send me proof sheets to revise before the publication— My wife postponed again her departure for Washington till to-morrow— But she went this afternoon with Mrs John Adams, Mary-Louisa, and Walter Hellen into Boston, and took tea at my Son’s, with his wife.— He himself was dining at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s, with Mr. Daniel D. Barnard of Albany, who came to Boston to deliver a Lecture before the Boston Lyceum and an Address to the young men’s whig club; which last took place last evening. The party got back this evening about 9. O’Clock. While they were gone Mr and Mrs. Goodrich (he the author of Peter Parley[)] came and took tea with us. He afterwards delivered a political address to the whigs of Quincy at the town Hall, which for want of time I did not attend. "

He rose, as near as I can estimate 10 minutes before 5.— The morning was very chilly. The Sun rose perfectly clear and his Southern strides are now visible from one day to another— The pressure upon my time and nerves is indescribable. Mr S. T. Armstrong has been one of the truest friends that I have met with in this world.— He came out from Boston this morning to invite me to dine with him which I engaged to do, this day fortnight the 7th. of November— He was present and heard my address to the young men’s whig club at Boston. He retains more of any discourse of mine that he hears than any other person. He told me this day that he had never before heard that the value of amber was increased by the preservation of insects in it— I found the fact stated in Rees’s Encyclopaedia— This afternoon Miss Catherine Thaxter called here with a cousin of hers, apparently of a later generation whom she introduced as Miss Susan Thaxter.— Catherine spoke of my father and mother, and said she was here at the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage—which was of course the 25th. of October 1814. and she well remembered hearing my father say then to my mother that he loved her as dearly as he did on the wedding day.— The Revd. Jonas Perkins minister of the Church in Braintree at the Weymouth landing called towards evening— There is the place where on the 17th. of September 1842 I addressed my Constituents of the then 10th. District and there is the place where I am to address next Wednesday my Constituents of the present 8th. District— As the performance is to be introduced by a religious invocation, Mr Perkins asked me, if I should have any objection to that solemnity’s being performed by Mr Thomas Williams of Providence, who was here a few days since. I said none, if it would be agreeable to Mr Perkins himself.— He said Mr Williams had expressed to him his wish to officiate and he was willing to gratify him— I requested Mr Perkins if he should on his way home pass by Mr Minott Thayer’s house, to call on him, and say to him that I was grateful to him for his kind invitation to dinner on that day, but that I shall be obliged to return home to dine—and that I begged him not to be at any expence for entertaining any company on that day— My feelings are very different at the prospect of this meeting, from what they were on that occasion— All is now gloomy and discouraging, with a double opposition before me, and all but a certainty of failing to carry the election.

Briggs, inviting me to deliver a Lecture at the opening of the Lyceum in Roxbury two or three weeks hence— I have not time even to answer the invitation, and have numbers of unanswered invitations before me— But I wrote this day the journal of yesterday, and four pages of the address for next Wednesday at Braintree. This hurried composition however has so pernicious effect upon the style, that my heart sinks within me at the thought of what I am going to deliver, and my only hope is in striking about half of what I have written. About half an hour before dinner I took a walk round the garden, nursery and Orchard, looking into the seminary— The desolation of the Season cast a gloom on my spirits— The fruit has been gathered from all the trees except one bearing Quince tree on the borders of the pond— The ground is strewed with sere red and yellow leaves—the ground is wet and gathered in clods— Kirke has taken up a number of my seedlings and cut down others— Most of the large trees are mere stems, stripd of all their leaves— I hastened in from this prospect to dinner— I afterwards met in the garden Mrs Green the daughter of Mr and Mrs Kirk, wife of John A. Green editor of the Quincy Patriot— I had not seen her since her marriage, and did not at first know her— Again as the Sun went down, I walked up the Hill to Charles’s house to see the Sun set. But although it was not quite 5. O’Clock the Sun was already behind Mount Ararat.— I went further over the hill and surveyed the village, the surrounding country; the harbour and bay of Boston. The State house of Boston itself and the shaft of the Bunker-hill Monument; and Memory returned to the fact that this day 80 years ago, my father and mother were united in marriage— What an ordo seculorum commenced for me from that day. What was then the condition of the People who then constituted the town of Braintree— What is the condition of the People of the three towns of Quincy, Braintree and Randolph now? And what will be the condition of the occupiers of the soil of these three towns in 80 years from this day? The recollection of the past is pleasing and melancholy— The prospect of the future— Oh! how gloomy it is! Not a soul now lives, who was then in the bloom of life— Not a soul now living will be here in 1924.— My own term—how soon it will close! And to whom will all this belong in 80 years from this day? Will prayer to God preserve the branches and shoots from my father’s Stock What a phantasmagoria is human life! "

                "text": "26. IV. Saturday  Sun rose 6.24. Set 5.4. behind Mount Ararat.  Mr Loring was here this morning alarmed at the double opposition of the democracy and the Liberty party, each playing into the other’s hands to defeat my election—each holding up an ex-Senator from the County of Norfolk in the State Legislature against me; neither expecting to elect their own candidate, but purposely combining to exclude me— I have no doubt of their success, and only ask to meet the exigency with a proper spirit. Leavitt in the morning Chronicle, hints that the object of the Liberty party in defeating my election is to force me upon the Legislature as a candidate for the Senate and then to give a chance for Appleton Howe’s election as the member for the District.— The electioneering of the Liberty party from Birney their head down—is more knavish than that of either of the others— Mr John Belcher of Randolph came and said he was deputed by the whigs of that place to invite me to visit and address them; which I told him, would much to my regret be impossible— He said they had no hopes of carrying a majority for me in that town but would do, what they could— Mrs John Angier of Medford, and Mrs Susan Boyd with her infant daughter Anna were here— Mrs Angier spoke to me of her deposit in the Life Insurance Company the annual income from which she had requested three or four years ago might be left to accumulate, she now desires to receive all the interest that has accumulated and whatever may hereafter accrue from year to year— Mrs Angier has an extraordinary taste for painting and I saw on Wednesday last at my Sons house a beautiful head of a child in water colours painted by her— I had received a pretty Letter this morning from Charles’s daughter Louisa Catherine, urging me to go into Boston and spend as much of next week there as I can, as she is going next Saturday to Mrs Sedgwick’s school at Lenox and will probably not see me again for a year or more— She was to come out with her father this morning but was unwell and did not come— He came out with his two sons Charles and Henry; dined with us and returned to Boston— I had visits this afternoon from Edward Brooks and Thomas W. Phillips a son of my old friend John Phillips and a brother of Wendell Phillips. I finished this morning my proposed address to my Constituents and am so exceedingly disgusted with it that I made an attempt to begin anew with an introduction which may touch the interests of my hearers themselves.

                "text": "27. V. Sunday  I was somewhat disturbed in the Night, and not a little disordered through the course of this day. Mr Lunt had told me that he should preach at home this day but he exchanged with Mr Stearns of Hingham. The morning text was from Matthew 18.14. [“]Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish”— The Sermon had obviously been composed by way of consolation to some person who has lost a child. Jonathan Bass had a note up for the loss of a grand child; and the father and mother one for the loss of their child. I suppose the discourse was adapted to this occasion and perhaps may administer comfort to some persons.— But Rachel refused to be comforted for her children because they were not.— This eighteenth chapter of Matthew is a fruitful field of meditation. It begins by stating that after the transfiguration, Jesus being at Capernaum, and having performed a miracle to procure money to pay tribute for himself and for Peter, the disciples came and asked him who should be greatest in the kingdom of heaven— Was there not some connection between his paying the tribute and that question—and surely there was a rebuke in his answer.— He told them that they who made themselves like little children would be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and that no others would be admitted there.— Then he gave them that mysterious charge if any of their own members offended them to cast them off, and proceeds to say that it is not the will of their heavenly father that any one of the little ones should perish— Other injunctions of infinite importance follow, and the parable of the two debtors— Mr Stearns stopped at the promise to little children that none of them shall perish. He argued that they come into the world for a wise and benevolent purpose—that they afford comfort to their parents while they live, and that however prematurely taken away they leave to those whose affections they have engaged here the hope of meeting them in bliss hereafter.— The contemplation is sad and we can come after all to no other conclusion than resignation and submission to the will of heaven. Mr Stearns dined with Louisa C. Smith and me, and preached in the afternoon from John 13.34. “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.” Love is the essence of Christianity—but the love enjoined by this precept is not precisely the same with that commanded for the neighbour.— Love is a song of degrees— Parental filial conjugal love, friendship, gratitude, veneration, compassion are all diversified forms of one benevolent impulse of the heart, which the Christian must cherish and regulate.

No rain yesterday—not much last Night or this day but an occasional drizzling mist, and a heavy North-eastern gale through both days. I am still disordered and was up twice last Night. Mr Charles Clapp, editor of the Quincy Aurora brought me this morning a proof page of his next Thursday’s paper, containing about half of my address to the Boston young men’s whig club reprinted from the Atlas Newspaper, with my revisal— I examined it without discovering any error in it— There are several errors in the Atlas copy—among which the substitution of the word vaccination for buccination which is ridiculous; and the more provoking as buccination was a word of my own coinage, which I ventured for its peculiar point in the application—for the sake of the walk a took back to Mr Clapp his proof page— Of the Letters that I received this day there was one from Abbott Lawrence, enclosing two to him from David S. Brown, and Charles W. Churchman, both of Philadelphia— Brown is a Quaker; both dated the 24th. stating that Daniel L. Miller junr. a respectable young Quaker and abolitionist would write me that same day a Letter of enquiries about Polk and Clay and Texas, and intreating Mr Lawrence to urge me to answer Miller’s enquiries, because many Quaker and abolition votes would depend upon my answer.— By the same mail there came to myself a Letter from Joseph R. Chandler, Charles Gibbons President of the National Clay Club, A. J. Lewis, Nathan Sargent, and Charles W. Churchman notifying me of this Letter of enquiries from Daniel L. Miller junr and urging me to answer it— Then two Letters from Miller both of the same date, one giving me notice of the other which contains three questions for my opinion— 1. Whether the Election of H. Clay would defeat the Texas-annexation.— 2. Whether the election of Polk would ensure it? 3. Whether the annexation of Texas would advance or retard the abolition of Slavery? I wrote a joking answer but know not how he will take it— I could not with propriety write any other— It is curious how the Polecat rascals work upon the Quakers, and to what base uses electioneering is turned— All the rest of this day, and until 11. at Night I was writing upon my address for next Wednesday— I want another week to finish it as a new draft— It will now be a thing of shreds and patches of which I am heart-sick.

Towards Sunset the storm subsided The Northeastern gale gradually sunk to a calm— A soft, damp, clammy state of the atmosphere succeeded still covered with murky clouds till as the Night darkened the stars of the western horizon first appeared, and before I retired to bed at 11. P.M. the sky was clear and waning moon was bright— What small incidents cheer or depress the Spirits! I was fretting all day with the terror of a similar day to morrow, and to the prospect of having to go tomorrow to Braintree through floods of rain, and then to deliver the address to empty walls— The brightening sky as I closed the writing of my address was delicious— A promise of a fair day to morrow; and I found upon a review, that the new introductory written since I finished the first draught last Saturday, with the last half of the first draught, would make a sufficiently well compacted discourse for a delivery of two full hours and I was at my ease.— But nothing less than the incessant toil of writing from the day after I addressed the young whigs of Boston could have produced this result. Though often called to extemporize I never do it with any satisfaction to myself— This morning as the floods of rain were falling a young man named Seymour, came on horseback from Boston, where he had arrived, by the night passage from New-York— He brought me a Letter from J. R. S. Van Vleet, Chairman of the Committee of arrangements of the whigs of New-York, who are to have another great procession of trades to-morrow among which will be the Printers; and they want me to write a short address to the People which they may print with my name, while they are moving— I told this young man it was impossible, being engaged day and Night in preparing an Address to be delivered to the People of my own district, to-morrow— He asked for a written answer, but I thought a verbal one sufficient.— The poor young man said he was very unwell and had not slept last Night— I pitied him— Mr Thomas Tileston came with his brother James, to ask the Manuscript of my address of tomorrow to print in the Courier with which he is connected— I told him it was engaged to the Atlas— He then spoke for the Address to be delivered at North Bridgwater next week, which I promised.

My Son had left a Letter signed by Mr. Nathaniel Curtis and himself as Executors and Trustees of Ward Nicholas Boylston, to the Selectmen of Princeton, proposing an amicable chancery suit in the Supreme Court of the State, to ascertain the right of the town, and the duty of the Executors, concerning a bequest, which was to take effect after the decease of Mrs. Alicia Boylston— I signed the Letter and it was sent this morning. Also an answer to my wife’s Letter of last Saturday from Baltimore. This morning before breakfast I brought up my diary, and then gave the day to visitation of my friends— I gave my Granddaughter Louisa-Catherine, the breast pin I had purchased for her yesterday— I called on Mitchell the engraver with the signet ring I purchased for her yesterday, and gave an order to engrave the Lion crest and the initial A. on the Cornelian stone— At Dr. George Parkman’s former residence I found he had removed to N. 1. Joy place, Belknap Street— I visited at the houses of H. G. Otis, Edward Brooks, Robert C. Winthrop and John Davis, and found no one of them at home. I had found Joseph Hall, 83 years old verging upon the very last stage of life, with his Sister not so old but as decayed, a melancholy contemplation of human life; but still he received me with a warm welcome. I was going to Dr. Frothingham’s when I met his wife in the Street who told me he was at New-York, and she expect him to return to-morrow. at Mr James H. Foster’s I saw his wife and daughter Elizabeth— I had met their daughters Mary and Louisa at Dr Frothingham’s door— I met also President Quincy in the Street, and first mentioned to him the idea of having short Memoirs of the Lives of the persons, whose Portraits are at the historical Society, with an engraving of one of the Portraits published in every future volume of the Society— I was ten minutes at my Son’s office where I saw Mr. A. C. Spooner. Found Mr Abbott Lawrence at home, and spent half an hour with him and Mrs and Miss Lawrence. Dined at Charles’s. Louisa C. Smith also dined there. After dinner I called at Dr. George Parkman’s, and passed an hour with him Mrs Parkman and their Son— About 7 this Evening my Son returned home from his political excursion to Ashburnham, Ashby, and Winchenden. I received in the course of the evening successively five columns from the Atlas office, from 7. to 11. O’Clock after I was in bed, of proof of my address at Braintree— There was still a column left, which I sent them word to publish without waiting for my revisal. "

I looked in vain for her therefore in crossing the hill going to and returning from meeting— Mr Lunt preached this morning from 2. Timothy 1.7. [“]For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind”— This Epistle was written from Rome it is said when Paul was brought before Nero the second time— It was certainly very shortly before his martyrdom.— It is evidently written under great distress—in prison, abandoned by almost all his associates, some of whom he names, particularly those from Asia, his tone of complaint is not boisterous, nor pusillanimous but moderate, calm, without invective, and firm, specially exhorting Timothy to stand firm in the discharge of his duties, reminding him that the cause for which he suffers, is the purpose and grace of God “given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality through the gospel:”— This is the cause with regard to which he says God hath not given us the spirit of Fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Mr Lunt as is his usual practice analyzed the words of his text and contrasted the Spirit of Fear, with that of the three others named in the text—Power, Love and a sound mind. His description of Fear was almost as graphic as that of Collins in his Ode on the Passions; and he specially noticed the opposition in which it is placed by the Apostle to a sound mind— He observed that a sound mind never admitted Fear— That the passion always disordered the mind, and disabled it for the exercise of its regular functions.— The fear of God itself he said was so qualified by the Spirit of Love, that it lost its evil qualities; but that simple Fear, was of all human qualities that most selfish and base— The closing exhortation to the auditory, to banish the Spirit of Fear, and adhere to those of Power and Love, and a sound mind, was spirited and acceptable.— In the afternoon some what unexpectedly Mr Francis Cunningham a Classmate of my Son appeared in the pulpit and preached from Ecclesiasticus 33.15. [“]So look upon all the works of the most high: and there are two and two, one against another.” There is much wisdom in the Book of Jesus the son of Sirach, but it is not in good taste for a protestant divine to take a text from it for a Sermon; and the Sermon itself was not equal to Mr Lunt’s— Mr Cunningham was a very promising youth— His maturity proves a disappointment.

Smith of Boston personally appeared before him, and in his presence on oath declared that John Stocker Freeman, who had signed his name at the foot of the certificate, was to her certain knowledge the son of Thomas and Mary-Anne Freeman of Leominster in the County Hereford England, and formerly resident of Boston where the said John Stocker Freeman was born on the 23d day of September 1821.— The Deponent was uncertain whether the said Thomas Freeman were still alive or not but farther stated that the said Mary Ann Freeman (otherwise Mary Ann Collins[)] his wife, died in Boston in the month of March A.D 1823. The Letters to the Sister and to Mr Everett are well written, and the signature of the young man to the certificate is in a good hand. I promised to enclose these papers to Mr Everett, and would recommend the enquiries to his special attention— This was the only interruption of this day but I received from Nashville, Tennessee a Newspaper, containing Andrew Jackson’s first Answer to my address to the young men of Boston.— He is in great fury, but totally abandons the charge of the Erwin Treaty— I had been all the morning commenting upon James K. Polk’s Letter declaring his opinion in favour of the immediate annexation of Texas in which he assails me directly by name— And the remainder of the day and evening till 11 at night I was absorbed in writing a reply to Jackson’s letter to Robert Armstrong— The paper was enclosed to me by Boyd M’Nairy— Jackson denies positively that he ever advised the acceptance of the Sabine for the western boundary. Whether he equivocates upon the word advised, or has totally forgotten his interviews with me of 2. and 3. February 1819. The memory of violent men, is always the slave of their passions.— Jackson pledges himself to answer my charge further as soon as he can procure the Erving Manuscripts from Washington— "

I understood the meaning of the guns fired last night, on receipt of the election returns, from the western Counties of New-York, by the train of Cars from Albany. They settle the Presidential election, and James K. Polk of Tennessee is to be President of the United States for four years from the 4th of March 1845— What the further events of this issue may be—but it will be the signal for my retirement from public life— It is the victory of the Slavery element in the Constitution of the United States. Providence I trust intends it for wise purposes and will direct it to good ends— From the sphere of public action, I must at all events very soon be removed.— My removal now is but a few days in advance of the doom of Nature, and gives me time if I have energy to improve it, which will not be lost. I called this morning on Doctor Frothingham;—and just before reaching his door, met Mrs Isaac P. Davis who accosted me with grievous lamentation over the lost hopes of the election.— With Dr. Frothingham I examined and we construed the whole 16th. Elegy, of the second book of Properties—and we found that there is extant in English a translation in verse of this author, published in 1782. without the name of the translator— I called on judge Davis who condoled with me on the loss of the Presidential election; and also that in the list of stars in Rees’s Encyclopaedia Canopus is omitted— The judge thinks also that in Professor Williams’s account of their expedition to Penobscot to observe the transitthe star which they saw, and which he calls lucida Lyrae was in truth Arcturus— Immediately after dinner at 1/2 past 3. my Son left us to go by the railway cars to Haverhill to address a convocation of whigs there this Evening. I called at Libbey the jeweller’s shop with tufts of hair of Charles and his wife to be wrought into the signet Seal that I have procured for my wife. Mrs Gorham Brooks and Miss Henshaw visited Mrs Charles this afternoon; and Mr Brimmer the Mayor visited me this Evening. As I was passing by Dr. George Parkman came out from his house and walked with me home— Mr Tileston brought me proof Columns from the Courier Office of my North Bridgwater Address, and I passed the Evening with Mrs Charles in correcting it— There was another Cannonade this Evening for the Polk victory in New-York— Whig meeting this Evening at Faneuil Hall—and Daniel Webster’s Native American Speech.

Merely to gratify his curiosity— We conversed about half an hour, upon indifferent topics—but no politics— I recovered the arrears of my journals, and answered an invitation to dinner from Mr David Sears for next Thursday. Accepted. But I can have no tranquility in the city in the daytime. My address at North-Bridgwater was published in the Boston Courier of this morning. On examining it, I found a considerable number of errors of the press.— I read it over, and corrected as many of them as I perceived without finishing I went out—called at Libby the jeweller’s shop, and took the signet ring which I have procured for my wife, under the seal of which is intertwined the hair of my son and his wife. The seal is the lion crest bearing the cross and under it the initial A. Thence I went to the Office of the Courier; where I finished the revisal of my address, and bespoke fifty copies of it which were sent to me at my Son’s house— After dinner at 4. O’Clock, Benjamin came for me with the Carriage— Charles’s wife and Mrs Frothingham took a short ride of a quarter of an hour, and then I came out alone to Quincy, reached my house just at the dusk of evening— I sent the Carriage for Louisa C Smith at Mrs T. B. Adams’s, where she has been on a visit, since I left her here Thursday Morning. She returned in about half an hour; and I spent the Evening in folding up copies of my two addresses to my Constituents at Braintree and at North-Bridgwater, and in reflecting upon the duty that will now devolve upon me, to retire for the short remainder of my days from public life altogether— There are still duties enough to occupy the rest of my time, and to prepare me for my closing scene.

Merely to gratify his curiosity— We conversed about half an hour, upon indifferent topics—but no politics— I recovered the arrears of my journals, and answered an invitation to dinner from Mr David Sears for next Thursday. Accepted. But I can have no tranquility in the city in the daytime. My address at North-Bridgwater was published in the Boston Courier of this morning. On examining it, I found a considerable number of errors of the press.— I read it over, and corrected as many of them as I perceived without finishing I went out—called at Libby the jeweller’s shop, and took the signet ring which I have procured for my wife, under the seal of which is intertwined the hair of my son and his wife. The seal is the lion crest bearing the cross and under it the initial A. Thence I went to the Office of the Courier; where I finished the revisal of my address, and bespoke fifty copies of it which were sent to me at my Son’s house— After dinner at 4. O’Clock, Benjamin came for me with the Carriage— Charles’s wife and Mrs Frothingham took a short ride of a quarter of an hour, and then I came out alone to Quincy, reached my house just at the dusk of evening— I sent the Carriage for Louisa C Smith at Mrs T. B. Adams’s, where she has been on a visit, since I left her here Thursday Morning. She returned in about half an hour; and I spent the Evening in folding up copies of my two addresses to my Constituents at Braintree and at North-Bridgwater, and in reflecting upon the duty that will now devolve upon me, to retire for the short remainder of my days from public life altogether— There are still duties enough to occupy the rest of my time, and to prepare me for my closing scene.

I found he rose directly behind the belfry on the 21st.— I shall be gone this year before that day— Mr Lunt preached this morning from 1. Corinthians 6:20— “Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods.” The Chapter from which this text is a clause of the last verse begins with a very severe reproof of the Christians at Corinth for going to Law with one another, not before the Saints their fellow Christians— The apostle declares that the saints shall judge the world—and this principle assumed thus early, and perseveringly pursued was doubtless the cause of the absolute power exercised during so many centuries by the Pope as the head of the Christian church This peremptory injunction never to go to Law with one another before infidel judges, was an unhinging engine which disabled to the extent of its influence all the roman tribunals of their power over the Christian sectarians. The Apostle then proceeds to declare that no person addicted to vicious morals, of person, property or good name shall inherit the kingdom of God. He then passes to a special, solemn, and deeply impressive charge against the sin of fornication, reminding them that other sins are offensive externally to the sinner himself but that this is a sin against his own body— He says they are bought with a price— That each one of them is the Temple of the holy ghost within him; not his own, but the property of God himself— Therefore says he glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s— This is a doctrine of angelic purity— On returning from meeting I found Mr Degrand at my house who dined and spent the day and evening with us till 9. O’Clock He brought out sundry newspapers, all confirming the fact of the total loss of the Presidential election— Mr Lunts afternoon sermon was from Mark 14.8. “She hath done what she could.” a Melancholy allusion to the condition of the present times, and to the disastrous issue of the Presidential Election— For the first time he alluded to the dismal prospects before us to the cause of human liberty, and the rights of petition and of protection— And he exhorted all his hearers to enquire of themselves whether they have done what they could for their salvation and preservation— Mr E. Price Greenleaf promised to call and visit my nursery with me to-morrow, and Mr Beale came and joined in lamentations with us at the Catastrophe which has befallen us. "

Thunder and Lightening with a sprinkling of rain in the afternoon— Evening calm, moderate damp cloudy— It was the day of election for Electors of President, and Vice President of the United States— For Governor, Lieutenant-Governor Senators and Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and for members of the House of Representatives of the United States in the 29th. Congress.— For this last office I was the candidate nominated by the whigs, with two opponent nominationsWright of Roxbury by the Democrats, and Appleton Howe of Weymouth by the Liberty Party. I passed the day under a scarcely doubting anticipation of the failure of my own election— Mr Spear is the author of a Treatise against Capital Punishment, of which he brought me a copy for sale, which I took. He told me he was a Clergyman in Boston, but his name is not in the Register of the present year.— Mr Ellis and Mr Durfee were here after dinner Mr Ellis to speak about the claims of William Barron and Amasa Dunbar at Washington, and Mr Durfee, with a large Quarto Volume of Autograph signatures to which he desired the addition of mine with some lines.— He wished also some separate signatures on a sheet of blank paper and I gave him one, and several upon cards.— Mr Ball is a surgeon dentist, a young man, and he came with a large quarto Volume, for autographs—blank; and he wanted to begin the book with mine. Just before noon I went to the Stone Bank and settled my balance there, and then to the town house where I tore off my own name from the whig ticket and deposited the remainder of the ticket in the ballot box. I gave my own name which I had torn off to Harvey Field at his request— In the Evening E. Price Greenleaf came in with report of the election returns from the adjoining towns of Braintree, Randolph and Hingham—more favourable on the whole than I had expected; yet not enough so, wholly to resolve my doubts I wrote in the evening a Letter to Edward Everett to enclose those of J. S Freeman, and One to Erastus C. Benedict Secretary of the New-York Historical Society, accepting their invitation to attend their 40th. anniversary meeting on the 20th. I wasted no small portion of this day in searching for Andrew Jackson’s answers to my invitations to him to dine with me in January and March 1819. and found two of them. He denies having had any communication with me in 1819. "

Confined to the house all the morning by the rain, but without any thing more than the journal of yesterday and making up a file of Letters received within the last three weeks, and which I have not found time to answer, to file, and scarcely to read.— I have now four or five days of leisure—not sufficient to answer a tythe of the Letters which I ought to answer if I could. I did not finish the filing and endorsing of them— Mrs John Angier of Medford was here, and I agreed to go and pass the Evening at her house next Friday— At noon I called on Doctor N. L. Frothingham, and passed an hour with him examining his Propertius— Burman’s Edition— The best extant— My edition, Baskerville’s quarto has nothing but the text, and the passage quoted in in G. W. Erving’s Letter, is in the 20th. elegy of the second book—in Burman’s edition it is the 16th. But we found no explanation of the difference— The Doctor asked me what had so much excited the attention of my mind to this passage of Propertius? I told him it was the quotation of it in G. W. Erving’s Letter, and its whimsical connection of it with the Texas question, and with Erving’s base and treacherous treatment of me I called at Mr James H. Fosters and saw Mrs Foster, her daughter Mary and Louisa C. Smith— I told Miss Smith that I had promised to go to Medford on Friday, and must therefore postpone our return to Quincy till Saturday At the Boston Courier Office I asked the return of the three newspapers with marked passages cited and inserted in my Address at North-Bridgwater— They sent them to me this afternoon— I found myself after dinner, drowsy and went out again, purchased small toys for Charles’s four sons, and called at judge John Davis’s— He asked me to go with him this Evening to the Wednesday evening club of which I was a member in 1790. and again in 1802 and until 1809. It was this Evening at Dr Francis Parkman’s and I promised to go.— Returning home, I directed BenjaminAndrews to go at a quarter before eight with the Carriage and take up judge Davis in Milton place and come for me to Charles’s house which he did, and I spent the Evening with the Club at the Revd. Dr Francis Parkman’s— There were about 30 persons present—among whom five or six Strangers— At half past ten I took judge Davis home, and then returned to my Sons house. I found judge Davis exceedingly gratified with my notice of the founders of the Plymouth Colony in my Address at North-Bridgwater. "

Friday  Morning visits from Harrison Gray Otis, and George Alexander Otis, men between whom there is no community, but of name; with the former of whom I have been in relations of personal intimacy and political controversy little short of three score years— For many years he acted a conspicuous part on the theatre of public affairs, and led in an unfortunate career of policy our native Commonwealth of Massachusetts— The result was to arrest him in his career of ambition, and he never reached beyond the Station of Senator of the United States, which he voluntarily relinquished, to move in the more contracted sphere of Mayor of the City of Boston; from which he also after short experience retired to affluent retirement in private life. He is abundantly wealthy, and has raised a numerous family, only one of whom has ever ventured on the stormy sea of politics, and meeting with adverse gales and some slight disaster, regained the shore and has not attempted a second voyage.— The father takes no longer any part in politics but lives, crippled with the gout, but otherwise in comfort, and the enjoyment of all that this world can afford, with two sons, one married daughter and several grand-daughter, awaiting in his 80th year his transition to Mount Auburn— My acquaintance with George Alexander commenced as a fellow passenger from London to New-York in 1817. Without an early classical education He has devoted his life to the literature of translation, which he has had the good fortune to make profitable. His translation of Botta’s history was eminently successful, and his Tusculan of Cicero have not proved a failure. He has unpublished translations of the other philosophical works of Cicero, and of the Offices—and also of Davila’s Civil Wars of France— He sat with me upwards of an hour—kind—courteous and incredibly flattering— Mrs Grinnell paid a morning visit to Mrs. Charles— I took to Dr Frothingham the volume of Ernesti’s Cicero, Boston Edition, containing the Dedication to Stiglitz— Call at Charles’s Office— Nobody there— At Cadmus’s 220. Washington Street— Letter of the 12th. from my wife at Washington— Answered immediately— I answered also two Letters from William Jackson of Newton. At 5. P.M. I rode with my Son 7 miles to Medford to the new house of Mr John Angier, where we spent the Evening, with a party of about 70. friends, family acquaintance and neighbours of Mr and Mrs Angier— His mother and Mrs T. B. Adams were there. His brothers Luther and Joseph—two Misses Osgood &c— We left the company at half past 9. and reached N. 57. Mount Vernon Street at a quarter past ten— "

From the S.E. corner of Charles’s house, the Sun rose one full disk North of the Temple belfry which performed a complete transit over the disk in 7 minutes. when the whole disk was behind the pillars of the belfry, the temple clock struck seven— True to the Sun to a minute— Last evening a Professor Church, a frenchman notwithstanding his name, accompanied by Dr Clark, an Episcopal Clergyman from Northampton, came with an introductory Letter from Revd Samuel K. Lothrop.— Professor Church is a teacher of the French language, upon a plan of his own,—and he wished me to examine his plan and give him a certificate of my opinion of it.— I told him that I made it a general rule, never to give certificates; and that if I did ever give one I had now no time for the examination— Dr Clark comes out to perform divine service to-morrow at the episcopal church where there is at present no Rector—Mr Robinson having been dismissed. This day Mr Lunt preached in the Temple from Luke 17.21. [“]For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.” This was the answer of Jesus to the Pharisees who enquired when the kingdom of God should come? It was immediately after the miracle of cleansing of ten lepers, only one of whom returned to glorify God; and he a Samaritan— In the verse immediately preceding the text Jesus says the Kingdom of God cometh not with observation— That is heralded with the sound of a trumpet. Mr Lunt said it was a Revolution in the human character— That it was the reign of righteousness and truth upon earth— Oh! how far yet from its consummation— Mr Lunt’s afternoon discourse was from Philippians 4.5— “Let your moderation be known unto all men.”— He expatiated well upon the importance of this precept, as a lesson of Prudence.— It is not only moderation, but notorious universally known moderation— And yet how much more emphatic and solemn is the injunction, with the additional clause of the text, which Mr Lunt omitted—“The Lord is at hand” That your moderation should be known, is for your own benefit—propitiates the good will of others, and disarms enmity and malice— But the consideration that the Lord is at hand, reminds us our responsibility to God. It is the pure dictate of duty; and whether known to man or not cannot escape the notice of the Lord who is at hand— After Meeting I called and took leave of Mrs T. B. Adams and Elizabeth. Mrs Stebbins and John Foster— Visit from Mr and Mrs Cushing of Dorchester. "

I rose in time to finish my journal of yesterday, and to breakfast before half past seven O’Clock— Then took a hack to the depot of the Worcester Railroad, and took passage in the day line by the Long-Island-rail-road to New-York— My Son accompanied me to the Car, and took leave of me in it— As did also Mr James Savage— I found there Dr Codman, Mr Young and Mr Ellis, delegates, my associates from the Massachusetts historical Society to attend the anniversary celebration of the New-York historical Society, to-morrow. We started precisely at 5 minutes past 8 as I supposed for Providence; but it had been the coldest night of the Season, and all the windows of the car were closed, and dew obscured— At 10. O’Clock the Car stop’d and I was surprized to hear we were at Worcester— The stoppage was scarcely for five minutes—and we proceeded in the same cars to Norwich where we crossed over the bridge of the Quinepaug swelling into the Thames; a stupendous work—we followed the Southern bank of the river seven miles down, where the Steamer New-Haven was in waiting to receive us— We noticed as we passed along the region of the Pequod War, and the reserve upon which the remnant of the Mohegan tribe yet dwell 3000 acres, and about 70 Souls.— We passed down the river, stopping at New-London only time enough to take in passengers, and in two hours and a quarter, with a bright Sun a smooth Sea and a chilling Northwester; landed at Greenport a small village on Long-Island— Here we took again the cars, at 3. O’Clock having dined in the boat and at 7 in the Evening alighted at Brooklyn—95 miles in 4 hours— We immediately crossed the ferry, took a hack and at half past 7. found ourselves (Mr Young, with a young Lady Miss Toppan of New-Hampshire, Mr Ellis and myself[)] at Bunker’s hotel or boarding house in Broadway.— Exactly 12 hours from my Son’s house in Boston— Dr Codman stop’d at Brooklyn— On the road I had much conversation with sundry Strangers, but chiefly with Mr Ellis, Minister of a Congregational church and Society in Charlestown, and a writer of sundry Articles in Sparks’s American biography— He is intimately acquainted with the history of the Pequod War, of which he mentioned to me many incidents, and is also much interested in the controversies in which Mrs Hutcheson so largely figured.

I rose in time to finish my journal of yesterday, and to breakfast before half past seven O’Clock— Then took a hack to the depot of the Worcester Railroad, and took passage in the day line by the Long-Island-rail-road to New-York— My Son accompanied me to the Car, and took leave of me in it— As did also Mr James Savage— I found there Dr Codman, Mr Young and Mr Ellis, delegates, my associates from the Massachusetts historical Society to attend the anniversary celebration of the New-York historical Society, to-morrow. We started precisely at 5 minutes past 8 as I supposed for Providence; but it had been the coldest night of the Season, and all the windows of the car were closed, and dew obscured— At 10. O’Clock the Car stop’d and I was surprized to hear we were at Worcester— The stoppage was scarcely for five minutes—and we proceeded in the same cars to Norwich where we crossed over the bridge of the Quinepaug swelling into the Thames; a stupendous work—we followed the Southern bank of the river seven miles down, where the Steamer New-Haven was in waiting to receive us— We noticed as we passed along the region of the Pequod War, and the reserve upon which the remnant of the Mohegan tribe yet dwell 3000 acres, and about 70 Souls.— We passed down the river, stopping at New-London only time enough to take in passengers, and in two hours and a quarter, with a bright Sun a smooth Sea and a chilling Northwester; landed at Greenport a small village on Long-Island— Here we took again the cars, at 3. O’Clock having dined in the boat and at 7 in the Evening alighted at Brooklyn—95 miles in 4 hours— We immediately crossed the ferry, took a hack and at half past 7. found ourselves (Mr Young, with a young Lady Miss Toppan of New-Hampshire, Mr Ellis and myself[)] at Bunker’s hotel or boarding house in Broadway.— Exactly 12 hours from my Son’s house in Boston— Dr Codman stop’d at Brooklyn— On the road I had much conversation with sundry Strangers, but chiefly with Mr Ellis, Minister of a Congregational church and Society in Charlestown, and a writer of sundry Articles in Sparks’s American biography— He is intimately acquainted with the history of the Pequod War, of which he mentioned to me many incidents, and is also much interested in the controversies in which Mrs Hutcheson so largely figured.

The visitors were so numerous and the transactions of the day so various, that they left scarcely a distinct impression upon my mind of any thing— Professor Mason as chairman of the Committee of arrangements of the New-York historical Society came early and informed me of the arrangements for the day. A Committee of 5 members of the Society with Mr. W. Beach Lawrence, a Vice-President, came welcomed me to the city— An interlude of no small note was the friendly visit of Coll. Bankhead to apprize me that Mr Samuel L. Governeur, was in possession of a Letter from General Jackson, fully approving the Florida Treaty— We dined at Bunker’s at half-past 3. and at half past four Carriages from the Society came and took me with Dr John Codman, Revd. Alexander Young and Revd. George E. Ellis to the Astor-House, where we took up Mr Leverett Saltonstall, and proceeded to the Library room of the University where the Meeting of the historical Society was held, the President Albert Gallatin being in the Chair. The numbers of the Society are unlimited, and the only business done, was the admission by an open vote sundry members, nominated at a previous meeting; and the nomination of sundry others among whom was John Jacob Astor.— The assembly was quite numerous and thronged the spacious apartment.— They then joined in a procession of Carriages to the Church of the Messiah, of which Orville Dewey is the Pastor, where an Oration was delivered by John Romeyn Brodhead upon historical subject— He has been an agent of the State to collect documents relating to its history in England, France and Holland—of which agency he gave an interesting account; interspersed with several passages of beautiful eloquence— The house is large, and was well filled— The Discourse was preceded by a prayer by Revd Dr. De Witt of the reformed Dutch Church. The closing benediction was by Dr Codman.— From the Church between 8 and 9. O’Clock the Society adjourned to the New-York Hotel where a magnificent dinner was prepared for 300 persons— Mr Gallatin had not gone to the Church; but presided at the table for about an hour, and then retired before the speeches began. Mr William Beach Lawrence presided the remainder of the Evening.— Mr Luther Bradish late Lieutt. Governor of New-York toasted me, or roasted me with a speech so fulsome that it overset all my philosophy, and I stammered a reply the only palliation of which was its brevity— The speeches followed till sometime passed midnight when I retired with my colleagues Saltonstall, Young and Ellis. Mr Samuel L. Gouverneur promised to call on me to-morrow Morning at 8 O’Clock— "

He told me he was now employed by Mr John Jacob Astor as an Agent for carrying into execution his donation of four hundred thousand dollars to the City of New-York, for a library— Our arrival at Philadelphia last evening was delayed by an accident which befell the corresponding train of Cars going from Philadelphia to New-York— Between Princeton and Trenton their locomotive engine ran off the track and stuck in the mud— Their train barred the passage to ours, and we were obliged to change our seats and take others in the train from Philadelphia, to which the accident had happened— The train which we left was taken by the passengers from Philadelphia for whom another engine was procured, and baggage enough to load a ship was mutually transferred. The detention was of about two hours and a half; and professor Bartlett more than once reminded me of the melancholy disaster which befell the train of Cars, between Amboy and Bordentown in November 1833. when he and his wife and two infant daughters were fellow passengers.— He said his wife and daughters who were much injured by the accident had all entirely recovered from its effects— This morning Coll. and Mrs Talcott, and professor Bartlett proceeded on their journey and Mr Huntington was the only acquaintance left me in the house— Ebenezer Tucker of New-Jersey heretofore a member of Congress now 87 years of age, visited me in the course of the day, and Mr Meredith of Baltimore dined with us at the Lady’s Ordinary— I received of George Rundle, York Street 61. dollars a final dividend of the Schuylkill permanent bridge stock, and at the Bank of North-America Chesnut Street an order on the Bank of the Metropolis at Washington for 240 dollars for 8. Coupons of interest on Cincinnati bonds— In the evening I went to the Chesnut Street Theatre and saw the Hunchback, and the President incog. "

Rogers, the first person whom I knew, after leaving Jones’s Union Hotel in Philadelphia.— He walked with me, bewailing all the way the issue of the election and left me at Barnum’s door.— At the Lady’s Ordinary they were at table, and there I met Commodore Ballard and Mrs Ballard, with a little girl 8 or 9. years old their granddaughter— The Commodore welcomed me with great cordiality; told me that it was a constant satisfaction to him that I had signed his commission, and remembered as I did, that in May 1836, he had given up at 11. O’Clock at Night his own chamber at Barnum’s, to me for a lodging, when there was not another in the house to be had.— He then took for the Night a bed in the chamber of Commodore Alexander J. Dallas then a fellow lodger here, but recently deceased as commander of the squadron in the pacific. After dinner, I returned to the depot and took a seat in the train of Cars for Washington, which started at 5. O’Clock for Washington City. at the relay house 8. Miles from Baltimore, the termination of the Cumberland railroad, Mr John J. Crittenden a Senator of the United States from Kentucky, and Mrs Crittenden, and W. C. M’Causlen a member of the House from Ohio came into the Car, and arrived with us at Washington soon after 7. by the light of the moon, almost rivaling the noonday. From the depot at the foot of the Capitol hill I walked home, and had scarcely entered the house, when Dr Thomas followed me— Mrs John Adams was confined to her bed, and my dear wife, though not in bed is afflicted with one of those stubborn nervous coughs which seem to deny respite or relief.— And thus on reaching home, I am called to mingle with the notes of gratitude for continued blessings the supplication for further mercies— Mr Cutts and his daughter came in soon after and spent an hour of the Evening here— And after the visitors were gone, I mused over the prospects before me; with the impression that they portend trials more severe than I yet have passed through—and with a reliance alone on him who rules above.

                "text": "24. VI. Sunday—  My wife was quite ill great part of this day, but promisingly better this Evening.— I gave her this morning the signet ring which I purchased for her in Boston, upon the Cornelian stone of which Mitchell engraved the crest of the Lion bearing the cross, and under it the Letter A. with the hair of our Son Charles and his wife in a box under the stone— And I gave to my granddaughter Mary Louisa the signet ring which I procured for her, and on which Mitchell engraved the cock, with the motto “Watch”— And for the significancy of the device, at my request she read to me the 13th. chapter of Mark—the last verse of which is—And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch. I attended public worship this morning at the second presbyterian church, where Mr Knox preached from Luke 19.41. “And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it.”— There was something deeply saddening in this discourse. Jesus wept over the city because he foresaw and foretold the destruction of it which was so soon afterwards to ensue. Mr Knox remarked that there but two occasions in the life of Jesus, upon which it is recorded that he wept— This, and at the death of Lazarus before he restored him to life— That these tears were indications of the purest benevolence, and the most exquisite tenderness; all which is apparent— But the destruction of Jerusalem has no observable connection with their treatment of Jesus Christ. Judea was conquered by the Romans as other Nations were, and in the process of that conquest Jerusalem was taken and the second temple was destroyed— In foretelling this event Jesus affirms that if Jerusalem had repented and believed in him, she would not have suffered that dreadful fate; but the Judean war of Vespasian and Titus had no earthly connection with the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth. Mr Knox in the application of his discourse, put it, as an awful question to his hearers whether this city was not as guilty, and as deserving of the afflictive judgment of Heaven as Jerusalem was in the days of Jesus Christ; but he did not specify the sins which may draw down destruction upon it— Slavery is the great besetting sin of this city; but of that Mr Knox took no note— He complained that of 25 or 26 thousand inhabitants, not more than 3000 attended upon any religious exercises of public worship, a fact that seems incredible but otherwise the sins of this city are not more aggravated than those of the age in other populous cities, and that the vices of the age, and the sins of this Nation deserve a severe judgment of Heaven is too painfully true to be denied— May that judgment be averted, and the manners of the age and nation be reformed and purified. After dinner I attended at St. John’s church where Mr Hawley read the Evening service for the 25th. Sunday after Trinity, and Mr Slaughter a Clergyman from Virginia preached from John 7.17. [“]If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.”— Eclipse of the moon. "

                "text": "25. V:15. Monday.  I arrived here on Saturday Evening with a clear sky, bright moonlight, and the atmosphere of May rather than of November— Yesterday Morning it was yet warm; but the wind came round to the North-west and it was all day growing cold; and as I was returning from church last evening, between 5 and 6. O’Clock, I saw the moon just risen with the shadow of the earth already encroaching upon her disk— The eclipse was total and lasted upwards of three hours but the cold was so pinching that I could look at it only once or twice; and then less than five minutes at a time— This day has been of bright clear disqualifying cold— I unpacked my trunks, and immediately missed one or two articles, precisely those I wanted and left behind— It made a day of fruitless search and of wasted time. I walked out for exercise, and at the National Intelligencer Office saw Mr Gales in deep distress at the issue totally unexpected issue of the Presidential election— He is in despair and foresees that it must prove his irretrievable ruin. It has been accomplished by fraud through the Slave representation.— The partial associations of native americans, Irish catholics, abolition Societies, Liberty party.— The Pope of Rome, the Democracy of the sword, and the dotage of a ruffian, are sealing the fate of this Nation, which nothing less than the interposition of omnipotence can save. I asked Mr Gales to send me the Intelligencer, from the 14th. which he did, and I sent him the Boston Atlas of 2. Novr. and the Courier of 9. November containing my addresses at Braintree and at North Bridgwater which he had no read— After I came home, Mr Michael Nourse a ruling elder of the second Presbyterian Church called on me and enquired if I would consent to go as a delegate from that Church and Society, to the Sabbath day Convention to be held at Baltimore next Wednesday. I said I should feel honoured by the election, but doubted whether it would be in my power to go. The meeting of the Society was held at half past four this afternoon— I did not attend it but in the Evening the Revd. Mr Knox, and Mr Nourse came as a Committee from the Meeting to inform me that I had been elected a delegate from the Society to the Convention. I expressed my grateful sensibility for the honour conferred upon me, and promised to attend the Convention, if it should be in my power. I know not if this acceptance be prudent, but as an act of kindness to the Society and a testimony of respect for the Sabbath I believed it proper. "

IV:30 Tuesday  I found myself unexpectedly absorbed in business unforeseen— Received a multitude of Letters among which one from my son at Boston enclosing a Letter to my wife from her Sister Mrs Harriet Boyd with six draugts by her upon me and my son, one for eighty dollars being her portion of the surplus of the Estate of Thomas B. Johnson ordered by the judge of the orphan’s Court last July to be distributed among the heirs. Another for 197 dollars 78 Cents due to Mrs Boyd on her annuity the interest on 5000 dollars, Mr Johnson’s bequest to her. Then three draughts each for 60 dollars by anticipation payable 14 January, April and July 1845. and one payable 14 October 1845—for 197:78. For all these Mrs P Boyd imploringly calls for 300 dollars immediately, to save her and her family from being turned out of house and home by the forfeiture of the Estate on which they live— I wrote to Charles to remit to George Boyd a post note of the merchants Bank Boston to be sent under cover to me, to be forwarded by me to him in two separate halves for 500 dollars—taking on myself the responsibility of the future payments as they shall become payable My wife insisted that 300 dollars of her first years annuity from her brothers bequest which Charles has invested for her should be pledged for the payment of the sums, advanced on Mrs Boyd’s draughts— I sent for two Justices of the Peace who came, Mr Clarke and Mr King who came and witnessed and took the acknowledgment of myself and my wife to the Deed of my lands in Quincy taken by the Boston and old Colony Rail-road, the consideration for which is left in blank to be filled up. I received also from John G. Palfrey Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a Letter my credential as the representative of the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts in the 29th. Congress together with a list, of all the votes returned—upwards of 14000. I called at the National Intelligencer Office to ask for a paper of 28 September and to offer my whole file of duplicates; but neither Gales nor Seaton was there. At the Clerk’s Office of the House of Representatives but French was gone home to dinner. I found Mr Mehan in the library— My wife was so ill this Evening that I wrote to Revd. Mr Knox to excuse myself for not going to Baltimore to-morrow— But she was afterwards better and persuaded me to go. "

I breakfasted, and rode to the depot of the train of Cars for Baltimore— Met there the Revd Dr Laurie, and Mr Knox whom I informed that my wife being better I had concluded to come to Baltimore, and attend the Sabbath day convention At 6. we started and at a quarter past 8. alighted at the depot in Baltimore— I walke to Barnum’s Hotel, and bespoke a bed chamber. Met there Mr Chambers of Chambersburg and Harmar Denny of Pittsburg and Mr Newkirk of Philadelphia, and sundry others delegates to the Convention— At a quarter before 10 Mr Knox called for me, and I went with him to the first Baptist Church in Sharp Street which we found filled with about 1200 delegates to the National Lord’s day Convention— Mr Hanmer the Minister of the Church moved that judge Willard Hall of Delaware should be chairman of the meeting to organize the Convention which was voted by acclamation and he took the Chair. Two Secretaries were chosen and a Committee of 5. Bishop Waugh, Dr Bond, Mr Stilman, Mr Atwood, and Mr Gideon, were appointed to submit officers and rules for the government of the Convention— While they were out, Mr Powell of Philadelphia was requested to address the meeting which notwithstanding some objections he did— The Committee soon came in and reported John Quincy Adams, President—seven Vice Presidents 1. Willard Hall, 2. Theodore Frelinghuysen 3. Dr Nott. 4 Bishop Waugh 5. J. A. Brown, 6. H. V. D. Johns 7. J. Kingsford—and four Secretaries, Harmar Denny C. W. Ridgely, C. A. Davis, and T. Stilman, which nominations were approved by an unanimous vote— I took the Chair and made a very brief address to the Convention; and the Committee on Officers and rules made a supplementary report of 8 rules— The first of which was that the Convention should meet at 9. A.M—sit till 1 p.m. adjourn till 3. P.M adjourn at 5. and meet again at 7. P.M.— There was some discussion whether the question should be taken upon all the rules at once, or upon each rule separately—after some debate a motion was made to take one question upon all the rules, which was carried by a large majority and they were adopted with only two or three dissenting votes— There was much discussion about a roll call of the members, and after an attempt to read over the names which it was found would consume more time than the Convention could spare a committee of enrolment was appointed, to whom all members having credentials were authorised to present them and members having no credentials were to be accredited upon their own declaration— A Letter from T. Frelinghuysen was read regretting his inability to attend the convention, whereupon James Clarke was appointed 2d Vice President in his place— Bishop Waugh, Methodist read a Letter addressed to the Convention with enclosed papers, but a Committee had been appointed to report the business to be acted upon by the Convention; and a rule required that all communications addressed to the Convention should be referred to the business Committee— They reported seven Resolutions the first of which was a general one, avering the duty of all men to remember the Sabbath and keep it holy. This started a snarling debate Mr Lemmon, a delegate from Baltimore, and Mr Magruder of Virginia, who insisted that the Sabbath being an abrogated Jewish institution, in no wise binding upon Christians. This was in substance nothing more than an objection to the use of the word Sabbath, instead of the Lords day; but they misunderstood it as an infidel attempt to break up the Convention itself— Attempts were made to silence Mr Lemmon and Mr Magruder— They were repeatedly called to order; Magruder was loudly hissed, and there were numerous calls to turn him out. I maintained them both in their right to speak, until they were heard through— A motion was made to lay Mr Lemmon’s amendment on the table, and question made whether that motion was debatable. I decided that it was, there being no rule to the contrary— It was accordingly warmly debated till the time for adjournment, immediately before which the question was taken and Mr Lemmon’s amendment was laid on the table by an apparently unanimous vote. At 1. O’Clock the Convention adjourned till 3.— As we were retiring Mr Lemmon put into my hand a printed paper, headed, Report for the Lord’s day Convention— I had forgotten in packing up my valise, to put in it—a pen—which reminded me of La gageure imprévue. I stop’d at a shop, and purchased a paper of Camel steel pens.— At Barnum’s they had dinner at 1/2 past 2. I found myself seated by Lloyd N. Rogers, but was obliged to leave the table, dinner half over, to take the Chair of the Convention at 3.— The first and 7. other resolutions offered by the business Committee were now passed in quick succession by unanimous votes before Messrs. Lemmon and Magruder came in— The Convention adjourned from 5 to 7. and sat again from 7 to 10.— The house crowded to its utmost capacity. Adjourned to 9. to-morrow morning "

I could not comprize in one page the journal of yesterday, nor finish the account of the day before breakfast— My wife had charged me to procure for her two handsome picture frames for the portraits of her eldest sister, Nancy, the first Mrs Hellen and of herself painted by Savage, before they were married— I went accordingly to the shop of Mr Fryer in Gay Street— My wife had named him to me, and the bar-keeper at Barnum’s had assured me that his shop was the best shop for that Article in the City— I found and bespoke the two frames for 20 dollars and directed them to be sent to the depot of the rail-road Cars, boxed up—this afternoon or to-morrow morning as I should thereafter advise— Precisely at 9. O’Clock I took the Chair of the Convention, of whom very few members were present Bishop Waugh of the methodist episcopal church made the prayer kneeling— The Revd. Justin Edwards Chairman of the business Committee presented successively a number of resolutions all having reference to the observance of the Lord’s day; and three several addresses to the Canal Commissioners to the Directors of Railroads, and to the People of the United States, all of which were read and adopted by the Convention without debate— Sundry members of the Convention offered separate Resolutions, which were referred to the business committee, then reported by them with such modifications as they thought advisable then read and adopted without opposition— In this way Resolutions recommending to innkeepers to close their barrooms on Sundays— To the officers of the army, exhorting them not to exact military service from the soldiers on that day, and a recommendation to the ministers of the gospel to preach a sermon once every year urging the faithful observanc of the day.— and there was a resolution expressing the regret of the Convention, that Congress should have within the last few years repeatedly have transacted public business on Sunday. As the essential business of the Convention was done, I resolved to return home this evening, and thinking it fair to leave judge Hall a turn to preside, I took leave of the Convention before adjourning at 1. O’Clock, upon which they passed a vote of thanks— I dined at Barnum’s—excused myself to J. P. Kennedy who had invited me to dine with him to-morrow, took the Cars for Washington at 5. found Benjamin at the depot, and walked home. "

I could not comprize in one page the journal of yesterday, nor finish the account of the day before breakfast— My wife had charged me to procure for her two handsome picture frames for the portraits of her eldest sister, Nancy, the first Mrs Hellen and of herself painted by Savage, before they were married— I went accordingly to the shop of Mr Fryer in Gay Street— My wife had named him to me, and the bar-keeper at Barnum’s had assured me that his shop was the best shop for that Article in the City— I found and bespoke the two frames for 20 dollars and directed them to be sent to the depot of the rail-road Cars, boxed up—this afternoon or to-morrow morning as I should thereafter advise— Precisely at 9. O’Clock I took the Chair of the Convention, of whom very few members were present Bishop Waugh of the methodist episcopal church made the prayer kneeling— The Revd. Justin Edwards Chairman of the business Committee presented successively a number of resolutions all having reference to the observance of the Lord’s day; and three several addresses to the Canal Commissioners to the Directors of Railroads, and to the People of the United States, all of which were read and adopted by the Convention without debate— Sundry members of the Convention offered separate Resolutions, which were referred to the business committee, then reported by them with such modifications as they thought advisable then read and adopted without opposition— In this way Resolutions recommending to innkeepers to close their barrooms on Sundays— To the officers of the army, exhorting them not to exact military service from the soldiers on that day, and a recommendation to the ministers of the gospel to preach a sermon once every year urging the faithful observanc of the day.— and there was a resolution expressing the regret of the Convention, that Congress should have within the last few years repeatedly have transacted public business on Sunday. As the essential business of the Convention was done, I resolved to return home this evening, and thinking it fair to leave judge Hall a turn to preside, I took leave of the Convention before adjourning at 1. O’Clock, upon which they passed a vote of thanks— I dined at Barnum’s—excused myself to J. P. Kennedy who had invited me to dine with him to-morrow, took the Cars for Washington at 5. found Benjamin at the depot, and walked home. "

Next at the Franklin Insurance Company Office I recived a dividend of 316.75 which I deposited in the Patriotic Bank— At the National Intelligencer Office I saw Mr Seaton, and returned two papers of the 18th. and 19th. of this month of which they had sent me duplicates but they had not a spare copy of the paper of 28 September last which is yet missing from my file— I brought up my journal but could write nothing else— From breakfast time till past noon upwards of three hours I was swallowed up in reading Newspapers, received this morning— The Baltimore Patriot of Yesterday, and Sun of this day contain detailed reports of the proceedings of the Lord’s day Convention till their final adjournment last evening— In the Boston Semi-weekly Advertiser of Wednesday the 27th. received under a cover endorsed George E. Ellis, there is a report of the proceedings at the 40th. anniversary of the New-York historical Society on the 20th. doubtless written by Mr Ellis himself, and in a spirit of kindness to me.— In the Brooklyn Evening Star of Tuesday the 26th. received under cover without indication from whom, there is a Letter dated at Quincy—Masstts. 23. November 1844. signed E. M. and giving an account of a visit to the grave yard at Quincy, and to the houses and chambers in which my father and myself were born— Of Mr Lunt’s 200th. anniversary discourses with my hour glass hymn— All these papers I read with a deep interest—was it egotism? vanity? pride? or excusable weakness If so, may it be forgiven!— I had a long visit from Mr Pakenham, the Minister from Great Britain— He said there had not been one line of correspondence between Mr Calhoun and him since the close of the last Session of Congress—nor to his knowledge between Mr Edward Everett and the British Government— He appears to apprehend no collision between the two Governments— Richard D. Cutts was here this afternoon, and Philip R. Fendall in the Evening— I gave him the newspaper copies of my three Addresses to the young men of Boston; to my constituents at Braintree and at North-Bridgwater. He is one of the very few men who will read them all.— A young man from Lowell by the name of Whittemore was here in great want. "

There is a great variety of business, public and private which passes over from one session of Congress to the next, and of which I have found it extremely difficult and not unfrequently impossible to keep the thread. In the intervals between the Sessions individuals apply for pensions, for petitions to Congress or pension claims new or old before Congress or the Executive Departments— I have kept since 1835 a docket of petitions, which have absorbed a vast portion of my time, besides publishing lists of them in the National Intelligencer— A want of system in keeping a day-book of all business under my charge whether before Congress or the departments has often made me lose sight of particular cases, and had the appearance and the results of neglect. Instead of keeping one continuous book I have scattered my minutes and memoranda over numerous quires of paper, and know not where to look for the one, I happen at any time to want.— I found this morning on my files of papers, three applications for pensions, and two for Cadet warrants, which required my immediate attention. 1. The declaration of Mary Jennison of Boston, widow of William Jennison 2. The Declaration of Hannah Allen, heretofore widow of Zebah Thayer—now of Roxbury—and 3. A Letter from Joseph Benedict—dated Utica 3. Octr. 1844. claiming a pension for his father, for service of his grandfather— The papers of these three claims I took to the Pension Office, and left them with the Commissioner James L. Edwards, who promised answers to them— I met Mr Frye who has removed to the seven buildings and I returned the visit of Mr Pakenham, the Minister from Great Britain— He told me he had made very little progress with Mr Calhoun in the Negotiation for the Oregon. And he avowed the claim of Great Britain to the Columbia river— I received a Letter of 4 November current from George Joy, Pentonville, London with sundry documents printed and manuscript, and I wrote to George Rundle to enclose the certificates of Schuylkill bridge Stock.

The houses on the other side of the street intercept his rising and setting beams— I attended public worship morning and afternoon at the second Presbyterian church— Mr Knox was in the pulpit; but the morning preacher was Mr Nourse— His text was from Philippians 2.12—“work out your own salvation with fear and trembling 13. For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” There is a compromise of doctrine in this text, between free will, and predestination— For as God worketh in us to will as well as to do, we may work out our own salvation by prayer for the will, as well as for action. Mr Knox gave notice that the communion would be administered next Sunday afternoon— Dr Justin Edwards preached in the afternoon, from Mark 2.27.— “The Sabbath was made for man”—and he went over all the topics, and repeated the arguments which he had held forth at the Lord’s day convention last week at Baltimore— There is error in the strictness of construction, which these persons give to the precept— Dr Edwards left out of his text the concluding words in the verse Mark 2.27.—“and not man for the Sabbath.” I quoted the whole last week at Baltimore, believing as I do, that the qualification is as necessary to the religious principle as the injunction itself.— Works of necessity and of charity are not incompatible with the holiness of the day. Dr Edwards gave notice that he should preach to-morrow evening at the Presbyterian church in 9th. Street on the same subject, and should then notice the objections to the consecration of the Sabbath drawn from certain passages of the New Testament— The argument upon which he most emphatically dwelt was the physical necessity of hebdomadal repose to the nature not only of man but of horses.— In support of which he alledged facts not altogether unquestionable to prove that men who labour or travel six days in the week, and rest the 7th. perform more work, and travel farther in a series of weeks, than men who allow themselves no intermission. And he said there was the same testimony with regard to horses— A more unequivocally authenticated fact is attested by the records of the New-York penitentiary that more than four fifths of the inmates of that establishment are persons regardless of the Sabbath— I received this morning a letter from my Son with half a post Note of the Merchants Bank Boston which I forwarded to Mrs Harriet Boyd at Green Bay, Wiskonsin Territory— And I enclosed to George Rundle Philadelphia the certificates of 600 dollars permanent Schuylkill bridge Stock. W Hellen took the Letters to the Post-Office. "

Ingersoll.— Isaac E. Holmes of Charleston South-Carolina moved the immediate appointment of a Chaplain— The Speaker told him there must first be a joint Resolution for the appointment of two Chaplains of different denominations, one by each house to interchange weekly— He then moved the usual resolution— John Pettit of Indiana moved an amendment, provided that the chaplains should be paid by voluntary contribution of the members without charge upon the people, and said he had prepared a subscription paper, and put down his own name for 5 dollars; and if any one would give more, he would engage to double any such increased subscription, and then he made a stump speech— M’Connell moved the previous question— M’Kay said there was a law authorizing appropriations to pay for chaplains, and Steenrod the appropriation for the present Session was already made— The Speaker said these objections came too late. Pettit’s amendment was rejected by yeas and nays 151 to 20. and Holmes’s Resolution was adopted without call for yeas and nays.

I said I hoped the question upon my resolution would be taken— The Clerk called the roll, and the motion to lay on the table was rejected 81 to 104— The question was then put on the resolution and it was carried 108 to 80.—blessed ever blessed be the name of God!— The President’s Message was immediately afterwards read and some debate followed how to dispose of it— Referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and 10000 copies of it to be printed— After some miscellaneous business about 3 the house adjourned.

Black, a bill to regulate the pay of the Army, and for other purposes—by Phoenix a bill to repeal the duty on rail road iron— By Dana, a bill to abolish the franking privilege and to reduce the rates of postage— I required that these and all such notices should be read— Duncan of Cincinnati offered his bill for holding all the elections of the electoral colleges on one and the same day throughout the Union. The rule required that he should ask and obtain leave to introduce the bill, and that it should be called up with Resolutions— He moved a suspension of the rules, and called for the yeas and nays, of which there were none, 172 ayes— His bill was read twice, and an hour’s debate sprung up what should be done with it— The debate was superfluous there being no opposition to the principle of the bill.

I voted for Mr Hale a son of Nathan Hale of Boston, who is preaching here at the Unitarian Church—but he was not more successful than Dr. Muller— At the third vote, Mr Daley got 104 votes and was chosen— I was one of the voters for him, to get through a tedious process— The house then adjourned— I received this Evening a Letter from Mr Allan B.

He had then succeeded in accumulating a large fortune by forming a community at Lanark in Scotland, consisting of poor labourers but who were said to prosper into competency and affluence and contentment while they made his fortune— But he was ambitious of working his system upon a larger scale, and he came to this country full of the scheme of new modeling human society. He formed an establishment, in the State of Indiana, named New Harmony, and delivered discourses on the new organization of Society; and trumpeted abroad his Utopia till it fell into ruin—his establishment was left a wreck, and he went back to his own country to practice dupery again there. He had however acquired a large landed property, which his Son Robert Dale Owen was left to manage; and he after strolling about the country preaching infidelity and prostitution, till they found themselves threatened with Lynch Law by the rabble, and parted— Fanny Wright now calling herself Madame D’Arusmon and going home to Dundee; and Robert Dale Owen returning to Indiana, a demagogue of the first water, till he has wormed himself into Congress with such fellows as Pettit, and Henley, and John W. Davis, and Andrew Kennedy, and Proffit, the scum and dregs of the political cauldron— Robert Owen and Fanny Wright have now come again to this Country, and he apparently as crafty, crazy as ever— He said he wanted to have a long interview with me, and I promised to receive him any morning from ten to twelve. At the War Department I left Jonathan Amory’s Letter applying for a Cadet warrat for his son Thomas C— I compared the handwriting of General Jackson’s note accepting my invitation to dine on the 4th. of March 1819—with that of a Letter from him to the Secretary of War of 1. Feby 1819. and they appeared to be the same— The House after sundry notices given at half past 12. Adjourned over to next Monday. Lieutenant Ord of the army called on me, and requested my atten to a claim of his brother Pacificus Ord to compensation for services in a public office, against which he says I voted at the last Session of Congress for want of satisfactory evidence in its support— Mr Elliot was here this evening and gave me a list of whigs and democrats who voted for and against rescinding the 25th. rule.

Mr Robert Owen came again this morning, and Mesmerized me for the space of an hour and a half with his lunacies about a new organization of Society under the auspices of the two most powerful Nations on the face of the globe—Great Britain on the Eastern, and the United States on the Western Hemisphere. The materials he says are abundant; and the arrangements are all of simple and easy execution— He has prepared a plan in which all the details are set forth with the minutest accuracy.— It is now in the hands of Mr Pakenham, but he will ask him to return it and will communicate it to me for my examination— It is a plan for universal education, for which the Smithsonian fund may provide the means without interfering at all with my views— After the establishment of the system there will be no War and no such thing as poverty— Universal competency will be the lot of all mankind; and want will be unknown.— All this I had heard twenty-five years ago, and the humbug is too stale.— His last departure from this Country he says was in 1830. when, by his agency, General Jackson and Mr Van Buren, settled all the differences between this Country and Great Britain— Since then he has been negotiating in Mexico, in Austria and Prussia, and has been working five hours a day upon his great plan which he has now brought to maturity— I asked him if he was acquainted with the Fourier plan of a community, he said yes; and personally with the man— He was no more than a Clerk in a Merchant’s Counting house, ingenious and fanciful, without experience of the world or knowledge of mankind— Dr. Mayo was here and told me that he meant to answer Andrew Jackson’s indirect attack upon him, about the Letter to Fulton, in his imploring Letter to Blair the Editor of the Globe— Mayo had not seen my reply to Jackson’s Letter to Armstrong in the North Bridgwater Address— I gave him a copy of the Boston Courier containing it— He said that Jackson was the greatest liar that this Country had ever produced and that the Committee on the Fulton claim had proved it upon him— Daley is a coloured man who brought samples of Gunpowder and black Tea which he brought with him from China. Mr Fischer came with a complaint against M’Nulty the clerk of the house for speculating in his purchases of Stationery— I called at the Patriotic Bank and drew 200 dollars by Check. Visits from J. P. Kennedy and R. C. Winthop Evening with Walter Hellen at the concert of Swiss Campanologians. "

I should have done much business this day at the War and Navy Departments and in the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, in overhauling the unfinished business of former Sessions of Congress to be replaced upon the Calendar— But Sloth creeps irresistibly upon leisure, and a walk of about half an hour was my only substitute for a visit to the Department and to the house— Mr Kellogg is the President of a College at Galesburg in the State of Illinois, travelling I suppose for the purpose of collecting contributions; but he asked none from me. He alledged no other than curiosity, and said that his college had commenced in 1837 as a school for teachers, preparatory for college, and had about 140 pupils— Since 1841. it had become a college, having now three classes and expecting a fourth next year—ten students to each Class— Mr Patterson, a member of the house from Rochester, New-York called and urged me very earnestly to come out with a severe declaration in the house against the Liberty party-abolitionists— I distrust very much the advice of Mr Patterson— I told him I thought the Liberty party had taken the most effectual means to demolish themselves; and as they had repelled and denounced me, it would have an appearance of private and personal resentment if I should retort upon them— They had done all the mischief in their power— It is irreparable— There may be an occasion upon which I may without impropriety express my opinion of them; but I shall not seek it— Among the Letters that I received yesterday was one from New-York dated 4. Decr., the writer of which says that canvassing a few days since with Governor Poindexter at the Galt house in Louisville he Poindexter said the morning when Jackson had the interview with me concerning the Florida Treaty he had been at Poindexter’s room, and on leaving it said that it was to fufil an engagement to meet me and Mr Monroe on that subject. But it was to meet me, and not Mr Monroe; and this is an anonymous Letter— I had morning visits also from Mr Thomasson and judge Pyrtle, from Louisville, Kentucky. the latter is here in attendance on the Supreme Court.

                "text": "8. V. Sunday.  I attended public worship in the hall of the house of representatives, where Mr Tuston, the chaplain of the Senate began by giving out to be sung Watts’s hundredth Psalm, reading by two lines at a time; setting the tune himself, and requesting his hearers to join him as far as practicable— He then made a short and fervent prayer—read the 12th. chapter of Paul’s epistle to the Romans, and preached from Philippians 3.3. “For we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.” Mr Tuston in this as in many other of his discourses, very earnestly disclaimed all sectarianism of forms, and all bigoted attachment to peculiar modes of worship— He said there were two points upon which he had no doubt that every person professing the name of Christ of whatever denomination would agree— 1. To worship God in the spirit; and 2. And to place all his hopes of salvation, alone upon the merits of the redeemer— Mr Tuston’s manner is peculiarly tender and affectionate to his hearers, and in this he conciliates their favour rather than by the copiousness the vigour or the ingenuity of his intellect.— The Epistle to the Philippians is a heart searching exhortation to concord—written in prison—plaintive but not desponding—rather boastful of himself and glorying in his sufferings.— It is almost entirely about himself and expresses gratitude to them, as the only church that had contributed to his personal support— I perceive Mr Tuston’s inducement to the selection of his text— After dinner at St John’s church, Mr Pine read the Evening service for the second Sunday in Advent. The second lesson of which was the 12th. chapter of Romans which Mr Tuston had read this morning— Mr Pine preached a short Sermon from Ephesians 1.18. “The eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling.”— Mr Pyne is a pleasing preacher and a very intelligent and amiable man— As I was returning home from church I was overtaken by Mr Peter Hagner, who came in and passed a quarter of an hour with me. In the evening General Daniel Parker called and brought with him a number of papers from the files of the War Department in the handwriting of his staff officers—he offered to leave them with me, but I declined keeping them— Visits from Mr Phoenix and Mr Moseley.

Sleepless night, caused by breakfasting on coffee yesterday morning, and drinking a cup of tea last evening.— A sluggish, drowy, torpid day succeeds.— At the house, Mr Tuston opened the day with a short studied prayer— On the reading of the Journal the standing Committees were announced. The Speaker has again appointed me chairman of the Committee of Manufactures— Thomasson came and told me that he and another anti-Texas members of the Committee of foreign Affairs at the last Session have been removed and that the Committee now are Texas. The reading of the journal was no sooner finished than Hammett of Mississippi, began to move a resolution for referring to a select Committee so much of the President’s message as relates to Texas— Dromgoole told him that he had a series of Resolutions ready to distribute to the several standing committees the various topics of the message, for which purpose he should move to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Hammet immediately gave way. Dromgoole made his motion, and the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Cave Johnson in the Chair— Dromgoole presented ten Resolutions distributing the Message to as many standing Committees— Only one question was taken upon the whole series of Resolutions, and they were adopted in a lump. Dromgoole then moved that the Committee should rise and report which was done—and the report was adopted without a word of debate. But before passing Dromgoole’s Resolutions the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union had taken up Duncan’s bill for holding the election of the Presidential Electors, on one and the same day throughout the Union— This gave rise to a dull and tedious debate chiefly raised by Elmer chairman of the Committee of elections, of which the Committee soon got tired and laid the bill aside. In the Clerk’s Office, I looked up the bill for the relief of Joseph Holmes, and the owners of the Schooner Industry.— This Evening Mr Samuel Hoare called on me and told me the particulars of his expulsion by mob violence from Charleston South-Carolina, where he had been sent as a Commissioner to protect the personal rights of coloured citizens of Massachusetts imprisoned under a Slave-law of the State. He barely escaped with life and limb— I approved the whole of his conduct, and advised him to see the other members of the delegation from Massachusetts before proceeding home. Mr Markoe called to invite me to a meeting of the Institute, but I declined— "

Tuesday  Mr Robert Owen brought me this morning a small bound printed book, by himself, a second edition, London 1841. entitled a Developement of the principles and plans on which to establish Self-supporting home-colonies— He left it, with me, and said he would call for it again to-morrow— From the cursory glance at its contents which is all that I can bestow, I find it a new edition of his old exploded projects— At the house I gave notice of my intention to ask leave to introduce a bill for the relief of Joseph Holmes and the owners of the Schooner Industry. After some other interlocutory motions Giddings asked the Speaker what was the regular business of the day, and he answered the call of the States for Petitions— Giddings then called for the Order of business and the Speaker announced Petitions in order from the State of Maine.— There were none from Maine— One or two from New-Hampshire. The call came at once upon Massachusetts. I had only three petitions to present. 1. from John P. Andrews of Salem for the promotion of universal peace— Referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs. 2. from Edward Jarvis and J. Wingate Thornton Committee of the American Statistical Association, a memorial concerning the errors in the census of 1840— I moved its reference to the Committee of Statistics of the last Session if it still existed, and that it should be printed.— The Speaker said that was a select Committee only for the Session and did not now exist— I then moved the reference to a select Committee of 9 which was adopted—but objection was made to the printing— Preston King called for its being read. The Clerk read about 5 minutes—till they tired and dispensed with the further reading.— a motion was made to lay the motion to print on the table—carried 101. to 79.— 3. Petition from A. B. Kingsland and 4 other residents in the City of New-York for the abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia— I moved its reference to the Committee on the district. Black of Georgia objected to its reception. Brown of Indiana moved to lay the objection on the table, lost by yeas and nays 90 to 99. Question on the reception of the Petition 107 to 81.— Tibbatts moved to lay the petition on the table—lost 88 to 99 and it was referred to the Committee on the District— Much matter for reflection on these proceedings.— The call for petitions proceeded till they came to Ohio—and when Giddings rose a motion to adjourn was made and carried— John Connell was here this Evening.

I told him I had cursorily looked over as much of it as my time would allow, and that I had not been able to bring my mind to the approbation of his plan— He went over the same preamble that I had heard from him 27 years ago in London; which he had afterwards crowded upon me year after year here, when I was Secretary of State and President, and from which I have hoped for the last fifteen years that this Country was forever delivered.— He said he wanted his book now; but he would send it to me again to be examined and studied at my leisure; for it required profound study to understand it— It was to change the basis of human society; to put every individual of the human race in the proper place to promote his own happiness, and needed only to be put into operation to accomplish its purpose. At the house Douglas of Illinois gave notice that he would at an early day move for leave to introduce a bill to establish a new territory with a strange name— Houston of Alabama moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the Bill N. 2. reported at the last Session from the Committee on the Territories— Duncan insisted upon the preference to his bill for holding the election of Presidential electors throughout the Union one and the same day. Houston yielded the precedence— The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and first took up Duncan’s bill— Elmer and Hannibal Hamlin still nibbled at the Bill, till Duncan proposed an entire substitute for his bill accommodated to their projected amendments. It was adopted by the Committee, and laid aside to be reported to the house—but Dromgoole was still dissatisfied, and offered another entire substitute of his own, which the Speaker decided came too late, but said it might be offered in the house. Houston’s Bill for reducing and graduating the price of the public lands was then taken up— It proposes to authorise the sale of all the public lands which have been 5 years upon sale for one dollar an all that have been ten years upon sale for 75 cents—all that have been 15 years in the market for 50 cents, and all that have been 20 years on hand for 25 cents an acre— This bill was supported by Houston, by Sample and John W. Davis of Indiana, and opposed by Collamer of Vermont, and by Vinton of Ohio— It will break up the whole system of the sales of the public lands, and will give them away— Mr Hawley was here this evening.

Dodge, delegate from the Territory of Iowa presented a memorial asking admission into the Union and a copy of their Constitution which after some discussion was referred to the Committee on the Territories— The Committees were called for Reports, but the only one presented was by Charles J.

Saturday—  I had intended to visit the Offices of the War and Navy Departments this morning upon private business, but a succession of visitors absorbed my time till it was too late.— An old widow woman by the name of Thompson, came with a written recommendation in the name of Mrs Wickliffe wife of the Postmaster General, to charity— Her plea was touching by its simplicity—and urged in language evidently betokening former ease and comfort and actual urgent want— Mrs Royall’s Sally came too for a year’s subscription to her Newspaper now called the Huntress—a tax of charity in another form— I had a morning visit in another form— Morning visit from Mr Giddings of Ohio, with four members of the Pennsylvania delegation, all honest and honorable men.— A person by the name of Harriman came and asked for a copy of my Address at Braintree to which Charles J. Ingersoll has published an answer— He said he had been engaged as an editor and writer for newspapers in sundry places, and he was now connected with the Baltimore Patriot— That he wished to give some account of Ingersoll’s publication, and for that purpose to see my address which gave rise to it— I gave him a copy of each of the three papers containing the addresses of 7. October 30 Octr and 6. November, at Boston, Braintree and North Bridgwater. I wished to have some conversation with him on the whole subject but Mr and Mrs Marks came in, with a Letter of Introduction from Mr Phoenix. They are a young couple recently married, to reside in the city of New-York, visiting here for curiosity, and Mr Phoenix told me yesterday that they had expressed a desire to see me, and that he would give them a line introductory to me, for which I thanked him— Mr Daniel P. King with his two daughters and Mr and Mrs Marsh of Vermont were also visitors but did not come in— I took a walk before dinner— Met Mr John P. Kennedy, and walked with him to his lodgings at Mrs Whitwells on Capitol Hill Saw there, Mr and Mrs Grinnell, Senators Evans and Miller, and General Scott. "

Brown “to the public at large and to the Constituents of the Hon. John Quincy Adams in particular.” This is the third of the gang of conspirators who opened their batteries on me in the Globe of the 20th. of March last, and whom I exposed in my addresses at Boston—Braintree and North Bridgwater— The Lion and his two Jackals are now out— The first tool of Jackson George W. Erving is yet to be heard from— I must reply at leisure to them all. But the whole tissue of falsehood of Jackson’s Erwin Treaty is abandoned without an attempt to support it— I attended public worship at the Hall of the House of Representatives where Mr Tuston preached from Luke 22.31. [“]And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; 32. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not”— Mr Tuston speculated after his own manner upon the extraordinary circumstances under which St. Peter was prayed for by Jesus Christ himself; and started an enquiry whether it was a special personal, and exclusive favour granted to Peter, or a general blessing bestowed upon all believers. That there was some specialty in it was beyond a doubt because he was accosted twice by name—Simon—Simon—but as the whole life of Jesus was one continued dispensation of favours and he went about doing good, there was encouragement for every one to hope that he too in his troubles and trials, his temptations and distresses was though unconsciously guarded and sustained by the prayers of the redeemer of the world.— There is cheering benevolence in the thought, and internal evidence that it sprang from a tender and affectionate heart— Two young men brothers by the name of Tracy, were introduced to me after the service by a member from Connecticut.— After dinner I attended Church at St. John’s, where Mr Pine read the Evening prayer for the 3d. Sunday in Advent and preached from 2. Corinthians 5.17. [“]Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away: behold all things are become new”— A rational essay upon regeneration with an eloquent and pathetic account of his own experience. St. John’s church took fire this morning just before the morning service began; but was extinguished so that it was not interrupted "

This day a grate for burning Lehigh Coal was put up in my writing chamber instead of the open hearth and chimney corner in which for the last six winters I have been in the practice of burning wood— Few persons can imagine how gravely the comfort of my life is affected by this trivial incident of mere personal habitudes— Seven months of the year from the first of October to the last of April, I can write only by the side of a fire— For as long a time, I need the convenience of a morning and evening lamp; from 6 to 8 hours every day.— These are the hours of labour for the day—the hours of solitude and of toil.— I must light my fire and my lamp every morning and my capacity to write depends upon the temperature of the atmosphere operating upon my sense of feeling.— The experiment of the coal fire is now again to be tried; heretofore it has not suited me so well as wood— Mr Giddings, Mr and Mrs Tilden and Mr and Mrs Hamlin paid me a morning visit— At the house, the first business was the question upon the engrossment of Duncan’s Bill, for holding the election of Electors of President and Vice-President of the United States on one and the same day throughout the Union— Duncan demanded the yeas and nays and they were taken 187 ay—and 1. Nay—Woodward of South-Carolina— James A. Black only of the South Carolina delegation voted for the bill— Burt, Campbell, Holmes and Rhett did not vote. The bill was then passed without an opposing vote— Burke of New-Hampshire moved a suspension of the rules for a motion to print 10000 copies of the majority and minority reports on the Rhode-Island Insurrection memorial—yeas 103—nays 87. motion lost. Weller asked leave to introduce a bill to extend the right of suffrage in the city of Washington— Campbell objected, that there was a bill before the house reported by the Committee on the District containing the same provision. Weller moved and carried a suspension of the rules—62 to 124. Weller introduced his bill, and pressed for its immediate passage; but objections were started in his own gang, and the bill was referred to the Committee on the District.— Duncan moved and carried a suspension of the rules to introduce a bill for establishing the territory of Oregon and other purposes, which was referred to the Committee on the Territories. The annual reports of the Secretary of the Treasury on the finances with the estimates, and of the Commissioner of the general Land Office were presented to the house. Phoenix moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the warehouse bill, but could not get a quorum to vote. Adjourned before 3. "

My wife had in the middle of the Night a fit of coughing incessant for nearly an hour, and distressing to herself and to me, more than words can record.— I was up, between two and three and returning then again to bed lost two of my morning hours from the consciousness of existence and the capacity for action.— At the house after notices given by several members of their intention to ask leave to-morrow or on some subsequent day to bring in sundry bills, Mr Vinton moved a suspension of the Rules, to call the States for Resolutions, which was carried; and a budget of crudities of every sort and description issued forth as always happens on resolution days— The first move was by Hannibal Hamlin of Maine was to print ten thousand copies of the majority and minority reports on the Rhode-Island Memorials— Objection being made the Resolution of course went over one day— But Hamlin enquired if he could now cut off debate when the resolution shall come up in order— The Speaker said he could by now moving the previous question, which he did— Winthrop objected to this—and I asked the Speaker to reconsider his decision—observing that the form of the previous question was “shall the main question now be put;[”] and it could not be in order when a positive rule of the house forbade the taking of the question now— The Speaker said no debate was in order now, but that although the form of the previous question was, shall the main question now be put—it might be moved now and postponed to another day, because without the second of a majority, it could not be put at all— Cranston intreated of Hamlin as a personal favour to withdraw his motion for the previous question but he would not. Charles J. Ingersoll moved a resolution that the tariff act of 1842 should be modified so far as respects foreign wines, where it conflicts with Treaties or is otherwise objectionable—also that a nominal duty be imposed on all free articles for the precise ascertainment of them— Black of Georgia moved to strike out nominal and insert revenue which produced shouts of laughter— Ingersoll was advised to change his motion into an enquiry of expediency.— This he was glad to do, and in that form his motion passed— Dromgoole produced a Letter from Mrs Madison offering to Congress the remainder of her husband’s manuscripts not heretofore purchased, and moved a Resolution authorising the library Committee to contract for purchasing and printing them—Adopted— Messrs. Hudson and Asher Tyler were here this Evening—and Connell but I did not see him. "

Street near the general Post Office, and to whom I promised to perform that service came this morning and said they had fixed upon next Friday evening from 7 to half past 7, and that he would call upon me with a carriage at that time— I spoke of the necessity of strong light, and said I should be glad to see the place where I am to read. He said it should be open between 2. and 3. this afternoon. I had summoned a Meeting of the Committee of manufactures to meet in their chamber this morning at 11. O’Clock— By a most vexatious incident The Clock in my writing chamber ran down and stop’d just at that time, so that I was belated in reaching the Capitol, by half an hour. I found every member of the Committee present in the chamber when I arrived and apologized to them for my tardiness— I then said I had called them together merely to organize the Committee—to tell them I had nothing to lay before them, and to take their Commands. If any other member of the Committee had any thing to propose, they would now receive his communication— The word manufactures was not in the President’s Message, and there was nothing referred to the Committee by the house— I proposed therefore to record a minute of the meeting and adjourn without day to be called again, if any reference should be made by the house, or any member of the Committee should desire it— Which was forth with unanimously agreed to— I went down to my seat in the house— A page named Cox came and said, a few minutes before the house was called to order, that Mr Sangster wished to speak with me at the door— I went to the door at the side—then to the central door but no one accosted me. I turned back and some one said the man is in the lobby— I went into the lobby—a man came up to me, and said you are wrong, you are wrong, and I will kick you— He then passed his right hand before my face and drew it back to strike me— I seized his two arms with my two hands and held them till the by standers came up and took charge of him. I returned to my Seat— They afterwards arrested the man— A magistrate came and in the Speaker’s room sent for me, took my affidavit of the assault, and committed Sangster to answer for it. Mr Holmes of Charleston and Mr Chilton were present I have no room for the proceedings in the house. "

There was no room left on my page of yesterday to notice the proceedings of the house— They consisted of little more than two speeches, both in form against Phoenix’s bill to repeal the duties on rail-road iron, but directly opposite to each other in principle one from Henry D. Foster hot for a protective tariff and one from W. W. Payne of Alabama, red hot against the protective tariff, and foaming for a horizontal duty of 20 per cent— Hammett of Mississippi, saw they were coming to slippery democratic ground, and moved to lay the whole subject on the table, which was carried by yeas and nays 155 to 40— I said I was willing to lay the Bill on the table, if Burt’s bill to repeal the duty on Cotton bagging and gunny cloth should go on the table also— But Houston said no more bargains, and the Speaker said there must be no debate on a motion to lay on the table— Burt’s bill had been twice read and referred to a Committee without a word of opposition or remark. Weller gave notice that he would this day offer a joint Resolution for the annexation of Texas to the United States; and this day he did introduce it— Twice read and he moved its reference to a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— E. S. Hamlin of Ohio moved its reference to a Committee of one member from each State, with instructions to report upon five questions. The question of commitment to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union was taken by yeas and nays and carried 109 to 60.— Pollock gave notice of his intention to ask leave to introduce a bill or resolution, to submit the question of the annexation of Texas to the People— A Message was received from the President, with the brawling correspondence between Calhoun, Shannon and the Mexican Minster of foreign Affairs Manuel Cresencio Rejon— The Message rails at the Mexican Government with the temper of a common scold, and concludes by saying that although we should be fully justified in declaring War against them, he will not recommend that, but only that we should take Texas and then if Mexico makes war upon us, all the responsibility of it shall rest upon her.— The Message was referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs. The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Cave Johnson in the Chair and took up the Bill for graduating the price of the public Lands. Orlando B. Ficklin made a fiery speech for the Bill, and Causin of Maryland a warm one against it— John J. Hardin of Illinois from the Post-Office Committee reported a Bill to reduce postage— Mr Frye and his Son, David Hall and a Doctor Thomas were here; and a young man named Sears. "

I read this morning the whole correspondence communicated yesterday with the message of the President, and see the subjugation of this Union to the double slave representation with deplorable certainty of proof— John C. Calhoun and South Carolina are in the ascendant, and an internal convulsion in Mexico happens at this moment as if by interposition of the evil principle to help him to consummate his abominable purpose— The prospect is deathlike— I found the house in Session. Joseph Vance chairman of the Committee of claims was calling for the orders of the day—private business— Hardin wanted to get up the Post-Office Bill— Dromgoole and Charles J. Ingersoll wanted to suspend the rules for notices of Bills, and Aaron V. Brown for Reports of Committees. After two or three votes without a Quorum Dromgoole got the house into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Cave Johnson in the chair— The bill for graduating the price of the public lands was the unfinished business and Robert Smith of Illinois had the floor from yesterday. Dromgoole moved to postpone it and said there were certain modifications of it about which its friends were in treaty with one another— To this postponement Robert Smith consented and Dromgoole moved to take up the Sub-treasury Bill, reported by him from the Committee of Ways and Means at the last Session— It was taken up without opposition, and after two or three Sections of it had been read by the clerk, the further reading of it through was dispensed with and it was read by Sections.— The Clerk had read through the first Section and begun upon the second, when seeing it was going to pass without a sign of life from the opposition I rose and enquired if the first section of the Bill constituting certain vaults in the Treasury building The Treasury of the United States, was the same, as in the old Sub-treasury repealed Law— It was. I moved to strike out the first section of the Bill— The chairman pronounced it not in order, and the question upon it was not suffered to be put.— I gave my reasons however in substance that it annuled the proviso in the Constitution that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by Law— This started a debate which continued till half-past 4. when the committee rose and the house adjourned— In the Evening I delivered my Lecture on Society and Civilization at the new Baptist Church— Miss Cutts passed the Evening here.

Street—among whom were Mr Seaton the Mayor of the City, Mr Bacon the President of the Columbia College, and his wife who after the lecture were introduced to me.— Mrs Bacon said she came from Boston, and she cordially invited me to their house on the College hill— Doctor Sewall with his niece, and Mr Fendall were also present— Walter Hellen went with me— This morning Mr Connell called upon me in high spirits— His bill for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton, having again passed the Senate— One of the principal obstacles to the passage of this bill hitherto has been the false denial by Andrew Jackson of his own military order for the employment of a Steamboat of Fulton’s in the public service.— The order under his own hand has been produced but he has not retracted his denial. Mr Connell intreated me not to notice this exemplification of Jackson’s memory when the bill shall be before the house— The business of this day in the house of Dromgoole’s subtreasury bill— He had moved last evening a resolution to report it to the house in 30 minutes after it should next be taken up in Committee of the whole; but the house adjourned without taking the question upon that motion.— This morning he modified it so as to allow 2. hours instead of 30 minutes for debate—this was carried— The house went into Committee of the whole, Cave Johnson in the chair, and the two hours were occupied by Henley of Indiana and others of the democracy, in vilifying the whigs and Henry Clay.— Not a whig was suffered to get the floor, and Cave the chairman gave it in flagrant partiality to Henley in competition with Clingman of North Carolina.A new member from Maine took the floor 5 minutes before the time fixed for reporting, and opened a flood of stench and filth upon the whigs He was interrupted by the report to the house, which the Speaker had no sooner announced than he started up and continued his speech begun in Committee. Mr Barnard objected to this as violating the rule that no allusion shall be made in the house to what has passed in Committee; bu the Speaker sustained the Mainiac. But his own party soon got weary of him— One moved the Committee to rise— Another moved the previous question, and he gave up. I moved again to strike out the first Section— The Speaker said it was not in order. The question of engrossment was carried by yeas and naysto 64. The question on its passageto 69. close party votes— Adjourned at half past 3. "

New-York District—Orleans and Niagara District resident at Lockport; a present whig.—Bailey the successor of Wise and W. W. Payne of Alabama— Hunt alluded to the democratic nomination at Saginaw for the Legislature of Michigan of Birney the Liberty party candidate for the Presidency—which operated like a spark upon a barrel of gunpowder.— The scene was ludicrous. MrDaily the Chaplain to the House of Representatives, has since last Tuesday made the daily two minutes morning prayer from the Speaker’s chair— This morning I heard him preach from Psalm 72.16. [“]There shall be a handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains: the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth 17. His name shall endure forever. His name shall be continued as long as the Sun: and men shall be blessed in him; all nations shall call him blessed. 18 Blessed be the Lord God; the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things— 19. And blessed be his glorious name forever. And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and amen.” The subject of the Sermon was the rapid growth of Christianity; and the delivery was the ne plus ultra of rant and vociferation.— It was upwards, of an hour long—rambling and desultory—interspersed after the methodist manner with little narrative pathetic anecdotes, and with microscopic descriptions of corn on the top of mountains, and the process of nature in the growth of grass.— After the service was over Mr Daily came and shook hands with me at my seat. Dr Sewall and Mrs Catherine Brown were there—and Mr Huntington, the Senator from Connecticut who told me that the Senate would stand firm, and there would be neither, Texas nor Tariff nor Subtreasury, at this Session of Congress.— I called at the United States Hotel.— Saw judge Pyrtle, and left a Card for Mr Thomasson.— Received a note from Mr Samuel L. Gouverneur and visited him at his house— Long conversation with him, and he gave me several extracts of Letters from Andrew Jackson in 1819. 20. and 21.— And a very significant Letter from T. L. L. Brent to President Monroe of 30. April 1818— From Mr Gouverneur’s, I went to St. John’s Church, where Mr Pyne was reading the evening service for the 4th Sunday in Advent— And he preached from Hebrews 2.16. “For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.”— Mary Louisa and I dined after returning from church.

In my conversation yesterday with Mr Gouverneur he told me that while never doubting of the moral obligation resting on him to inform me of the Letters from Andrew Jackson to President Monroe, extracts from which he gave me; he had been somewhat embarrassed as to the properest manner for him to proceed in the case— The partizans of Jackson would certainly assail him as in confederacy with me, and would bring against him the charge of betraying the confidence of private correspondence, and Jackson might deny his own Letters, and charge him with forgery as he had charged me with forging my own diary. He said he had consulted General Scott, and other friends in this emergency, by whose advice he had drawn up a paper which he proposed to publish in the National Intelligencer signed G. which he read to me; upon which he would be glad to have my advice, and after which I might make such use of the extracts from Jackson’s Letters, and other information received from him as I think proper— He told me further that General Scott had assured him there were two Officers of the army now in this city, who were here in February 1819. and then knowing to my consultation with Jackson about the Florida Treaty— But that he was not permitted to divulge their names.  This day at a quarter past 12 I found the house in Session, and the Speaker calling the Committees for Reports.— This was the day upon which Charles J. Ingersoll had given notice that he would call up for consideration in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, the joint Resolution reported by him from the Committee of foreign affairs for the annexation of Texas to the United States, according to the Treaty of 12 April last, rejected by the Senate. But he only moved a resolution to print 10,000 copies of the map of Texas, at a cost not exceeding 12 cents a copy, instead of his former resolution for 5000 copies at not exceeding 7 cents a copy— But Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois introduced another joint Resolution for the re-annexation of Texas to the United States according to the Louisiana Treaty of 1803.— Aaron V. Brown reported from the Committee on the Territories the bill for the establishment of the territory of Oregon— The Resolutions and notices of Bills Resolutions were numberless— Charles J. Ingersoll presented by special request a petition for the abolition of Slavery, and the application of all the proceeds of the Sales of the public Lands to indemnify the owners of the Slaves for their Loss of them as property— He moved reference to a Committee; but the House laid the petition on the table by yeas and nays 117 to 49. After a hard struggle to keep down the call for the yeas and nays, the house adjourned over to Thursday. "

Johnson of Utica came in this morning for a short visit on his way to Richmond, Virginia, to see his cousin Mrs Treadway, and her daughter Mrs Crane— I went to the Navy Department with the Letter of Mrs Mary Derby, in behalf of her brother, Horatio Townsend which I wished to recommend to the Secretary of the Navy John Y. Mason But he was gone upon a Christmas frolic to Virginia, and Commodore Charles Morris, acts as Secretary in his absence— I read Mrs Derby’s Letter to Commodore Morris, who doubted whether the favour solicited for Mr Townsend was within the competency of the Department without an application to Congress— But he took Mrs Derby’s Letter which he said he would refer to the 4th. Auditor the Officer upon whom the decision will rest. I then passed into the War Department and had a long Conversation with General Scott, now Commander in chief of the Army.— He commenced it by observing that he had read the Article in the National Intelligencer of this morning signed G.—being that which Mr Gouverneur read to me the day before yesterday.— He said that behind that Article there was a great mass of evidence which he had seen— That there were now in this city, two persons, who were in General Jackson’s apartment in February 1819. when I went there to consult him on the subject of the Florida Treaty— That they had recently each communicated the fact to the other and to him— They perfectly agreed in their recollection; but they had laid him under an injunction of honour not to disclose their names I said that I should probably in the course of next Spring or Summer address my Constituents again upon this subject; and I asked if I might state this fact as he had stated to me, without naming the persons, but vouching him for the fact—he said I might— That it was due to historical truth. And he deemed it the duty of every man to bear testimony to historical truth especially when the character of another was implicated in the fact. Mr Gouverneur had told me that these two persons were Officers in the army. I said to Scott that if Officers of the army, bound by the laws of honour thought they could withhold their names from testimony of facts known to them I would not insist upon their names.— He said—I do not say they are officers of the army.— I asked him to call at my house; and said I would shew him the volume of my Diary for 1819— He said he would— Mr Frye was here this evening and said a young man by the name of Sangster, a nephew of the man now in prison for assaulting me, had been to him and General Towson to obtain his release from prison, by discharging so much of the Justices warrant as required bonds for keeping the Peace— I said I was so far as concerned myself perfectly willing to release him if any security by himself or his friends that he would keep the Peace with me and with all others.

Christmas  I can give no reason satisfactory to myself for having neglected attending upon the religious public services of this day— Never in my life have I more needed Faith and Hope in the promises of the gospel for relief from anxieties from sources public and private— Never more fervent prayer for direction from above to direct me in the short remnant of the path before me— I have wasted the day with out being aware of my remissness till the day was gone— To the church of which I am a member there are no religious holidays, save the Christian Sabbath; but personally I sympathise with those who solemnize the two anniversaries Christmas and Easter—the birth and the resurrection of Jesus. I had a morning visit from Persico the Sculptor, who has been passing some time at Boston, New-York and Philadelphia— He has been making for a company of subscribers a bust of the late Doctor William Ellery Channing, and has made a model for an equestrian Statue of Washington He said the sublimest event in the life of Washington was the surrender of his Commission at the close of the War of Independence— His Statue was to be commemorative of that act. He had intensely studied for the likeness the bust by Houdon, and his Statue at Richmond— He had copied his uniform, now a relic at the patent Office, and his hat—and his purpose was to exhibit his person exactly as he was in life. He hoped to be employed by Congress to do this work; and he wished me to see his model, for which purpose I promised to meet him to-morrow morning at 11. in the library room of Congress— The day was uncommonly beautiful and mild— Before dinner I took a walk round the Capitol hill—passed on my return homewards, in the Pennsylvania avenue by the ruins of a Confectioner’s shop consumed this morning by fire— Morning visit from Dr Baldwin one of the largest claimants of indemnity from Mexico; with his son, a boy of 11 or 12 years old, who brought a beautiful posy as a present to Mrs. Adams.— Mr Frye was here again this evening with a written statement of what had passed between him and me last Evening about the release of Thomas Sangster from prison; and with a Letter from him to me— Mr Thompson the Magistrate who committed him, admitted him last evening to bail upon a certificate of a physician that he had examined him, and found him of sane mind, and upon laying his nephew under bond of 1000 dollars for his appearance at Court next week, and keeping in the mean time the peace— His Letter to me is respectful and apologetic, expressing great regret at his assault, attributing it to sudden and uncontroulable passion "

Ingersoll wormed in a bill providing that the children of Citizens of the United States born abroad shall be deemed native citizens, referred to the judiciary Committee.— Hammett of Mississippi presented a memorial from a coloured man named William Couch of Fairfield Connecticut now free; claiming a pension for services in the revolutionary War, while he was a slave.

Houston had voted for the resolution, unaware of the double Salary—on discovering that, his conscience smote him he moved the reconsideration and started an hour of debate which ended where it began— Belser of Alabama moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the Texas question— The Speaker called the Territories for Resolutions.

Cutts and her brother Richard D. spent part of last evening here— Christmas day and yesterday were more Summer than winter days, but the change came on in the course of last night in copious rain, first warm, then growing cold and turning finally to a cold snow-storm— William C. Johnson had come here with the intention of going no further South than Richmond—but he received last Evening a Letter, from a young Lady of Albany, a family connection, named Heard, earnestly intreating him to escort her, as far as Charleston South Carolina, on her way to Mobile, where she is going to reside as governess in a private family— He feels himself obliged to go, and took leave of us this evening, and went on board the Steamer for Fredericsburg to pass the night—her hour of departure being 3 in the morning. I found the house again in Session and Hammett of Mississippi had formally put the question to Charles J. Ingersoll when he intended to call up his resolution for the annexation of Texas, and he answered next Monday.— Parmenter chairman of the Committee of Naval Affairs moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up bill N. 214. limiting the number of commissioned and warrant officers in the navy, and regulating the complements of crews on board of vessels of war, and for other purposes. C. J. Ingersoll said he should move to take up a Bill for distributing a sum of money received for indemnities by a recent Convention with Peru— The house went into Committee, Cave Johnson in the chair— Parmenter and Ingersoll, each moved to take up his bill; but the chair said the unfinished business in Committee was the bill for reducing and graduating the price of the public Lands, upon which Robert Smith of Illinois had the floor. He ranted an hour upon the cruel injustice of making the poor settlers in the new States pay a dollar and a quarter an acre for their lands He was followed by John A. M’Clernand another land griping patriot from the same State for another hour.— Caleb B. Smith of Indiana then took the floor but the house were weary of the debate, and the Committee rose without coming to a conclusion. A report from the Secretary of the Treasury was received with the annual report of the superintendent of the Coast survey—and 500 extra copies were ordered to be printed— Sundry private bills from the Senate were twice read and referred to the appropriate Committees— A motion was with difficulty ushered in that when the house should adjourn it should be till Monday—which was carried by yeas and nays, 81. to 68.— I rode home in the Snow-Storm.

Congress.— I told him I thought it would be highly advisable, if the deed should not be perpetrated at the present Session— He thinks there is no danger of the passage of that measure, even in the house of Representatives at this Session— I fear he does not sufficiently weigh the despotism of the party drill.— He says there are forty members of the majority who will vote against every plan of annexation. I dread the effect of the revolution now raging in Mexico.— I agreed with Mr Giddings to speak further with him on this subject.— I had received a Letter from William Ellis of Dedham, with a certificate ofdays service of Peter Dunbar in the revolutionary War; necessary to complete the 6 months required to entitle him to a pension— I intended to take these papers to the Commissioner of pensions this morning, but found I had left the certificate with my list of petitions in my draw at the house— I went and found them there, and brought them home; but it was too late to take them to the Office of the Commissioner of Pensions.

I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. 4. For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.” The discourse was an exposition of this passage of Isaiah by analysis— It is in the form of a dialogue, by question and answer. The Title to this chapter in my Bible is Christ sheweth his power to save—and Mr Daily gave it the same interpretation— He said that th signification of Edom was red earth—and that of Bozrah was affliction or distress—and that it undoubtedly meant Jesus Christ— And the irresistible power of Christ in the gospel. The Sermon was upwards of an hour long, for which he apologized by saying he feared he had detained the auditory longer than they were accustomed to be kept as he came from a part of the Country where the preacher was allowed to discourse just as long as he pleased. He was as vociferous and as hyperbolical as he had been last Sunday. As a specimen of his figures of speech he said it was as extravagant and absurd to think of arresting the prevalence of the kingdom of Christ as it would be to cool the bowels of Aetna with a dew-drop, or to extinguish the internal fires of Vesuvius with a Lady’s smelling bottle— As I was walking home I met in the Avenue Robert Owen, who gave me a small pamphlet containing what he calls his manifesto, that is in three papers published in the National Intelligencer and the Globe his plan for revolutionizing the world. And he said he would bring me to-morrow the book which he lent me once before.— In the afternoon at St. John’s Church Mr Pyne alone, read the evening service for the Sunday after Christmas, and preached from Matthew 25.14. [“]For the kingdom of Heaven is as a man travelling into a far Country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods 15. And unto one he gave five talents to another two; and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.” "

                "text": "30. V:15 Monday  Mr Owen came this morning and brought me again the book which he had lent me before— I had wasted a long hour in reading his manifesto which he gave me yesterday, a farrago of confused, indefinite ideas, the only clear and distinct proposition in which is the formation of a community in or near Washington, to revolutionize the world, from a world of wretchedness and bad principles to a world of wealth ad libitum, of Peace of Plenty and of Love, without religion—to begin which considerable funds will be required, and an appropriation of not less than three Millions of dollars— He borrowed in return my Lecture upon Society and civilization, which he said he regretted not having heard, but which being precisely at the opposite pole from his system, he will estimate, if he reads it, much as I do his manifesto.— The Sheriff of the County had notified me to attend this morning between 10 and 12. O’Clock the grand jury of the criminal court at the City-Hall. I went accordingly, at half-past ten— The court was in session, and they were about to swear in the grand jury— Nineteen men were accordingly sworn, and the judge (Dunlop) made them a very brief charge in a tone of voice so low, that I heard scarcely a word that he said— They then retired to their chamber— I was sworn as a witness by the Clerk of the Court William Brent and the grand-jury immediately afterwards sent for me to their room. I went and related the circumstances of Thomas Sangster’s assault upon me; and having stated the facts I said I was aware, that it was not in my power to remit the breach of the peace, but I might without impropriety say, that so far as personally concerned myself I should be glad to see Mr Sangster discharged without further prosecution—that he had not struck me, nor had I suffered the slightest injury from him— I knew not what was the occasion of his movement against me, but I had received a Letter from him, apologizing for it, expressing great regret at what he had done, and assuring me that it was from a sudden impulse of passion under influences which he could not controul— From that moment all resentment had vanished from my mind— The Letter was in the style and language of a Gentleman— I understood he had been an Officer in the army, and had faithfully served his country. I should therefore deeply regret if he should be severely dealt with for his mere attempt upon me.— In the house the morning was consumed in a debate upon a Resolution of C. J. Ingersoll from the Committee of foreign Affairs for having a map of the United States engraved for the use of the members, which was carried— The death of W. S. Fulton Senator from Arkansas was announced and the house adjourned. "

                "text": "31. III:30— V:30. Tuesday.  The closing day of every year is the special season for retrospection, for thanksgiving, for self-examination; for repentance— It bears every year with increasing gravity upon the conscience and at the stage of life which I have attained, every year with more irresistible demonstration of the decay of body and mind— I am sinking under them—yet I struggle to keep my head above the surface of the flood— My last nights repose was disturbed— I know not from what cause. I rose between 3 and 4 with an aching head; and returned for two more hours of waking dreams.— Mr Daniel R. Tilden a member of the House of Representatives from Ohio, brought me some days since a small album, with a note saying that he had purchased it for his little daughter Sarah, and requesting me to write something in it. These requests thicken upon me greatly to my annoyance; and the time they consume, and the impotence of mind which they disclose is a continual source of self reproach and mortification— A Sonnet for Miss Tilden’s Album occupied the morning— At the house John W. Tibbatts asked leave to introduce a Bill to authorise the People of Texas to form a State Constitution of Government, and for the admission of the State into the Union—and a joint Resolution pledging the protection of the United States to the People of Texas till the question of re-annexation shall be settled. Barnard objected to the introduction of these measures without previous notice, whereupon Tibbatts turned his motion into a notice for to-morrow or some subsequent day.— James E. Belser of Alabama gave notice of his intention to move a joint Resolution for the annexation of Texas to the United States.— George S. Houston of Alabama moved a suspension of the rules for a Resolution to cease debate on the land graduation bill in committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and to report it to the house this afternoon—but the vote on his motion by tellers was 49 to 74 no second.— The Committees were then called for Reports, and many were made for notice hereafter— Haralson, chairman of the military Committee reported in favour of two National foundries— Charles J. Ingersoll chairman of the Committee of foreign Affairs attempted to get entered on the Journal that he had presented a report and bill in favour of Ledyard when he had neither report nor bill prepared. He said indisposition had prevented him. Hannibal Hamlin of Maine moved a reconsideration of yesterdays vote, ordering a 20 inch map of the United States for the use of the members— The vote was reconsidered, and the Resolution laid on the table— Walter Hellen and Mary Louisa went to an Evening party at Commander Wilkes’s. Mrs Smith left us. [symbols]. "
