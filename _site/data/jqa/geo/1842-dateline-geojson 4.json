                "text": "2. V:15 Sunday  When I rose this morning there was a large circle round the moon, portending foul weather, but not followed this day by its usual consequences. At the second presbyterian church, Mr Clark preached from Job 30.23. [“]For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.”— A discourse upon Death; always appropriate—specially suited to the commencement of the year, and at every return of the day more impressive to all who like me have long passed through the turnpike gate of three score and ten, and am already coming to the half way stile, between that and four-score— It is one of the imperfections of my nature that I do not realize as I ought the certain approach of death by a diligent and faithful improvement of the still diminishing sands of the glass. Mr Clark’s address to the aged part of his auditory was earnest and solemn—but how often have I said to myself all and more than all that he said to me— The spirit is willing; but the flesh is weak— Oh! how weak! how impotent! Mr Clark gave notice that divine service would continue to be regularly performed in this church three times every Sunday, and announced Lectures and prayer meetings, for almost every day of the coming week. My nephew, the passed midshipman Joseph Harrod Adams dined with us. At St. John’s church, Mr Hawley read the evening service for the second Sunday after Christmas, with the collect for the day of the Circumcision.— Mr Humphreys of Annapolis preached from 2. Kings 8.12 [“]And Hazael said, why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel.”— He omitted the specifications in the remainder of the verse, and began by remarking how painful the office of the hebrew prophets must have been. Mr Humphreys is an elderly man—grave, sensible, cold—of the old English, episcopal school— No northern mail this evening, and of course no letter from Boston— I am drawing to a close of reading Coll Trumbull’s autobiography, and am diverted by a sudden patriotic and cosmopolitan impulse, which seized him in the Spring of 1799, to spur up the United States, to plunge into War, to emancipate the Spanish American Colonies. This was the Miranda project, though the Colonel neither names nor alludes to him— Washington’s answer was a damper, and should have made the umpire commissioner, and revolutionary painter, somewhat distrustful of his third capacity of a far seeing Statesman, and volunteer liberator.

The Northern Mail did not arrive at its usual time last Evening and we received no letter from Boston; but it came this morning with a letter from Harriet Welsh, dated Friday, the last day of the year, and full of cheering hope, that my Son’s child Henry, is convalescent; and may yet by the mercy of God be spared— One Calendar month has expired since he was seized with the scarlet fever, only five days after I with his father had left him in full health; one of the charmingest children that ever breathed the air of heaven— Oh! may divine providence preserve him for long and useful life.— At the house William Cost Johnson came out with a hard studied, Southern whig, jesuitical, slave-breeder speech of an hour and a half, for the reference of the tariff question to the Committee of Ways and Means— The completest specimen of his trickish propensities that I had ever heard— Almost all his talent consists of trickery— This time his cunning device was discomfited. As soon as he finished John C. Clark, moved the previous question, after a short preamble; and after withdrawing it for a few minutes to allow Lewis Williams to give in brief his reasons for voting for it.— the question of seconding the call was after a call of the house, carried by tellers 88 to 88, decided by the casting vote of the Speaker— On the question shall the main question be now put the vote by yeas and nays was 101 to 97. Cave Johnson moved to adjourn, but on a call for the yeas and nays withdrew the motion. Fernando Wood of New-York moved to adjourn, and after eight or ten all nays were called was permitted by general consent to withdraw his motion—a crafty modification of Fillmore’s motion of reference to the committee of manufactures moved by Samson Mason, was accepted by Fillmore— Rhett withdrew his proposed amendment— The yeas and nays on Atherton’s amendment to strike out the manufactures and insert the ways and means, were 95 to 104. the loco-foco democracy of the North and west voting with the Slave breeding South, but the whole vote of Pennsylvania without exception being for the manufactures.— The Report from the Secretary of the Treasury, in answer to Cushing’s call relating to the Coast survey was then communicated by the Speaker to the house. I moved the printing of the same number of extra copies for Mr Hassler as were given him on a former occasion, but Cushing and Cave Johnson cavilled off the question till to-morrow. Motions to adjourn— I intreated the house to pass the residue of Fillmore’s Resolutions, distributing the President’s Message among the Committees which they did; and one additional moved by Cooper, of the Indian Affairs. It was 3. O’Clock, but Clio had stopped at two. William Jagger was here this Evening. "

Johnson and Granger— Absent Rhett, who had given notice that he would call up for consideration so much of the Presidents message as relates to the claim of the British Government to the right of searching American vessels on the coast of Africa— He has probably been better advised since the last meeting of the Committee— Cushing was instructed to report to the house two bills, reciprocating the suspension of discriminating tonnage duties on certain Spanish vessels, and on vessels from Cayenne— I presented for consideration the Message of 19. July 1841. and the Letter and Documents from the Secretary of State, urging the re-enactment of the Law of 10. March 1838. to secure the peace of the Canada frontier— I mentioned the interview I had had with the Secretary of State on the subject; and the earnest wish expressed by him, and felt, as he assured me, by the President for the revival of the act— But there was a repugnance apparently unanimous in the Committee, against it.— After full discussion it was postponed.— In the house, the question of reference to a select committee of the petitions and remonstrances against the gag-rule, came up, but, by the shameless prevarications of the Speaker and of about twenty members of the northern democracy, it was laid on the table, which on the 14th. of December had been refused by yeas and nays 87 to 92.— The baseness of these proceedings is too severe a trial of my temper— Oh! for restraining grace—for inflexible firmness—for untiring perseverance—for suavity of manner, and for self-controul.— The first vote now was declared 115 to 84 for laying on the table— I insisted on the taking the question upon each separate petition The second vote to lay on the table was 103 to 87. Roosevelt did not vote— Stanly moved that according to the rule he should be compelled to vote, and put him to shame— The Speaker said the rule required him to vote; but Stanly said he would not press the matter, and he did not vote—but Stanly called the yeas and nays again on the next petition, and Roosevelt then voted in the affirmative, the vote then was 107 to 83.— The question was then taken separately but without yeas and nays upon five or six other petitions, when Arnold started up, and moved a reconsideration of the vote yesterday to refer the tariff part of the message to the committee on manufactures, and began a speech against Burke of New-Hampshire He was soon called to order; and a most disorderly debate on order, ensued, cut short only by a motion of Barton of Virginia to adjourn which was carried. Walking home I met Mr Rives the Senator from Virginia, and Chairman of the Senates Committee of foreign Affairs, who walked home with me. "

                "text": "5. IV:15— Wednesday  Morning visit from Mr Ruggles, one of the Canal Commissioners of the State of New-York. He comes here now, in connection with a plan, concerning which I received some time since, a Letter from Governor Seward by which the general Government, may relieve the States from the burden of their debts incurred by undertakings of internal improvement, by purchasing a perpetual right of free passage over all the railroads in the United States for the mail, and for military purposes.— Long and free conversation with Mr Ruggles, disclosing my apprehensions that this measure cannot be carried through as of any efficiency to relieve the States, and that no measure devised by the present Administration will restore the level of exchanges, the stability of the currency or the sufficiency of the revenue for the expenditures— I said that increased taxation by impost; the assumption of the State debts, and a National Bank on the old platform, were the three measures indispensable for the payment of the public debt, the restoration of public credit, and the punctual payment of the expenses of the Government— Neither of these measures will be adopted by the general Government, and the present President is following the path of his two immediate predecessors downward to universal bankruptcy— At the house, after the reading of the Journal I moved that it should be amended by striking out the instructions which I had proposed on the 14th. of December to give to the select committee which I then moved to raise, but which instructions the Speaker had then decided to be not in order, and I had withdrawn them— This motion raised a debate of an hour and a half in which I proved beyond all question the falsification of the Journal and the prevarications of the Speaker; but Meriwether finally moved to lay my motion to amend the Journal on the table and carried it by yeas and nays 99 to 78.— Then came up Bowne’s appeal from the Speaker’s decision allowing Arnold to speak in violation of the rules, in reply to Burke and Eastman. After much debate, the yeas and nays being called I rose at the call of my name and was assigning my reasons for not sustaining the decision of the Speaker, when he called me to order; the appeal not being debatable; thoughe had in the hurry of yesterday decided otherwise— I voted against his decision which was reversed 67 to 89. Arnold said to me, Et tu Brute! and after some struggling withdrew his motion for reconsideration, and the house adjourned. Thomas B. J. Frye dined with us— Evening visits from Dennis M’Curdy and William Jagger. Encouraging Letter from Charles’s wife. "

Thursday  Mr Espy the storm-breeder, who had notified me at Boston, that he would be here at the beginning of the year, punctual to his time appeared yesterday at the house and requested me to fix a time for an interview. I appointed 9 O’Clock this morning.— He left with me a paper, exposing his three wishes of appropriations by Congress for his benefit, about as rational as those of Hans Carvel and his wife— The man is methodically Monomaniac, and the dimension of his organ of self-esteem have been swollen to the size of a goitre, by a report from a committee of the National Institute of France endorsing all his crackbrained discoveries in meteorology. I told him with all possible civility that it would be of no use to memorialize the house of Representatives in behalf of his three wishes. He said he had thoughts of addressing the Senate, and asked if they should pass a bill in his favour whether I would support it in the House— I said if the Senate should pass such a bill, I would do all that I could for him in the house— There was an attempt in the house this morning to introduce petitions, but the Speaker declared the 30 days expired; a motion was made to suspend the rules, by Dean of Ohio, for him to present a petition, modified at the request of Goggin, for the reception of Petitions generally—the motion just failed 100 to 52. The Committees were called for Reports. Saltonstall from the Committee of Manufactures requested a Resolution to authorize that Committee to take testimony respecting the tariff and its operation upon the interests of the Country— This started at once the tariff question with all its inflammatory matter— It was debated an hour and a half, till Fillmore called for the orders of the day; that is the Bill to authorize the issuing of Treasury Notes, which started again in substance the same debate— Wise moved an amendment to repeal the distributing Sections of the last Session’s land Bill— M’Keon had given notice yesterday that he should move that same thing, and now claimed his thunder, but Wise would not yield it— He made a second furious anti protective speech— Fillmore implored Wise to withdraw his amendment but he refused— The debate soon became entangled and Weller moved the Committee to rise; which was carried 83 to 64— The report from the State Department to the call for the census aggregates was received, and referred to the apportionment committee, to determine, whether it shall be printed— Mr Weems was here this Evening and read to me a Letter to Mr Webster—unanswered— I advised him to see Mr Horace Everett.

Friday—  Mr Minott Thayer called on me this morning. he has come for the second time, all the way from Braintree, and now in the dead of winter to use his influence and bespeak mine to save his friend Hart from being turned out of the office of the naval constructor at the Navy yard at Brooklyn, New-York— I told him I had received the Letter of his nephew Ebenezer Thayer at New-York, enquiring whether I would advise his coming on for the benefit of Mr Hart, but had been unable to answer the letter on account of Mr Upshur’s absence when I called at the Navy Department— Mr Thayer promised to dine with me to-morrow. At the house, after the surreptitious creeping in of several petitions, and resolutions, by connivance of the Speaker with particular members till some one calls for the orders of the day, Payne of Alabama presented a petition to the reception of which I objected—he moved the suspension of the rules; I said if he would move it for the general call of the States for petitions, I would vote for it—others urged him to the same, and he modified his motion accordingly; which was carried 110 to 42. Giddings enquired if the unsettled question raised by W. Cost Johnson upon an abolition petition laid over on the 14th. of last Month would not now first come up. The Speaker said no— All the rules were now suspended; and he must begin the call at the Territory of Iowa and proceed northward— When it came to the turn of Ohio Giddings presented a succession of petitions, upon which Wise and W. Cost Johnson, and Campbell of South-Carolina, raised the question of reception, and then moved to lay the question of reception on the table, and when they could not make the question of reception they moved to lay the petition on the table; and in every case the motion to lay on the table was carried the Northern democracy dropping in one by one into the ranks of the slave-breeders.— Bowne and Gordon of New-York were thus whipped in this day, as Roosevelt had been by Stanly two days ago.— Upon one of the questions, started by Campbell, a question upon the reception of a petition which the Speaker had decided to be receivable, and then a motion to lay on the table his own question of reception, I refused to vote; and after Bowne and Gordon had been disciplined Wise called on the Speaker to apply the same screw to me— The Speaker did not hear him. Mathiot repeated the demand— Stanly moved to postpone that question to the first Monday in December—for they had tried me upon that question before, and they would get nothing by trying it again— So the call for petitions proceeded till they came to Kentucky, when on a petition for the repeal of the bankrupt law, debate lowered and the house adjourned— "

Mr Clark the new Minister of the second Presbyterian church called on me again this morning to repeat the invitation to me to deliver a lecture of the course commenced for the benefit to that Church, and which is to be continued weekly through the winter— I declined, as I had done before, and have been compelled to do in many other cases— At the house the suspension of the rules, for the purpose of receiving petitions for the whole day was occupied in prescribing the bankrupt law’s repeal. Garrett Davis had yesterday presented a petition from Kentucky for its repeal, and Cravens of Indiana had moved its reference to the Committee on the judiciary, with instructions to report a repealing bill— This was somewhat startling, and brought up a snarl, in the midst of which the house adjourned— This day various expedients were tried to get rid of the instructions, but in vain. The yeas and nays were taken, times without number; beside a call of the house, which consumed an hour—all would not avail— The reference with the instructions was carriedImmediately after which Thomas F. Marshall presented a petition from Louisville, which he said was nine feet long, and moved its reference to the judiciary Committee with instructions to report the repealing act, forthwith— This word was peculiarly obnoxious to the whigs because it was used in the instructions to the Committee of Elections in the last Congress to report on the New-Jersey case— In courtesy to this whig scruple, Marshall drop’d his word forthwith, first for Monday and then for Tuesday next—which was carried— The whole of this process was accomplished by the coalition of Clay, Tyler and mock democracy votes— And is the first symptom of a new party combination against Northern interests— Its first object is the prostration, ruin and dismissal of Webster— As soon as the vote was completed, Gentry of Tennessee moved a reconsideration, to prevent its being made by any one else, and the repeal of the bankrupt act was clenched— Campbell of South-Carolina then observed that it was the 8th. of January, and moved an adjournment which was carried.Messrs. Gates, Leavitt, Weld and Thayer dined with us; all Tetotallers— Rechabites who drink no wine. In further improvement of which Mr Weld announced himself as a Grahamite, and ate no animal food. Mrs Smith was confined to her chamber, and Mrs John Adams came not to table— The Gentlemen are also abolitionists except Thayer who is all things to all men— He spent the Evening with me as did Mr Simmons of Roxbury, his fellow traveller— "

Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.”— These words explicitly indicate the spiritual character of that regeneration, which Jesus had declared to Nicodemus was indispensable for entrance into the kingdom of God— This doctrine of regeneration with its inseparable attendant the atonement seem to form the sum total of Calvinistic preaching.— It suited— Mr Thayer, one of whose glories is that there are in Braintree three churches, all orthodox and no more— He thought Mr Moore’s Sermon sensible, and judicious, and guessed he was a clever man— The usual notices were given of three services at the church every Sunday, and daily lectures during the week; one of which weekly, is upon Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress. Mr Thayer came again at 3. O’Clock, and went with me to St. John’s church, where Mr Hawley read the evening service for the first Sunday after the epiphany, and preached from Genesis 28.15. “And behold,— I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.” Mr Thayer liked the discourse of Mr Hawley very well, and thought him a solid man— He thought also that Mr Wolcott, the Minister of the episcopal church at Quincy was a smart man. Mr Thayer wanted also to call on the Secretary of War, to interpose in behalf of a poor woman at Braintree, whose husband is in trouble for desertion from the army; and he intimated a wish that I would give him a Letter of introduction to the Secretary of War— Without refusing, I did not comply with this request, humane and benevolent as it was—believing that Mr Spencer would not be gratified or edified by officious interference to screen from punishment a deserter, because it is afflictive to his wife. Mrs John Adams, and her daughter Mary-Louisa spent the Evening at General Jesup’s— My wife received this evening a Letter from Harriet Welsh, with still encouraging accounts of the convalescence of the dear boy Henry.— A Letter from Dr Mease at Philadelphia, brought the painful intelligence of Judge Hopkinson’s suffering a sudden stroke of palsy.

                "text": "10. V:15. Monday  My catarrhal cough returned yesterday, and for what am I good for the rest of the winter? At the entrance of the Representative hall, I met William Jagger, who said he wanted dreadfully to have a talk with me; and I told him to come to my house at 7. O’Clock this Evening. The Revd. John Nowland Maffit an Irish Methodist, celebrated and notorious made this morning in the house the shortest prayer that I ever heard in public— He arrived here last Saturday Evening from Boston where a Society has been formed, and engaged him to preach to them for five years— He preached yesterday in the Hall of the House. This was by the rules the second bi-weekly day for the presentation of Resolutions—but the rules have been four days suspended for the reception of Petitions— This was the unfinished business of this morning; but Mr Fillmore, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, with grievous lamentations over the bankruptcy and beggary of the Treasury, moved again to suspend the rules, to go into Committee of the whole upon the state of the Union, to take up the bill to authorize the issue of Treasury Notes; and this motion was carried by yeas and nays,Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the Chair— Wise withdrew the amendment that he had offered of a second section repealing the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands— But it was then moved by Weller of Ohio.—The Chairman decided that it was not in order, and Weller appealed—after a debate of an hour or more the question was taken by Tellers and the chairman’s decision was sustained. Cooper of Pennsylvania then opened a battery against the bill itself, the issue of treasury notes.— He poured down a shower of sarcasms upon Tyler’s courtship of the damsel loco-focoism—which brought up Wise in passionate flat contradiction, and Proffit in a foolish rhodomontade of Tyler’s appeal to the people— Poor Proffit was crucified by Thomas F. Marshall who last week took the temperance pledge, and this day, perfectly sober made the most splendid and powerful speech of the Session. Underwood then took the floor—the Committee rose and the house adjourned— I notified the members of the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest, to meet Wednesday morning— At 7 O’Clock this evening Jagger came and spent the evening with me in enquiries historical.

Absent Hunter W. Cost Johnson and Proffit— Rhett reported the Bill in favour of Alexander Hammett the Consul at Naples, which has been reported several times before, and after some discussion, was directed to report the same to the house.— I communicated the Letter and enclosures received from Arthur Middleton but the Committee thought they had no authority to act without a reference from the house. Rhett produced his Resolution of enquiry to ascertain what instructions have been given, to the new Minister in England, upon the question relating to the search by British Cruizers of American Merchant vessels on the coast of Africa— After some discussion, upon taking the vote Gilmer and Cushing voted for the Resolution Everett and Granger against it Rhett said that having offered the Resolution, he declined voting upon it— If he had voted for it, and I had voted against it, he would still have failed— I voted for it; willing to indulge him although perceiving the insidious object of enquiry, and trusting quite as much as they deserved his professions of not wishing to interfere with the negotiations of the Executive— I hold it just and politic to leave the initiative of debate in the house on this subject to the Slave holders— There was some conversation upon the report prepared by Mr Everett on the claim of Margaret Meade, which he had lent me, and I had read— I did not concur in its conclusions, and noticed parts of the report, from which I dissented— Mr Everett defended them— No decision— At the House after a claim by Thomas F. Marshall, of preference for the order to the Committee on the judiciary to report this day a bill to repeal the bankrupt act; and some confused discussion the Speaker decided against it— That the first order of the day was to receive Petitions. Marshall appealed, and called the previous question the decision of the Speaker was sustained by yeas and nays 117 to 84. Then Fillmore moved a suspension of the rules to take up the Treasury note Bill, carried 151 to 53, and then 106 to 103. to take up the Bill.— Underwood made his speech, and offered his amendment— Gamble and Fessenden made speeches in favour of the Bill, and Dean of Ohio, a furious one against it, and against the whig party so ludicrous that he went on for at least an hour amid continual shouts of laughter— John G. Floyd followed on the same side, but after several abortive motions to adjourn, and to call the house, adjourned about 4. by yeas and nays 62 to 54— Mr and Mrs David Hoffman, with their daughter spent the Evening here.

Ingersoll,—absent Hunter, Houston, and Bowne, the last of whom I had not been able personally to notify; he having been yesterday and the day before detained from the house by indisposition— I read the Commission of the members; the reference to the Committee of the part of the President’s Message, relating to the Smithsonian fund; and that part of the Message itself— After much desultory conversation the Committee agreed to meet next Wednesday Morning at ten O’Clock— At the house, Fillmore moved a suspension of the rules, to offer a Resolution to take the Treasury Note Bill out of Committee at 2 to-morrow afternoon—much disorderly debate yeas and nays 119 to 65. not two thirds— Fillmore moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—yeas and nays, 105 to 92.— Hopkins in the chair— John G. Floyd, a County Court lawyer, from Utica, New-York, finished the speech he had begun yesterday against the Bill, or rather against the whig party—he said he would take not more than 20 minutes, and took 40—all sheer growling against the whigs— He was followed by Arnold of Tennessee, nearly three hours without check, controul or interruption A general retaliation upon all the modern democracy for all their ribaldry against the whigs; but his declamation was intermingled with much lofty sentiment and much solid argument.— After he finished, the house fell again into confusion— Fillmore moved again to suspend the rules for his resolution, and failed again for want of two-thirds— The committee refused to rise and then rose— Joseph R. Ingersoll took the floor, and after sundry frivolous and dilatory movements the house adjourned about a quarter before 5.— Miss Freeman and Thomas B. J. Frye dined with us.

I called this morning at the Department of State, with a Letter communicating to him the resolution of the Committee, direction their chairman to ascertain, whether any new correspondence or instructions have occurred since the President’s annual message relating to the search by British Cruizers of American vessels on the Coast of Africa— He read the Letter and said nothing— I enquired whether the report on the call of the house last winter, for documents concerning our relations with the Republic of Hayti, was to be expected soon. He said it was in a course of preparation— I told him I should probably move a call for Stevenson’s Letter to Commodore Hull, and also on the Navy department, for the proceedings of the Court of enquiry and Court Martial for the recent trial of Captain Bolton. He said nothing— I observed that the state of our affairs generally seemed unpleasant and that there was every prospect of the bankrupt law—he made no reply— I said difficulties seemed to multiply upon us— Yes! said he—difficulties on all sides— He was evidently absorbed in deep agitation of mind— Mr Forward the Secretary of the Treasury came in just at this moment with Mr Daniel Raymond, and I left them. My next call was on the Postmaster General, with the Letters of Mr George Bliss and Samuel H. Walley— There were several persons with him, among the rest a young man named Lyman, who announced himself to me, as the agent of the New-York and Erie rail-road company, who had come to contract for carrying the mail on that road, which he said would be finished in the course of the present year. Mr Wickliffe read to me an answer he had written to Mr R. C. Winthrop containing his ultimatum offer to the Western rail-road company for carrying the Mail; concerning which Mr Bliss had written to me. Mr Wickliffe gave me also a written assurance that he had determined not to remove the Postmaster at Randolph— At the house Committee of the whole on the state of the Union on the Treasury note-bill Hopkins in the chair— The two brothers Ingersoll made long speeches on the two sides of the question; which was further most tediously debated till near seven in the Evening—the bill was then at last reported with two or three Amendments to the house, and Fillmore immediately moved the previous question; but without taking it the house adjourned and I walked home— The last Speakers against the Bill were Thompson of Mississippi, and Gordon of Delhi, New-York— Thompson boggled a defence of the State of Mississippi, for repudiating or in other words refusing to pay the part of her debt, which he said she had never contracted— Agreed with Gates and Giddings to meet Saturday Morning.

I called this morning at the Department of the Treasury, and requested of the Secretary a statement of the present condition of the Smithsonian fund, and copies of the State Bonds in which it has been invested for the information of the Committee to which the subject has been referred by the house— I enquired also when the report upon the debts of the States called for by Resolution of the house, might be expected.— He said he had written to the Governors of the several States, and had received answers from some, and not from others— The answers from the heaviest States were received. And he directed the chief Clerk M’Clintock Young to write again to write to the States whence there are as yet no answers— At the house the previous question had been moved last Night by Fillmore upon the Treasury Note Bill— It was now seconded and taken— The amendments moved by Arnold, Everett and Underwood were rejected— That moved by T. W. Gilmer was carried by yeas and nays 105 to 102— The Bill was then passed without yeas and nays, to the third reading—whereupon Romulus M. Saunders, enquired of the Speaker whether the previous question of the passage to the third reading was not spent— The Speaker said it was— Upon which Saunders moved to recommit the Bill, with instructions to report a suspension of the land distribution bill, and the application of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the redemption of the Treasury Note Bills.— Fillmore moved the previous question which cut off Saunders’s motion, and it was carried. The bill was then passed by yeas and nays 129 to 86. with the party vote on both sides, splintered as I have seen an Oak of the forest by a thunder-bolt. Giddings chairman of the Committee of claims, now intreated the house to take up private business, according to the rules, but the house adhered to the suspension of the rules and the call of the States for the reception of Petitions, arrested at Kentucky.— Pendleton of Ohio, requested permission out of his turn to present two remonstrances from Cincinnati against the repeal of the bankrupt law— I claimed the same privilege as did several other members without success— Giddings’s motion to postpone the reception of petitions, and take up private business was rejected by yeas and nays 89 to 117— On the call for Petitions John B. Thompson, presented sundry Resolutions of the Legislature of Kentucky, quite belligerent against Mexico, concerning a recent expedition from Texas to Santa-Fe, which has fallen into the hands of the Mexicans, and been somewhat roughly treated— In this expedition a son of Leslie Coombs of Kentucky, a mere youth of seventeen, was an adventurer and the Resolutions of the Legislature of Kentucky declare that protection is due to all, and every the humblest citizen of the republic whether at home or abroad— There are four Resolutions with a preamble all of the same stamp— Thompson moved their reference to the Committee of foreign relations, and that they be printed which was ordered— Then Thomas F. Marshall offered the same set of Resolutions, and moved their reference to the Committee of Foreign Relations with instructions to collect and report to the house information respecting this Texian expedition to Santa Fe— Fernando Wood of New-York moved to add the same instructions to the Committee respecting the American Prisoners in Van Diemen’s land.— Everett suggested that the information should be obtained, not by instructions to the Committee, but by a call upon the Executive— Marshall modified his resolution accordingly and Wood his amendment, and they were adopted— Linn of Schenectady New-York having declared his intention to debate the question about the Van Diemens land prisoners, but finally withdrawing his objection— The Speaker presented a petition from Richmond County Kentucky— Briggs moved its reference to the judiciary Committee, with instructions to report a Bill to amend the Bankrupt Act of the last Session, by including money-corporations within its provisions. long debate and puzzle whether these instructions would interfere with those already given to the Committee to report a bill of repeal— Cave Johnson moves to lay the petition, reference and instructions all on the table; and after some time spent in wriggling round the question as usual in such cases it was taken by yeas and nays and by a vote of 100 to 101. decided not to be laid upon the table— The question came back upon Briggs’s motion of reference with instructions which Briggs modified at the request of Clifford of Maine, who after thus taking him in voted against his resolution— Gentry moved an adjournment, at half past 3 which was carried, by yeas and nays 101 to 88. I walked home and stop’d on my way at Mr Montandon’s and left with him again my Chronometer to be regulated— Minott Thayer spent the Evening here "

With my wife, and Mrs John Adams, I attended public worship this morning, at the Hall of the house of Representatives, where it was performed by the Rev’d John Newland Maffit, an Irish Methodist, Chaplain of the house, and a very celebrated and notorious preacher.— He is a man of small stature, from 45 to 50 years of age, with a countenance indicating more intelligence than humility or rectitude— He was bred a small tradesman in Dublin came to this country, an oratorical adventurer nearly thirty years ago, has always been a popular preacher, but has lived in sundry parts of the Union, and no where without reproach— The hall and all the galleries were crowded to overflowing; we pressed in towards the Speakers chair with difficulty and obtained seats only by the politeness of strangers who gave us theirs and insisted upon our taking them— We found him reading the 53d. Chapter of Isaiah the episcopal first morning of lesson of the day.— He reads well; his voice is fine—his articulation theatrically slow and distinct; his pronunciation remarkably good, with the occasional use of a vulgarism, which he has not yet succeeded in unlearning. His discourse was from Isaiah 55.8. [“]For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. 9. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts—” The Sermon, had no logical connection with the text— It consisted of a multitudinous collection of anecdotes, intermingled with pious declamation, about the creation of the world the life and adventures of Moses, of Joseph, of David, and his fight with Goliah, of Jesus Christ born in the stable of an inn, of the fishermen his first disciples; of Columbus and the discovery of America, of Sir Isaac Newton, and the fall of the apple, of the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, of the Independence of the United States and the prayers of Washington and Wellington of Sunday Schools, Bible Societies, Missionary Societies, Temperance reform and every thing save anti-slavery and abolition— He gave notice that this Sermon was a sequel to that which he had preached last Sunday; and that he should preach again next Sunday on the same subject; from the text—canst thou by searching find out God? &c. The Sermon occupied an hour and a quarter and rivetted the attention of the whole auditory— He concluded by singing four Stanza’s of a methodist hymn, and then pronounced the benediction. After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read Evening prayers for the second Sunday after the Epiphany, and preached from Isaiah—but I forget the chapter and verse— Letter this evening from Dr James Mease Philadelphia. Judge Hopkinson died at 3. yesterday morning. 71. "

Mr Radcliff came this morning and communicated to me the steps that he has taken here in pursuance of his commission as confidential agent of the new State of the Isthmus— He presented his commission to Mr Webster, Secretary of State and left it with him— And on the 31st. of last Month he addressed to him a memorial, claiming the recognition by the Government of the United States, of the Isthmus as an Independent State, and setting forth the grounds and circumstances of this claim—together with a note of the special objects desired for adjustment of intercourse between the Isthmus and this Country. Mr Radcliff left with me copies of these papers for my perusal, and had a long conversation with me upon the course that it may be proper for him to pursue in execution of his Commission— His memoir is well written, and sets in a clear light the actual position of the Isthmus and the force of its claims to recognition— He said that the President and Mr Webster both admitted the high importance of this subject; but Mr Webster said perhaps before the formal recognition, it might be thought necessary to send a confidential agent to the Isthmus to make report of its present condition, as had been done in the case of Texas. Mr Radcliff will soon call again.— Mr Rhind came with Mr Hawley an old friend of his, and told me he had a claim upon this Government, which would come before the Committee of Foreign Affairs— Rhind was Andrew Jackson’s plenipotentiary to negotiate a Treaty with the Sublime Porte.— What his claim is he did not explain. At the house, the whole day was again consumed, in driving through the Bill to repeal the Bankrupt Law of the last Session, which was finally accomplished by yeas and nays 126 to 94. The process was harsh, precipitous, and unrelenting— Led on wholly by the Kentucky Claymen— Granger alone succeeded amidst the continual motions for the previous question, to crowd in a short Speech against the Bill— Roosevelt made an attempt to present petitions for and against the repeal, but was frustrated by the rude and arbitrary violence of the Speaker.— I demanded that Roosevelt’s point of order should be reduced to writing—he refused.— I therefore refused to vote on the question— Meriwether moved I should be compelled to vote, but was not seconded; and I thanked him— Adjourned about 5— Mr Gurley the Colozinationist was here this morning— Messrs. Belcher, Espy, Brackenridge in the Evening; and Dr Thomas who came to visit Mrs Smith feverish with the influenza. "

Cost Johnson, and Rhett who came in after the Committee had adjourned— The answer of the Secretary of State to Rhett’s resolution of enquiry was read—relating to the visitation and search question— The answer is that no additional correspondence has been received, and no Instructions yet given to Mr Edward Everett, but that there will be soon.— When Rhett came in I read the answer to him and he said it was satisfactory.— No other business of moment was considered but H. Everett gave notice that at the next Meeting he should move to take up the claim of Mrs Margaret Meade. At the house the day was occupied in calling the States for Petitions— The progress made was northward from Kentucky to New-York— The delay was chiefly caused by the presentation of petitions, abolition, anti-slavery and for and against the repeal of the bankrupt law. after much desultory discussion, these last were all referred to the Committee on the judiciary— The abolition petitions which came within the gag-rule were all quietly excluded; and every anti-slavery petition which could not be disposed of thus, when presented, Wise, Hopkins, and Campbell of South-Carolina, interchangeably, move the question of reception, and then move to lay the question of reception on the table— The yeas and nays were taken several times, and the vote to lay on the table always prevailed— At last Granger presented a petition praying Congress to secure by Law to the free citizens of the United States, the benefits of the Post-Office— The question of reception, and the motion to lay on the table followed, and Granger called for the yeas and nays.— This question brought the practice of excluding petitions one step beyond all former precedent and Mallory of Virginia moved to adjourn, though it was but just after 3. O’Clock The adjournment was carried by Tellers— Joseph R. Ingersoll succeeded in getting sundry petitions against the repeal of the Bankrupt act, referred to the Committee on the judiciary, referred with instructions to enquire into the expediency of reporting a bankrupt bill free from the defects and supplying the deficiencies of the one just repealed— Sundry other Resolutions were offered, but objected against and not received— Mr Augustus Young a member of the house from Vermont and Mr Whitcomb, now a Clerk in the Treasury Department, spent the Evening with me, in general conversation upon political subjects— Mr Young feels deeply the degradation of the free and especially the eastern portion of the Union, by subserviency to the insolent domination of the Southern, slave traders and slave-breeders; but he sees and I see no prospect of breaking the yoke in my life-time.

Present Adams, Habersham, Underwood, Randall, C. J. Ingersoll, Houston and Bowne— Absent Truman Smith and Hunter— I had found in the chamber of the Committee of manufactures the book containing the minutes of the proceedings of the former Committees on this subject. The last entry upon which was of 15— January 1840. My report of that Committee with an amended bill to incorporate the trustees of the fund was made on the 5th of March 1840. since which nothing has been done by Congress concerning it.— The Bill N. 1. of the House Bills, remained on the Calendar through the whole remainder of the 26th. Congress 1st and 2d. Sessions, and was never reached in the ordinary business of the house— There was no Committee appointed at the second Session— None at the late special Session, first of the 27th. Congress, and in the mean time the funds invested in bonds of the State of Arkansas, have depretiated at least fifty per cent— I now stated to the Committee that I had called upon the Secretary of the Treasury for a statement of the present condition of the fund, which he had promised, but had not yet furnished me— I recapitulated again the proceedings of the former Committees, and gave copies of my last report to those members of the Committee who desired them— Habersham presented a Letter from James F. Espy proposing that a portion of the fund should be appropriated for simultaneous meteorological observations all over the union with him for central National meteorologist stationed at Washington with a comfortable salary.— Adjourned to next Wednesday at 10. A.M.— Immediately after the reading of the Journal in the house, Benjamin A. Bidlack of Wilkesbarre Pennsylvania, announced the death of his colleague Davis Dimock junr. of Montrose with an appropriate eulogy, the chief fault of which was that he had not gotten it well by heart; with the usual resolutions to wear crape 30 days and to adjourn— After which I went into the Senate chamber, and gave to our Senator Rufus Choate an abolition petition to that body from Hingham to present— I found George Evans of Maine discoursing upon the Treasury Note Bill— When he finished Buchanan announced the death of Dimock, and the Senate adjourned. Dr Hall was here this Evening. "

Morning visit from Dr Todsen; to solicit again my recommendation of him for an appointment of clerk in the Department of State—where he says there is shortly to be a vacancy, by the dismission of a young man named Vail—a very worthy person, but who has fallen into habits of intemperance— Mr Thomson, a son of judge Smith Thompson is now my near neighbour— He came to speak of a claim upon the Mexican Government, which he is prosecuting before the joint commission now sitting in this city, but which is to terminate on the 25th. of next Month. Mr Thomson fears that the Commissioners will not have time to go through with the examination of his claim, and I believe the commission itself and the convention by which it was instituted, a fraud to breed a War with Mexico—and the annexation of Texas to this Union— Robert Reeves is the man whom the late Secretary of the Treasury Ewing removed, as keeper of the building, and who then lent me a manuscript of his composition, upon controverted politics which I had not time to read— He now brought me another manuscript upon Calvinism, Arminianism and Transubstantiation, which I shall be equally unable to appretiate— Mr Radcliff came and took back his memorial and statement which he had left with me, to read— He has seen the President, but with a crowd of other visitors, so that he had scarcely an opportunity of three minutes of private conversation—but the President told him, that his proposals as agent for the State of the Isthmus were under intense consideration— Mr Radcliff thinks the President will now only send an Agent to the Isthmus— I accompanied Mr Thayer to the War Department to introduce him at his reiterated and urgent request to the Secretary, John C. Spencer.— He was not there, but I introduced him to the chief Clerk, General Daniel Parker— I left them, and went to the fourth Auditor A. O. Dayton—with the Letter from Ebenezer T. Fogg, Administrator of Howard Freeman alias William Johnson and its enclosed documents—a copy of Fogg’s Letter of Administration; his order for the payment of the money to me—the affidavit of Howard Freemans father, and that of another Seaman on board the Ohio, of his service until his death— I left these papers with Mr Dayton, who sent me this Evening a warrant for the money payable by the Navy Agent at Boston, to my order as Attorney to the Administrator—signed by the fourth Auditor Dayton and the 2d. Comptroller Albion K. Parris. At the house, the presentation of petitions under the suspended rules was resumed— The Speaker having previously presented sundry executive communications— Botts enquired of Cushing, Chairman of the currency Committee whether a report from them was to be expected soon— Cushing answered that he was ready to report whenever the Committee should so instruct him— That they had met twice a week; and this week three times— Botts said he was glad to hear it; for he had been told that the Committee would not report at-all. At the adjournment yesterday, Wise had raised the question of reception, and then the motion to lay that question on the table, upon a petition presented yesterday by Granger from Hopewell, Ontario County, New-York, praying for protection in their constitutional right to the use of the Post-Office, and adequate Security for their persons in all the States of the Union— Wise said that his motive for making the motion was that he considered the prayer of the petition to be for the circulation of incendiary pamphlets and the protection of incendiary persons.— The motion to lay on the table was carried by yeas and nays 101 to 74—and the same fate befell many other anti-slavery petitions, including Resolutions of the Legislature of the State of Vermont, presented by Slade The call for petitions was continued from New-York to Massachusetts. Campbell of South-Carolina objected to the reception of a remonstrance, because it was not a petition— And he objected to the reception and moved to lay the objection on the table of a petition for the recognition of the republic of Hayti— At this stage a motion was made and carried to adjourn.— The weather has been for several days almost at Summer heat.— Mrs Smith is confined to her chamber with the influenza; and my catarrhal cough is cruel.

Lawrence Foster, Gates, Giddings, Henry Linn, Maynard, Saltonstall.— Others had been notified and promised to attend but did not. Chittenden mistook the room— Went to that of the Committee of Post-Offices and Post-roads, and finding no body there, came to me afterwards, to enquire why the meeting had failed— I had drawn up a sketch, of six Resolutions to present to the meeting for consideration— The first three declaring the Rule to be unconstitutional—specially oppressive on the free States and especially outrageous to the rights of States— And the other three proposing remedial measures—the last proposing to form an association of members to restore to the People, the suppressed Constitutional right of petition, to hold weekly meetings— My draught of Resolutions was read— No exception was taken to either of them— But the meeting was so small that it was thought best to try for another more numerous meeting next Saturday.— At the house Everett from the Committee on the apportionment reported a Bill, and sundry documents— The ratio of representation is reported is 68000 to each member— A debate of two hours was started. W. Cost Johnson moved the recommitment of the Bill to a Committee of one Member from each state; but the motion prevailed to refer it to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and make it the special order of the day for theof February, and every succeeding day, till the passage of the Bill— My Petition from Georgia next came up— Thomas F. Marshall’s motion that I should be permitted to address the house in my own defence Campbell of South-Carolina voted for it and then moved a reconsideration, and commenced a debate about receiving and rejecting abolition petitions.— But the moment I opened my lips to answer him the Speaker stopped me for irrelevancy— The house refused to reconsider; and I addressed the house—but I was not allowed to speak five minutes without interruption, and speeches of double that length from W. Cost Johnson, Wise, Rayner, and others, till I had got half through reading an extract from Wise’s Accomac Letter; when they succeeded in arresting me, by a vote that I should not proceed and the house adjourned— I dined with Mr Martini the chargé d’Affaires from Holland—Mr Webster, Lord Morpeth, Mr Rives, Mr Legare, Messrs. Fox and Bodisco, Baron Roenne—Mr Lisboa, the Brazilian chargé d’Affaires, Mr Hudson, Secretary of Legation to Mr Fox, Robert Tyler and one more were of the party— A sumptuous banquet— Home, between 9 and 10.

Sunday  Another disturbed, restless and almost sleepless night, with symptoms of threatened cramp, followed by a not much more comfortable day.— I attended public worship nevertheless, alone at the capitol and heard Mr Maffitt, as he announced, upon the necessity of divine revelation— His text, as he had last Sunday given notice that it would be, was from Job—11.7. [“]Canst thou by searching find out GOD? canst thou find out the Almighty, unto perfection? 8. It is as high as Heaven, what canst thou do! deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 9. The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the Sun.—” The hall was crowded to suffocation— I got a Seat in one of the Reporters boxes, only by the kindness of Christopher Morgan, who had it and insisted upon my taking it— Mr Maffitts eloquence reminds me, more than of any thing else of the froth of spruce beer, exceedingly pleasant to the taste—but the mere froth of small beer mere gas, without substance and without permanent effect— His articulation is slow, distinct, theatrical,—his voice clear, strong melodious—his learning the off scouring of Magazines, Reviews, Newspapers, and the romances of Sir Walter Scott—his logic, below zero—his flights of Fancy, sky rocketish just high enough to be lost in the clouds, and his puffs upon the Bible, which he handles as signor Blitz handles his cup and balls, sickening to those who believe it all the acting of a part— His power is all imaginative and not pathetic— His delivery furnishes an excellent study for a young lawyer, legislator, or stump orator, and a theme for philosophical reflection and enquiry what is the elementary adamant of attraction which always gathers overflowing multitudes to hear a public Speaker— I walked home, and in the afternoon attended at St. John’s Church, where Mr Van Ingen of Philadelphia read the Evening service for Septuagesima Sunday, and preached from 1. Corinthians 2.4 [“]And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power 5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God—” The text seemed to have some application to the contrast between the discourse of the preacher, a written Sermon, calm, cool, plain, unadorned, argumentative, persuasive, and the rhapsody that I had heard at the Hall of the house of representatives this morning. The afternoon auditory was scanty as usual—but Lord Morpeth was there, and a subject of much notice— Dr Thomas was here to visit Mrs Smith, and Mrs Goods; both of whom are confined to their beds— My own indisposition has not yet attained that extent of malignity; but if sickness of the heart could confine me, I should be a prisoner in my house.

Mr Van Ingen, who preached yesterday at St. John’s Church had called on me, on Saturday, with a Letter commendatory from the Secretary of War John C. Spencer, and requested an interview, with me, which I appointed for 9. O’Clock this morning, when he accordingly came. His object was to solicit my assistance in behalf of a claim of his father for military bounty land in reward for services of his father in the War of Independence; the claim is before the Committee of private land-claims, and is in the charge of Archibald L. Linn of Schenectady New-York— I promised my good will in its favour— Mr G. L. Thompson sent his son for a newspaper which he had sent me containing a report of certain proceedings of the joint Commission upon claims against Mexico, now sitting in this city; and of the umpire Baron Roenne the Prussian Minister—but I had not had time to read it; and asked the boy to call again to-morrow— At the house the curious decision of the house on Saturday, sustaining the Speaker in pronouncing me out of order, upon a point made by Raynor, which the Speaker himself said was not the point decided by him came up— I claimed the right to proceed; but the house by yeas and nays decided that I should not— This arbitrary decision was no sooner announced than Wise started up and swaggeringly said—and now is my turn! and he demanded to be heard in defence of himself against charges, which he pretended I had made against him— The rabid democrats of the north were all for allowing him, but his motion was finally laid on the table—by yeas and nays 101. to 78. and most of those who voted for silencing me voted also against silencing him— I then renewed the motion to refer the petition to the Committee with instructions to choose a chairman if they think proper—debate arising thereon it was laid over; and I presented sundry other petitions— One from Benjamin Emerson and 45 others of Haverhill, Massachusetts, praying Congress, to take measures for peacably dissolving the Union with an assignment of three reasons— I moved its reference to a select Committee with instructions to report an answer assigning the reasons why the prayer of the petition ought not to be granted— Then came another explosion, and after snarling debate a Resolution offered by Thomas W. Gilmer, that I deserved the censure of the house, for presenting a petition praying for the dissolution of the Union— Hot debate arose upon this, in the midst of which the house adjourned— I went into the Senate chamber, where Mr Preston of South-Carolina was speaking against Resolutions presented by Clay of Kentucky, for amending the Constitution. He soon finished and the Senate adjourned— Walk home— Evening in meditation— "

Tuesday  Met the Committee of foreign Affairs— I attended at ten— Gilmer came in shortly after—then Everett, Cushing, Granger and Proffit— Gilmer objected to proceeding to business till 11. O’Clock; waiting for a full meeting; but Hunter, W. Cost Johnson and Rhett did not come— Gilmer and Proffit were very uneasy and more than once went out and consulted together— Gilmer proposed to adjourn supposing the Committee had nothing to do— But there were numerous references to the Committee since their last meeting of private claims, which were distributed among the members for reports— Mr Everett said he should prefer to wait till next week to present his report upon the claim of Margaret Meade— After the adjournment of the Committee, Mr Cushing said to me that it was the intention of the Southern members of the Committee to displace me and elect him Chairman of the Committee, and he proposed to excuse himself from taking any part in the movement— I said I did not see any reason, why he should withdraw from acting on the subject.— He said I had expressed the opinion that he was too much prejudiced against England. I said I did not see why that should require him to decline, the performance of his duty— At the house, Fillmore obtained by a vote of yeas and naysa postponement of the privileged question (Gilmer’s resolution of censure upon me) till one O’Clock, in which he introduced the general appropriation Bills and sundry Resolutions, and urged the house to take up the treasury note Bill, returned from the Senate with an amendment striking out Gilmer’s additional Section, but they refused—a motion was made to lay the bill on the table—lost by yeas and naysto.At one Gilmer’s resolution of censure upon me was taken up— Thomas F. Marshall offered a much more violent one with a flaming preamble charging me in substance with subornation of perjury and high treason; and resolutions that the house might well expel me, but would only pass upon me the sentence of their highest indignation, and turn me over for the rest to my own conscience and the contempt of the world— The Speaker received this Resolution, and when Marshall finished his speech in support of it called upon me for my answer to it, and said the question would be on the adoption of the Resolution.— I said I thought it impossible the house should entertain the Resolution and after a few remarks postponing my defence till it should be ascertained that I stand accused I finished, and was followed by Henry A. Wise in a speech of personal invective upon me, took nearly two hours, and then at the motion of his colleague Hopkins, the house adjourned— Winthrop and John P. Kennedy invited me to go home and dine with them at their lodgings in 4 1/2 street Mr Beuth’s, which I did— Samuel T. Armstrong, of Boston was there, and a Mr Rockwell of Norwich Connecticut was there. Mrs Kennedy and Mrs Winthrop, and Miss Bigelow were also at table— Mrs Winthrop, has a look of an opening grave upon her face— Miss Bigelow after dinner, performed one tune upon the piano, and soon after 7. I came home— Minott Thayer, the two Hart’s father and son, and Mr, Mrs and Miss David Hoffman enlivened the evening, and left me but a short remnant of hours to muse. "

                "text": "28. Friday IV.  Mr Weld was again here, and undertook to mark the passages in Marshall’s Age of Washington, recounting the charge against him of being under English influence— At the house, immediately after the reading of the journal Fillmore enquired of the Speaker what was the business before the house, and was answered that it was the question of privilege, on my trial— Lewis Williams moved a call of the house, which was carried and pursued until 201. members answered to their names, after which the call was superseded— The question was upon the motion of Richard W. Thompson of Indiana, to lay Marshall’s Resolutions of censure upon me, on the table— Marshall now with intense importunity, urged Thompson to withdraw his motion, to give Marshall the opportunity to explain and to justify himself, that Thompson after much struggling yielded upon condition that Marshall after delivering his few words, would renew the motion to lay the whole subject on the table.— Marshall then commenced a violent declamatory and most eloquent philippic of nearly two hours against me— He laboured with agonizing energy to answer the speeches of Underwood and of Botts delivered yesterday and was particularly resentful against Underwood— I interrupted him occasionally to rectify gross misrepresentations of facts, and sometimes to provoke him into absurdity; as for example at one part of his speech that the northern abolitionists knew nothing about the condition of the Slaves he assumed a courteous tone, and invited me to visit the western Country— “To be lynched”—said I—“very likely”—said he and proceeded— When he closed he renewed according to his pledge to Thompson, the motion to lay the whole subject on the table, but said he earnestly hoped it would not prevail; and voted against it—when the roll was called upon the question to lay on the table Botts rose, and asked if I wished to reply to Marshall; I said I would not be responsible for the consumption of one hour of time upon concerns merely personal to me— That Marshall had occupied two hours in a personal invective upon me found upon principles totally unfounded and unjust. Here I was stopped by calls to order and not allowed to answer the question— The motion to lay on the table was rejected by yeas and nays 96 to 110. and I arose to make my defence— Gilmer interrupted me to enquire whether he could not have an opportunity to make a speech in support of his resolutions of censure— The Speaker said he would unless the whole subject should be laid on the table or the previous question taken. Gilmer then apologized to me for interrupting me, and I entered upon my defence I was soon interrupted by Wise to defend himself for his share in the Cilley duel, and challenged him to name any colleague of mine who ever told him that I had defended at a public meeting his innocence in that affair. He said there were two—or three of them—they were now present—he would not name them, but leave them to answer for themselves—and a dead silence followed— I caused to be read at the Clerk’s table extracts from the report of the majority of the Committee, on the Cilley duel case, and from the minority report of Elmore in the same case— It was now past 4. O’Clock, and the request of Botts and many others I yielded the floor to him for a motion to adjourn which he made and it was carried— I came home to a sick family and to musings for the further defence of myself against this persecution.

H. Lewis’s plan— H. R— Everett of Vermont gave notice that he would call up the apportionment Bill next Tuesday and made a report on the case of Blair and Rives— Gamble of Georgia, asked leave to present Resolutions of the Legislature of that State, concerning the establishment of certain Post-roads— I said, as I had said last week to Cross of Arkansas, that I would readily consent to the House’s taking up for consideration, their Resolutions, provided they would at the same time take up and pass upon those I had offered, calling upon the President and two of the Executive Departments for information essential to my defence— The Speaker considered this, as an objection to the reception of Gamble’s motion, and called up my trial as the order of the day— I then demanded the action of the house upon my Resolutions of call— Gilmer writhed and wriggled, and moved to lay my first Resolution on the table— Jones of Maryland moved to lay the whole subject on the table which I resisted and was rejected by yeas and nays 89 to 112. Pickens, Holmes, Smith of Virginia and Gilmer opposed the call, but it was carried 107 to 96. as was the second 95 to 84. The third at the motion of Gentry was laid on the table to 64— I entered upon my defence. Sommers moved an Amendment to Marshall’s amendment of Gilmer’s Resolution of censure.— Sommers’s amendment was to refer the whole subject to a select committee He moved the previous question but withdrew it at the earnest importunity of Gilmer, who was teeming with a Speech against me— He spoke accordingly about an hour, and then upon a motion of Mallory, the house adjourned. I dined with Kennedy and Winthrop.— Lord Morpeth, Genl. Scott, Mr Southard, D. D. Barnard, and Mr Meredith of Baltimore were of the party—very pleasant— I had visits this day from Genl Harlan, an adventurer in the East, with Genl. Daniel Parker; and Mr Whittemore, who married a daughter of J. P. Dewint dined with my family. "

Mr Ratcliff called on me this morning, and read to me the answer he had received from the Secretary of State, to his application as the agent and in behalf of the Republic of the Isthmus— It is procrastinative, and argues soundly the necessity of delay before recognizing as an Independent State, a part of an extensive country with which we are in friendly relations. Mr Ratcliff seemed earnestly inclined to press for the interposition of our government to mediate for the final separation of the State of the Isthmus from New Grenada, but I dissuaded him from that; and advised him to wait patiently for the result of the informal mission to the Isthmus contemplated by Mr Tyler— At the house my Resolution calling for A. Stevenson’s correspondence with Commodore Hull, inadvertently overlooked yesterday, was taken up, and at my motion adopted without a division— Gilmer consumed nearly two hours in his long meditated and bitterly rancorous speech against me—when he closed, Cushing started up, but the Speaker said I was entitled to the floor in my own defence. I spoke accordingly about an hour and a half; and brought to light the conspiracy among the Southern Members of the Committee of foreign Affairs to displace me as Chairman, and to elect Cushing in my stead— I produced the anonymous Letter from Jackson N.C. 20 Jany 1842. threatening me with assassination; and the engraved portrait of me, with the mark of a rifle ball on the forehead, with the motto to stop the music of John Quincy Adams 6th. President of the United States  These were Gilmer’s own words excepting the word fiddler which his echo changed to babbler— I produced also, and read the minutes of the proceedings in the Committee of foreign Affairs— I reviewed my relations with the Virginian Presidents of the United States heretofore Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and contrasted them with this base conspiracy of three Virginians banded here, together with numerous accomplices in and out of the house for my destruction. Near four O’Clock, I closed for the day, with an apt quotation from Moore’s Love’s of the Angels, and came home very much exhausted. "

I occupied the whole of this day in continuing my defence before the house— I began by renewing the charge upon Gilmer of having tampered with my colleague Cushing by the offer to choose him chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs in my place— He denied it positively, and called upon Cushing as positively to deny it; which with no small blustering he did— I then called upon Cushing to say who it was that had made the overture to him, which after some shuffling he declined to do, upon the pretence of not revealing private conversation but R. B. Rhett was forced to come out and acknowledge that he was the man, who on the same day when Gilmer gave notice in the house that he should move in Committee to chuse another Chairman, went to Cushing, and told him that they would elect him chairman in my place. Cushing repelled the advance, and said he would not serve, and intreated Proffit to dissuade them from the attempt which he did for two days, without success— After bringing out all this, I returned to the Haverhill petition—and to the external conspiracy against me. To the Gilmer and Marshall Resolutions of Censure, and the intervening Southern Caucus, I brought out Triplett to acknowledge that he called the Caucus.— Marshall that his resolutions had been submitted to them, and that there were forty members and more at the Caucus— I paid my tribute of thanks to Lot Warren of Georgia for his manly Declaration yesterday, that he would give no countenance whatever to these proceedings against me, and I returned with warm acknowledgments the kindness of the members from Kentucky, Maryland and Virginia who have refused to join in this conspiracy against me, and I charged the Newspapers of this City and District, with injustice to me; the Globe being daily filled with abuse, and invective upon me, while I am here on my trial; and the reporters of the intelligencer, suppressing the most essential parts of my defence— I specially refuted the pretence that the Union could be dissolved only by force, and cited the example of the peaceable dissolution of the confederation Union, by the present Constitution of the United States— Adjourned after 3.— Mr Whittemore dined with us— Evening visits from Mrs and Miss Hoffman and Minott Thayer— J.

No report of my yesterday’s speech in the National Intelligencer; but a blustering Notification that as I have chosen to complain of their reporters, they will report no more, without my own authority.— This is a mere subterfuge, to suppress the publication of my defence, and the exposure which I made of the conspiracy in and out of the house against me— I read the paragraph in this morning’s Intelligencer merely stating that I had continued my defence, and the sturdy notification that would report nothing further, unless furnished by myself, and I commented freely upon them, as proof demonstrative of the servile submission of the Press in this District to the Slave tyranny of the South— And I requested a postponement of further proceedings on my trial till next Thursday week for time to receive answers to my calls on the executive Departments, and to prepare for my defence so that it may be reported without delay— Marshall made a bitter and spiteful speech against the postponements, and Arnold moved the previous question upon the Resolutions— I saw that would cut me off from all further defence, and preferred going on at once— Arnold at my request withdrew his motion for the previous question— I withdrew mine for postponement and proceeded. I was not well prepared; having expected that there would be no opposition to my motion for a postponement; but I found no lack of matter for discourse till the motion between 3. and 4. for adjournment which was carried— My last missile upon Marshall, was an exquisite blast upon Slavery, by himself in his pamphlet Letters to the Commonwealth Newspaper in Kentucky; which pamphlet he himself had given me some weeks since. He writhed under it in agony.— Before I had read the extract half through Romulus M. Saunders started up on a point of order on the old pretence that I had no right to discuss the subject of Slavery— The Speaker ruled the point against him— He appealed and demanded the yeas and nays which were refused, and the decision of the speaker sustained 97 to 25— I saw my cause was gained and Marshall was sprawling in his own compost— I came home scarcely able to crawl up to my chamber, but with the sound of Io triumphe! ringing in my ear— Doctor Frye dined with us, and Miss Cutts was here this Evening— Marshall sent to me and demanded the return of his pamphlet.

[“]That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith: that ye being rooted and grounded in love, 18. may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth and height; 19 and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.” After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read prayers for the Sunday before Lent, and preached from Matthew 13.47. “Again: The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net, that was cast into the Sea, and gathered of every kind.” My attention, morning and afternoon involuntarily wandered from the preachers and their discourses to the critical nature of my own position, confident of my deliverance from this particular assault upon me, so senseless, that its malignity merges by its stupidity, not into innocence but into harmlessness, but always distrustful of my own controul over my own Spirit— One hundred members of the house, represent Slaves, four fifths of whom would crucify me, if their votes could erect the cross.— forty members representatives of the free in the league of Slavery and mock democracy, would break me on the wheel if their votes or wishes could turn it round— And four fifths of the other hundred and twenty are either so cold or so lukewarm, that they are ready to desert me at the very first scintillation of indiscretion on my part.— The only formidable danger with which I am beset is that of my own temper— We had numerous visitors this evening among whom was General Jesup, who came to ask Letters of recommendation for his wife’s brother Mr Croghan, who is going to England in pursuit of an Englishman named Schenly, with whom his daughter an heiress of two millions of dollars has just eloped and whom she has married— She is but 14 years of age, and he enticed her from a boarding school.— Mr Barnard came, with a manuscript report by the reporters of the National Intelligencer of my speech of yesterday for my revisal— They sent it to Mr Barnard, supposing that after their sally against me, I might possibly not incline to receive it directly from themselves. Mr Barnard told me that intimations had been very distinctly given to Gales and Seaton that their treatment of me could not be tolerated at the North, and that this was the occasion of their sending their reporters notes to me through him— I was up till past midnight revising the notes of the Friday’s debate.

Mr Weld was here this morning with a cheering report of the impression of my defence of Thursday Friday and Saturday, upon the current of popular opinion out of the house— A Mr Dorsey, a Stranger, brought me a document which he supposed might be useful to me, in my defence—and Robert Reeves the Scotch ex-custodian of the Treasury building came and took back his manuscript dialogue between a Calvinist and an Arminian which he had lent me to read, and in which he is sure that he has definitively settled the knotty problem of predestination and free will— I prepared a minute of the outlines of the continuance and conclusion of my defence, which would have occupied at least a week.— But I saw on Saturday that the house was tired of the whole subject; and that to close it now would afford relief to all parties.— I went to the house therefore prepared to proceed; but willing to stop short and dismiss the subject from the consideration of the house forever— I was belated, and the house had been about ten minutes in session when I entered and took my Seat— Other business was under consideration, but the question of privilege, or my trial was soon called up. I then observed that having perceived on Saturday some impatience on the part of the House to get rid of this subject, and persevering in the determination not to be responsible for one hour of time unnecessarily consumed on this subject, if the house was ready to lay it on the table forever, I would acquiesce in that decision without requiring further time for my defence; of which I should need much, if required to proceed— Botts then moved to lay the whole subject on the table forever—carried by yeas and nays 106 to 93. Meriwether of Georgia, asked to be excused from voting because he hotly lusted for a vote of the severest censure upon me, but despaired of obtaining it— The house refused to excuse him, and he voted to lay on the table the whole subject. They then took in hand the Haverhill petition and refused to receive it 166. to 40— Briggs, Baker, Cushing, and Hudson voting with the majority— I then proceeded with my budget of which I presented nearly two hundred; till the house adjourned— Most of them were excluded by the rule, or laid on the table by objections to their reception— And thus ended the second prosecution of me, by the despotic process of contempt. D. D. Barnard offered sundry Resolutions denouncing this prosecution in its true character, but they were not in order, nor received by the house. "

Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Present Adams, Cushing, Everett, Granger— No Quorum— No Southern Member— Of course no business done, though Mr Everett was ready, with his report on the claim of Mrs Meade— Committee adjourned to Tuesday next. In the House the call for petitions had rested yesterday at the State of Maine— Fessenden had presented a Memorial from Portland complaining of the injurious operation of the Convention with Great-Britain upon the navigation, shipping and commercial interest of Maine. He had moved its reference to the Committee of foreign Affairs, and that it should be printed— An attempt was made to refuse the printing and the decision had been cut off by the adjournment— The printing and the reference were now ordered, and Fessenden now gave notice that he would at an early day move to rescind the rule that excludes the reception of anti-Slavery petitions.— And this day closed the call for petitions which had commenced on the 7th. of January— Cushing moved a reconsideration of the vote yesterday refusing to receive the Haverhill petition, and claimed to be heard on his motion—but the Speaker refused to hear him— Cushing then claimed that the question upon receiving a petition was debatable; but the Speaker decided it was not— Cushing appealed from the decision, and called for the yeas and nays; but they were refused, and the decision of the Speaker was sustained— Cushing quite wrathy. A Resolution offered by the Committee of Manufactures, authorising them to take testimony on the operation of the tariff laws was debated till the expiration of the morning hour— Then Committee of the whole on the State of the Union George N. Briggs in the Chair— Bills of appropriation for the relief and protection of American Seamen abroad, and for payment of Pensions were reported to the house, and ordered for engrossment— The civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill was read through and taken up by Sections— I suggested to Fillmore, to amend the composition of the Bill, by striking out the numberless repetitions of words applied to different offices—adjourned at half past 3— Minott Thayer spent the Evening with us.— And Mr Belcher read to me his Dissertation on the Longitude.

Called twice at the National Intelligencer Office; going to and returning from the Capitol— About the last third part of my Friday’s speech was reported by a young man named Niles whose first manuscript I could not decypher, and I was obliged to write over again most of the second— I attended the meeting of the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest— Present Adams, Underwood, Habersham, Smith— Absent C. J. Ingersoll, Randall, Houston, Bowne, and Hunter— No Quorum, and nothing could be done— My time night and day has been and yet is so absorbed for my own defence that I can attend to nothing else— Mr Smith said that he should not be here at the next weekly meeting, being obliged to go home to Connecticut on business. In the house, immediately after the reading of the Journal, Gilmer sent to the Speaker two papers; one signed by himself, R. M. T. Hunter, R. Barnwell Rhett and George H. Proffit asking to be excused from further service on the Committee of Foreign Affairs; because from recent occurrences it was doubtful whether the house would remove the chairman, and they were unwilling to serve with one in whom they had no confidence— The other paper was a Letter from W. Cost Johnson to Gilmer apologising for not attending the meeting of the Committee yesterday; but assuring him that if he had attended he would have voted for another Chairman— These papers were received without objection; the four fugitive members were excused from further service by a shout of acclamation— Cost Johnson then asked to be excused, and was excused in like manner— After some interloping business, the Speaker proposed to call the Committees for Reports, which was acquiesced in by the house— When he called the Committee of Foreign Affairs, I rose and moved that the vacancies in the Committee occasioned by the resignations should be filled; the Speaker said he should fill them on the suggestion— The Resolutions to authorise the Committee of Manufactures to take testimony was further debated and laid aside—the pension appropriation bill, and that for the relief of American Seamen abroad were passed— Just at the moment of adjournment a volunteer Speaker commenced a harangue from the circular gallery denouncing the wrath to come; but was soon escorted by the door-keeper, out of the house— Minott Thayer spent the evening here.— I had sent a note on Monday to Lord Morpeth inviting him to dinner this day or tomorrow; and received this morning his answer; engaged every day, until his departure— He was a constant attendant upon my trial.

Thursday  Call at the Office of the National Intelligencer with the revisal of the Reporter’s Notes, of the close of last Friday—and with my Oration at Newburyport and the Jubilee of the Constitution, from which I read extracts— But the Letter from William Jay, and Marshall’s pamphlet from which I read the extract on Saturday I cannot now obtain— Mr Leavitt sent them to Boston with his own report of my Saturdays speech for the Boston Courier. I attended the meeting of the Committee on the Longitude; of which Joseph R. Ingersoll was the first Chairman; but was afterwards excused from service on the Committee, at his own request.— Boardman of New Haven then became the chairman; and I was appointed in the place of Ingersoll— The Committee consist of five Boardman, Keim, Sumter, and Aycrigg, and myself instead of Ingersoll— Boardman and Keim were the only members at the Committee room this morning, and Boardman was very urgent upon me to assume the Office of Chairman which I positively declined— We had some desultory conversation upon the memorial from the philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and agreed to meet again to-morrow morning.— In the house on the reading of the journal, the appointment by the Speaker was announced of Edward D. White of Louisiana, Augustin H. Shepperd of North-Carolina, Isaac E. Holmes of South-Carolina, Reuben Chapman of Alabama, and Mark A. Cooper of Georgia, five Southern Slaveholders as members of the Committee of foreign Affairs, in the place of the five who yesterday resigned— The Resolution authorizing the Committee of Manufactures to take testimony was laid on the table after a call of the house by yeas and nays 108 to 79.— After a long debate the Committee on public expenditures were authorised to employ a Clerk— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Briggs in the Chair upon the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— Another long and multifarious debate first on an amendment offered by C. Cushing to add 3000 dollars to the item of appropriations for the pay of Clerks in the Office of the Clerk of the house two of whom this Committee proposed to curtail because they were not authorised by law; and the discussion soon widened into a general retrenchment debate, demagogical and hypocritical, in the midst of which the house adjoined— Minott Thayer was again here great part of the evening.

The bells rung a full half hour; but I slept so sound that I heard nothing of it, and the first that I learnt of the fire was by a notice of it in the National Intelligencer.— That paper contains also the report of the remainder of my speech on Friday last— I called at the Bank of Washington, where the Cashier refused to receive Virginia bank bills, the only currency now circulating in the City— I had received yesterday 60 dollars of Philadelphia Bank Bills from J. Connell who had received them at the Bank of North America for 3 coupons of interest on my Cincinnati City bonds, payable 1st. of Novr. last— I exchanged them yesterday at par for Virginia bank bills, hitherto current here, which the Pennsylvania bills are not—but as they would not now take the Virginia bills in deposite at the Bank of Washington, I returned to Fowler’s Exchange-Office, and took back the Philadelphia bill, for 50 dollars, for which he had yesterday given me a Virginia bill, which I now returned— I then called at the National Intelligencer Office, and left with Mr Gales, Stansbury’s revised notes of my whole Saturday’s speech— Only part of it can however be published to-morrow— Judge William Jay’s Letter, and the extract from Marshall’s pamphlet, Mr Leavitt sent on with his report of last Saturday to the Boston Courier, and I cannot procure them here— I returned Marshall’s pamphlet on his peremptory demand, and Stansbury says he has been unable to obtain it from him to copy the extract that I read.— I was late for the meeting of the Committee on the Longitude. I found Boardman still in the Committee room— Aycrigg and Keim had been there, and Mr Belcher with them. He was still there, but the Committee had adjourned.— In the house the morning hour was chiefly consumed in an application from the Committee of manufactures to be allowed to employ a clerk—defeated by two successive motions to lay it on the table; the first failing by a tie vote of 88 to 88. with the casting vote of the Speaker against it—carried five minutes after by a vote of 97 to 89— Then Committee of the whole, Zadok Casey in the Chair, and private business occupied the remainder of the day till the adjournment— I had a long morning visit from Mr Heman Lincoln, and a tedious evening one from Mr Von Horn. Also a Mr Mansfield brought a new engraved portraiture of the ten Presidents grouped together— I revised the proof slips for to-morrow’s Intelligencer, and was up till half an hour past Midnight. "

Mr Burnell, introduce to me two of his constituents by the name of Lindsey and of Eyre.— At the house sundry petitions and memorials were presented by several members altogether out of their turn, until Proffit arrested this surreptitious mode of bringing business before the house by objecting to its further continuance— It is practiced only by the pushing members, and gives them undue advantages over others— Long discussion upon the question whether the Committee on private land-claims should be allowed to employ a clerk, when the pressure of their business should require one.— The motion was laid on the table, then reconsidered and laid on the table again, by yeas and nays 84 to 81.— Everett asked leave to offer a Resolution, that the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union should be discharged from the further consideration of the census apportionment bill; and that it should be taken up next Tuesday, and discussed from day to day, till Tuesday the 22d. when, the amendments should be voted on and the bill disposed of—but Mallory objected, and the Resolution could not be received— Everett said however that he would call it up on Monday.— A Message was received from the President, in answer to a Resolution of impertinent enquiries, by what authority a Committee of investigation into the affairs of the Custom House at New-York— He says it was by his obligation to see that the Laws be faithfully executed and to give information to Congress from time to time of the State of the Union— He promises in due time a copy of the commission, and the proceedings.— Committee of the whole, Zadok Casey in the Chair on sundry private Bills reported from the Committee of Claims some of which were reported to the house and passed; and others laid aside for further consideration until upon some question taken there was found no Quorum voting— After two attempts, the Committee rose and reported the fact to the house— Then an abortive effort for a call, and an adjournment after 3— Mr William Hill of Cambridge, son of the late Aaron Hill several year’s Postmaster at Boston, brought me a Letter of recommendation from President Quincy of Harvard University.

[“]Wherefore, seeing we also, are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.” The preacher said that this was a figure taken from the antient Grecian Olympic games and his discourse was a continued parallel between the incidental usages of the Olympic games and the race of the Christian. His knowledge of the Olympic games however did not appear to be very profound— Of the various games the foot race is that which the Apostle takes for his similitude to the Christian race, and the chapter is a fervid exhortation to the disciples to energy, perseverance and strenuous exertion of faith in Christ, though at the cost of every thing precious in life, and of life itself. It is the sequel to the preceding chapter in which he had defined Faith, and enumerated all the wonders atchieved by it from Abraham down through the most renowned of his descendants, dwelling with agonizing emphasis upon the persecutions they had endured, and the cheerfulness with which they has sacrificed their lives in support of the Faith— The attendance in the house was very thin, owing to the weather; and it evidently dashed somewhat the vivacity of the reverend Orator. His manner is conversational, discursive and eccentric—frequently speaking of himself and his opinions— He made some allusion to a passage in the Pilgrims progress, and said he, I like Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s progress.— He said something of the Roman Catholic doctrine of no salvation out of the Church— I dont believe a word of it! said he— He quoted a saying of my father whom he called the elder Adams, and another of the late William Wirt whose daughter Catherine, with her husband Alexander Randall was present She spoke to me about the life and papers of her father, and I invited her to my house.— There was no church at St. John’s this afternoon— I attended at the second Presbyterian, and heard Mr Clarke from Revelations 3.21. “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my father in his throne.”— I was yet too much absorbed with this world to pay due attention to the Sermon— This evening I received the Boston Courier of last Thursday the 10th. containing Mr Leavitt’s report of my speech of Saturday the 5th. in which the extracts from Marshall’s pamphlet, and the Letter of Judge William Jay, on Renwick’s falsification of his father’s Life and opinions are inserted— Miss Cutts was here this Evening.

Monday  Elijah Thayer is the man, who one day last week commenced a harangue from the circular gallery of the house of Representatives, just at the moment of the adjournment of the house— He came this morning and told me his name and began a discourse of religious insanity to which I listened patiently for several minutes watching to ascertain if it would come to any controvertible point; but it was like the pouring of water over a mill-dam; a cento of texts from the scriptures with awful warnings of coming judgments— At last I interrupted him by enquiring what was his age—nineteen years—whence he came? from Mendon Massachusetts—what was his occupation? he had been living till within a few days in his father’s house—he broke out into a rhapsody against Slavery and Slave-holding— I advised him to hold his tongue, and to return to his fathers house assuring him that if he should talk to others as he did to me, he would soon find himself immured within the walls of a prison— He said that was precisely what he expected and what he wanted. He had no doubt he should be imprisoned; and should glory to suffer in the cause of righteousness.— I could not stay to hear him further, and left him to retire— Mr Leavitt called also, and Mr Cruit with an account and check on the Washington Bank of W. S. Smith— At the House immediately after the reading of the Journal, the Speaker presented Letters, from Mark A. Cooper, Isaac E. Holmes, and Reuben Chapman asking to be excused from serving on the Committee of Foreign Affairs. I imperfectly heard them read and took no notice of them— They were excused by a silent vote, and I moved that their places should be supplied, which the Speaker said should be done. The remainder of the day was occupied by the call of the States for petitions; beginning with the territory of Ioway and proceeding South and East, to Maine—they were all called through— I presented all that I had left except the three for the dissolution of the Union, which I gave notice that I intended to present hereafter— After I came home I advised Mr W. S. Smith to go to Philadelphia— Mr and Mrs John Angier arrived here this Evening to spend some time with us.— I went with my granddaughter Mary Louisa to the Theatre to see Yankee Hill, in three farces.

Cooper, Isaac E. Holmes, and Reuben Chapman, asking to be excused from serving on the Committee of foreign Affairs, and the two former were so insulting personally to me, that they are unquestionably breaches of privilege, and I confidently believe that the Speaker would have refused to receive or present them had they referred to any other man in the house: certainly not without giving notice to the inculpated member and to the house of the accusatory character of the Letters— I was very strongly inclined to make it a point of privilege in the house to vindicate my own character— I had given notice to Holmes and Chapman on Saturday of the Meeting of the Committee this morning—neither of them had hinted his intention to ask to be excused— At the meeting this morning, the six members in function were all present—but as there were three vacancies, it was agreed to postpone till the next meeting the regular business of the Committee, I read the Letters of Mark A. Cooper and Holmes and said I considered them gross breaches of privilege, and had serious thought of denouncing them to the house— But Everett and Granger said it would be giving them an importance, which the writers earnestly desired, while without such notice they would be as they were, universally despised— Shepperd and Edward T. White, thought the Letters insidiously aimed more against them than against me; by the principle assumed that no Southern man could in honour consent to serve with me.— I determined therefore to sacrifice again my personal feelings for the sake of Peace, and to take no notice of the Letters.— In the house, by perseverance in two several attempts, Underwood, Chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, obtained the passage of a bill extending the time during which the District Banks shall be authorised to receive in deposit, and pay out Virginia and Maryland Bank-Bills, a year longer— Summers’s select Committee Retrenchment report was debated on a Resolution to curtail two of the twelve under Clerks in the Clerks office of the house. The morning hour expired leaving this debate undecided— Everett gave notice that he would to morrow move a suspension of the rules to take up the apportionment Bill. Gentry moved that the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, should be instructed to strike out of the general appropriation Bill, every item not authorised by an existing law, which after much debate was carried 144 to 22— That’s my thunder, but it will be of no avail. Evening with Mary Louisa at the Theatre— Hill’s benefit— Angiers at the Drawing-room. "

Ward said if the house should reconsider a Message might be sent to the Senate to demand the return of the Bill, to which the Speaker assented; but D. D. Barnard appealed from his decision, and claimed to debate it— Lewis Williams had moved to lay Ward’s motion for reconsideration upon the table, and Ward insisted that he had moved the previous question upon his own motion for reconsideration— The Speaker said he had not heard Ward’s motion for the previous question, but would entertain it upon his averment that he had made it— Barnard maintained that a motion not heard by the Speaker could not be before the house—but the Speaker adhered to his determination to consider Ward’s motion as before the house, because though not heard by him, Ward averred that he had made it— This previous question stifled all debate upon Barnard’s appeal from the decision of the Speaker to entertain Ward’s motion for reconsideration, because if it should prevail, a message might be sent to the Senate to return the Bill— Barnard withdrew his appeal, and Lewis Williams’s motion to lay Ward’s motion for reconsideration on the table by carried by yeas and nays 99 to 83. Everett made another abortive attempt to prevail upon the house to fix a time for the consideration of the apportionment bill— Then came a retrenchment debate on Summers’s curtailment of two Clerks, for the morning hour and the general appropriation bill, in the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union George N. Briggs in the Chair— M’Keon moved to strike out the enacting clause— The chairman decided that this was not in order— M’Keon appealed, but the chairman’s decision was sustained— The Committee rose and the house adjourned— The three vacancies in the Committee of foreign Affairs are not yet filled— I had for evening visitors Mr Winslow once of Boston but settled many years at Havre and Mr Stevens of New-York, a contractor to build a War Steamer.

I introduced him into the Library of Congress, and to the Librarian Meehan— And I went with him to the room where the Supreme Court of the United States were in Session— This room I re-entered with a silent thrill of delight; for the first time, since I was there at this time last year, under such an heavy pressure of responsibility, and with so glorious a result! I dare not trust myself with the exultation of my own heart on this occasion, so fearful I am of incurring the guilt of presumptuous vanity, for the feeling of deep humility. In the house after an effort of Cooper to run through a Resolution from the Committee on Indian affairs concerning the authority of the Secretary of War to employ certain clerks; and further debate on the first of Summers’s retrenchment Resolutions, in which Bowne of New-York and Milton Brown of Tennessee consumed the time till the expiration of the morning hour— When Fillmore called for the orders of the day, Caleb Cushing, Chairman of the Committee on the currency, and the Board of Exchequer, rose and said he had been directed by that committee to ask to be discharged from the further consideration of a certain petition referred to them; and to report in part upon so much of the President’s Message as relates to a board of Exchequer; with a Bill—a Question not a little debated arose whether the report and bill should be read, and who should read them? Stanly asked what was meant by a report in part, and whether the Committee proposed to report further?— Cushing answered that the Committee meant it as a report in part, and insisted upon his right to read it—in which he was finally gratified.— The report was in a pompous, vainglorious obsequious style; but of the character of the Bill I could not judge upon a single reading. I heard enough of it however to satisfy me that I can never vote for it— Garrett Davis then presented a Counter-report for himself, part of which was read at his demand, and the reading of the rest of which was dispensed with, by his consent. John P. Kennedy another member of the Committee, gave notice that he would present a minority report— The Bill and reports were then referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and 2500 copies extra of the Bill and three reports were ordered to be printed— J. P. Kennedy moved to include in this order the exchequer board report of the Secretary of the Treasury; but that was rejected. These proceedings consumed the day, and soon after 3. the house adjourned Scarcely a day passes that I am not called from my feet by northern or western members to introduce to me strangers their friends or constituents of whose names or persons, I can retain no memory, but I was this day amused as well as surprized when Lewis Steenrod came to my seat and introduce one of his constituents from Wheeling— "

At the house, at last after four days for meditation by the Speaker the Journal of this morning announced James A. Meriwether of Georgia, Robert L. Caruthers of Lebanon Tennessee, and Alexander H. H. Stuart of Staunton Virginia, as members of the Committee of foreign affairs, in the place of Mark A. Cooper, Holmes and Chapman, excused from serving— Summers’s Retrenchment Resolutions were called up; but Milton Brown, whose speech was left unfinished yesterday, being unwell this morning, assented to a proposition from Fillmore to take up the general Appropriation Bill— John C. Clark had by leave reported from the Committee on Naval Affairs, a bill to establish additional ranks in the Navy of the United States, and for other purposes.— It proposes the ranks of Admirals, Vice Admirals, and rear Admirals, with corresponding compensations— The Bill was twice read, and Lot Warren moved to lay it on the table— But the yeas and nays were called; the report giving the reasons for the Bill was read. Warren withdrew his motion to lay it on the table, and it was referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— This New born passion of the South for the increase of the Navy, this profusion of appropriations recommended and urged by the Secretary, of that Department is one of the most curious phenomena in our National History.— From Jefferson’s dry docks and gunboats, to Admirals, three Deckers, and War-Steamers equal to half the Navy of Great-Britain, there is more than a stride— There is a flying fishes leap. A number of private bills, were taken up and passed, after which the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the Appropriation Bill, Briggs in the chair— The retrenchment fever ran high— Fillmore, according to order had struck out all items of appropriation not authorized by law.— M’Keon without rhime or reason moved to strike out 50000 dollars for contingent expenses of the two houses, and Graham of North-Carolina moved to insert an interdict to the furnishing stationary ever hereafter to the members— There was no Quorum to vote— The Committee rose and reported the fact— A call of the house produced 163 answers to their names Briggs took the Chair again Charles Brown pronounced an invective and Wise a Panegyric upon the house both demagogues— The Committee rose and the house adjourned— Evening visits from Mrs Madison and her niece Miss Payne—and from Gonon.

She has no subscription list and keeps no accounts, but upon these occasional voluntary contributions has kept up a weekly newspaper for eight or ten years, under various titles; the last of which was Paul Pry—exchanged a year or two ago for the Huntress— In the house, the Speaker presented a Letter from the Secretary of State, notifying the house that the printing of Statistics compiled from the returns of the census was completed—and asking Congress for more specific directions respecting the distribution of the copies— There was a communication also from the Secretary of the Navy reporting the cost of two War-Steamers that have been built—the Mississippi 528000 dollars and the Missouri 553000— Mr Summers’s retrenchment Resolution came up; and Milton Brown of Tennessee concluded his speech exposing many flagrant abuses in the misapplication of the contingent expenses of all the departments to introduce multitudes of supernumerary clerks, and other expenditures without authority of Law. He was followed by Mr Mathiot by one of the members from Ohio; hitherto a mute in the house; now a declaimer for retrenchment. Mr Saltonstall took the floor, but the morning hour was expiring, and Mr Giddings called for the orders of the day— A joint Resolution from the Senate reported by the Law Library Committee, provided for the removal of the Law Library, from the chamber where it now is, adjoining the general library, into a room under the charge of the Supreme Court was adopted— Sundry private bills at the third reading were taken up and acted upon—one laid on the table—one rejected, and one recommitted to the Committee of claims upon the discovery that the claim had already been provided for, by an act of the last Session of Congress—adjourned about 3. Evening visits from Mr and Mrs Alexander Randall— Mrs Randall is a daughter of the late William Wirt, and last Spring wrote me a Letter requesting me in the name of the family to write for publication a biography of her father, which request has been several times repeated, and was earnestly urged upon me by her this Evening. I have the best possible disposition to undertake the task; but find it impossible for want of time— Mrs Randall asked me to look over his papers which I promised to do. "

In the 26th. Congress, the election was furiously contested between them, and both of them were returned— Naylor first and the seat was finally adjudged to him— There was so much, not only of irregularity, but of foul corruption in that election, on both sides, that it would be difficult to say which was the worst— At the election for the present Congress, Naylor declined—and Ingersoll was chosen, by a majority of 1500 votes— He is one of the ablest, and most unprincipled men in the house. Mr Naylor told me he had been two or three days in the city, and was now about to return home, but would not go, without calling to see me. He left me to conjecture what the object of his visit to the city at this time was.— I conjectured from a somewhat dejected appearance that it was an unsuccessful canvass for the office vacated by the death of judge Hopkinson— At the second Presbyterian Church I heard Mr Clark, from John 18.36. [“]Jesus answered, My Kingdom is not of this world:” a prolific theme; and very remarkable, as at once, asserting by inference that he was the Messiah, and avoiding what must have been considered as treason against the government of Caesar. He claimed to be the monarch of the soul. His condition as under accusation of a capital crime was singular— Judea was a Roman Province—but the charge against him was for violating not the roman; but the Jewish Law— The condition, power and limitations of the Levitical law under the judges—the kings—the divided kingdoms, and the several Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, Grecian and Roman captivities, would form a very interesting and curious subject of enquiry, which I shall never have time to prosecute. At 4. this afternoon, at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read the Evening service for the second Sunday in Lent, and preached from Ezekiel 33.11. [“]Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live.”— Mr Hawley has a great propensity for selecting his texts from the prophets; but his faculty of commenting upon them is not so conspicuous— There is more unity in the whole collection of his discourses than in the composition of any one of them— Long evening visit from Mr Charles Daveis of Portland, a man of lively and copious conversation especially upon New-England historicals. I answered this evening I believe some days too late, an invitation to dine with the Clay whig club of the 8th. ward of the city of New-York, on the anniversary of the ratification of the Treaty of Ghent— My wife was this day much indisposed and confined to the chamber— "

During the excessive pressure upon my time during the days when I was upon trial, this diary ran twelve days in arrear— I took index minutes from day to day, and am now struggling with Herculean labour of recovering the back record. At the house this was the first day of the Session upon which the rule for the reception of resolutions was carried into execution— Allen of Maine offered one, calling on the President to communicate to the house the present state of the negotiation of the North-eastern boundary, and all the correspondence relating thereto not heretofore communicated.— Tillinghast of Rhode-Island, and Washington of North-Carolina offered Resolutions instructing the Committee on the judiciary, to consider the expediency of passing acts supplementary and amendatory to the bankrupt Law. Stanly offered a Resolution to alter the 132d rule so that a majority of the house may at any time fix in advance on a day for discharging the Committee of the whole from the further consideration of any bill. This is one of three amended rules adopted at the last Session of Congress, the proposal of which for permanency has within a few days been agreed upon in a recent whig caucus. The tendency of them all is to abridge debate, and I opposed them all at the late Session— I voted for this one now believing it indispensable to save the waste of time, and the profligate factious opposition of the Slave democracy in the house to defeat all salutary Legislation— The adoption of the Resolution was by those same means defeated this day— Wise, Turney, Clifton, Proffit—John G. Floyd, and Medill baffled a constant majority of 2 or 3, by successive motions, to lay on the table—for a call of the house, and to adjourn, and by taking the yeas and nays upon every question, four or five of which were alternately taken, till the flagging spirits of the whigs were wearied and worried out and they adjourned, near four. I gave notice to all the members of the reorganized Committee of foreign Affairs of the meeting to-morrow morning, and they all promised to attend. Mr John P. Kennedy presented his minority report from the Committee on the Currency; which was ordered to be printed in extra-numbers together with the majority Report and with that of Garrett Davis — Evening visits from Mr Leavitt and Mrs Hoffman.

H. Stuart, the whole reorganized Committee.— There was a Bill from the Senate authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to pay out a percentage to the Attornies and Agents of Claimants under three several Commissions, instituted by Treaties with Spain, France, and the two Sicilies, the sums awarded to whom have in whole or in part been retained in the Treasury for debts due by the Claimants to the United States— There were no papers with which to ascertain the reasons for this bill, which looked to me like a dip into the public treasury, to pay to the agents and attornies of claimants, all the money reserved to pay the debts of the claimants to the Treasury— Cushing said the Agents and Attornies had a lien upon the awards, which I said was at common Law, called champerty.— The further consideration of the Bill was postponed. Mr Everett read his report upon the claim of Mrs Margaret Meade, in its favour, which was also discussed and postponed. In the house Kennedy’s minority currency report was presented, and Saltonstall immediately moved to adjourn, on account of its being Washingtons birth day. It was carried by an unanimous shout.— Same in the Senate— I called at the Treasury Department, to enquire about the documents relating to the Smithsonian fund, promised me some weeks since— They were not yet ready; but the chief clerk promised again that they should be sent to me in two or three days— The Secretary Mr Forward said he had wished to have some conversation with me, and was intending to call at my house, and he asked me to give him my free and candid opinion, upon the state of our public affairs; and particularly of the Treasury and the revenue.— I gave him very freely my opinions, and told him there were two things which discouraged me more than all the rest—one that the democratic members of the house, from Pennsylvania all sacrificed the interest of their State, to their political alliance with the South; and the other that President Tyler’s bosom friends in the house defeated every attempt to raise a revenue sufficient to meet the expenditures of the year. He shook his head and made no answer. I asked him if besides the twelve millions loan, and the five millions Treasury Notes already issued there would not be a further deficit to be provided for, before the close of the present year—he said he feared there would— I told him that there was but one remedy—taxation— Excise as well as impost; and the only alternative, bankruptcy.— There was a birth-night assembly ball this evening; attended by Mr and Mrs Angier— Mrs Adams was quite indisposed— Dr Thomas here.

Mr Habersham told me he had received a Letter from the Gentleman who wrote the pretended petition signed by 28 fictitious names, from Habersham County, praying for my removal from the Office of Chairman of the Committee of foreign Affairs, who tells him, that he meant it only in sport— But as it had brought the members of the Georgia delegation, he felt it to be his duty to avow that he was the author of the paper; and that it was all a fiction— In the code of Slavery morality forgery is one of the ways and means for the defence of the peculiar-institutions— As I was going up the stairs to enter the house, I met one of the pages of the house, who told me that Mr Lewis Williams of North-Carolina, was lying at the point of death at his lodgings, Mrs Peyton’s— He died about 1. O’Clock P.M. while the house was in Session; but his death was not announced— Mr D. D. Barnard presented his amendment to the Exchequer board Bill reported by the Committee on the currency—that is to say a totally different bill—a substitute— James Cooper moved a joint resolution, rescinding that which only two days ago, directed the Law Library of Congress to be removed, into a lower and Supreme Court room, and after some debate Cooper’s resolution was carried— Everett moved an instruction to the Committee on the judiciary to consider the expediency of publishing a Stereotype-edition of the U.S. Laws.— Barker Burnell moved a very long call on the Secretary of the Navy for documents relating to the caste of the ships in the Navy— Then the Resolution from the Retrenchment Committee upon which Mr Saltonstall made a very sensible half an hour adverse speech— Briggs succeeded him not quite so long, on the other side and for the retrenchment of the two Clerks— He was followed by Pickens in a frothy bombastical style terminating in nothing.— Charles Brown took him in the same line, and they rattled along like tak empty tin tea-kettles over heaps of stones.— The general appropriation bill soon came up with another retrenchment debate, in which M’Keon and Proffit took part. On coming home I learnt that Mr T. B. Johnson had been struck yesterday with a paralytic affection, and was desirous of seeing me, to make his Will— I went this Evening to his house, with my wife, and sitting by his bedside took his dirirections for his will— I afterwards called at Mrs. Tudor, and saw Mrs Stuart and Mrs Parnell.

                "text": "24. VI. Thursday.  I was up till past one this morning, making a draught of a Will for Mr T. B. Johnson according to the directions which he gave me last evening—so far as I could understand them; for his tongue is much swollen, and his articulation very indistinct, though his mind is perfectly clear— This morning I wrote out a few words to say on the announcement in the house, of the decease of Lewis Williams.— I sent for Dr Thomas early this morning—read to him the draught of Mr Johnson’s Will that I had made—gave it to him to take to Mr Johnson, and read deliberately to him; minuting down on paper, any alteration or addition to it, which he would direct to be made— Mrs Askins, a claimant for a pension for husband’s services in the revolutionary War, was here; complaining much that her papers had been lost in the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives.— When the house met; immediately after the reading of the Journal, Kenneth Rayner, of North-Carolina, announced the death of Lewis Williams, the Father of the house, upon whom he pronounced a handsome eulogy, concluding with a motion for the usual obituary Resolutions of condolence with the family, and to attend the funeral to-morrow. I seconded the motion, and in a speech of about 5 minutes expressed the sorrow that I felt at this sudden and melancholy bereavement— Lewis Williams was one of the best men in the house or in the world. I was followed by William Cost Johnson who paid a feeling tribute to the memory of his friend. The Resolutions were then unanimously adopted and the house adjourned— Rayner immediately after came to my seat—offered me his hand—thanked me cordially for the remarks I had made, and made a frank and unqualified apology for the harsh language he used towards me, on my late trial— I told him it was all forgotten— Washington, Shepperd, Stanly and even Romulus M. Saunders— Thomas J. Campbell of Tennessee came and asked for a copy of my remarks, for a twin brother of Lewis Williams, now a judge in Campbell’s district—which I promised him. The Speaker appointed me one of the Committee of Arrangements for the funeral; and the Committee met immediately after the adjournment of the house, in the Speaker’s chamber. Some arrangements were made, and the Committee agreed to meet there again to-morrow morning at 11. At home Dr Thomas, brought me back the draught of Mr Johnson’s will, with minutes of the alterations and additions directed by him— My wife and Mrs Smith passed the day at his house— I was up till midnight making the second draught of his Will.

Johnson’s with the second draught of his Will, which I read to him and he fully approved, expressing an anxious wish that it might be signed and authenticated this day— Thence I went to the Capitol and met the Committee of Arrangements for the funeral of Lewis Williams in the chamber of the Speaker of the house The Committee were Kenneth Rayner John Q Adams William Cost Johnson, Romulus M. Saunders, John Pope, George W. Hopkins, and Horace Everett— After being duly caparisoned there, the Committee of Arrangement, and Pall bearers went to Mrs Peyton’s where the deceased had lodged, and where we found his two relatives Christopher H. Williams and Joseph L. Williams, both members of the house from Tennessee— After we had waited there nearly an hour, the corpse was brought down from the chamber; taken into the street, and thence borne in procession, preceded by us, to the Hall of the house of Representatives, where the religious service was performed by Mr Tustin, the Chaplain of the Senate, a presbyterian, the denomination of Christians to which Mr Williams belonged— The President with his Cabinet—the judges of the Supreme Court and most of the members of the Senate were present.— Mr Tustin’s discourse was appropriate, and not ineloquent— The procession then went, and deposited the body in the common vault of the Congressional burying ground— I rode in tete a tete, and in perfect harmony with Mr Rayner— No part of a funeral service was performed at the vault— We returned to the Capitol—eight or ten members of the house repaired to the Hall, where the Speaker took the Chair— The journal of yesterday was read, and the Speaker adjourned the house till to-morrow— I went immediately to judge Cranch’s house, and thence to the City Hall, where I found him at his office— He called with me at Mr Seaton’s house, and then at the Office of the National Intelligencer. Mr Seaton was there, and came with us to my house; at the door of which we met. Mr Charles J. Ingersoll, with Mr Wilcocks, heretofore Consul (nominal) of the United States at Canton in China, as visitors— They made their visit short. I sent for Dr Thomas who immediately came, and went with judge Cranch, Mr Seaton and me to Mr T. B. Johnson’s house— There I read the will loud in the hearing of them-all, and it was signed by Mr Johnson, and subscribed by them as witnesses.— I came home and dined. Mr Harrison an Office hunter came after dinner and Mr Howe of Boston brought a letter from my Son— My wife was suddenly seized with pleurisy Sent for Dr Thomas, and he for De Vaughan, who cupped her, with some relief "

Saturday—  I slept, last Night in the upper chamber over that in which I write— I called at Charles J Nourse’s Office this morning, and paid him fifty dollars for William S. Smith, for which he had no note— The money had been received from Mrs De Windt and Mrs Smith who received it, thought that the best application of it would be to the payment of this debt— At the House the question was finally put on the first Resolution reported by Summers from his retrenchment Committee.— Its object was to curtail the number of subaltern clerks in the Office of the Clerk of the house from 12 to ten— Gordon and Bowne of the house New-York democracy have been two or three days opposing this resolution, fearing that the discarded Clerks will be of the democracy— Gordon had moved an amendment authorising the employment of the two additional clerks; but being pressed as to the amount of their salaries 1500 dollars each, he modified his amendment, so as to reduce the salaries to 1200 dollars each— I voted against, and it was rejected, but I voted also against the resolution which was carried by yeas and nays 144 to 16.— The report from the Secretary of the Navy was received, communicating copies of the proceedings of the Court of Enquiry, and of the Court Martial upon Captain Bolton, in answer to the Resolution offered by me, when on my trial— They were at my motion ordered to lay on the table, and to be printed— A Message from the President was received declining to communicate the documents shewing the present state of the Negotiation with Great Britain relating to the North-eastern boundary, called for by a Resolution of the house of the 21st. There was a bill from the Committee of Claims, for the relief of John Barnes on its passage, on which I debate was started— Roosevelt to get rid of it moved its recommitment to the Committee of claims with instructions, to take the opinion of the Attorney General on a point of law involved in it— I reminded the house of the answer of W. Wirt to a former house, which had required an opinion of the Attorney General, and Roosevelt withdrew his motion— D. D. Barnard told me he had received a Petition from his district signed by a small number of very respectable persons, praying for a dissolution of the Union— He said he did not know what to do with it. I urged him earnestly to present it.— I dined with him—General Scott—W. S. Archer, Mr Kerr of Maryland, Habersham of Georgia and Saltonstall were there. "

Dr Thomas was here three times in the course of this day to see Mrs Adams, who is yet confined to her bed, but convalescent— I attended this morning public worship at the Capitol expecting to hear something of a funeral discourse upon the decease of Lewis Williams; but Mr Tustin was the preacher and his text was Luke 17–32 Remember Lot’s wife— The discourse was of a general character and without funereal allusion. This injunction of Jesus to his disciples to remember Lot’s wife, was part of an awfully solemn admonition to them to expect and be prepared for persecutions, which would require the fortitude of martyrdom. Mr Tustin dwelt with impressive force upon this idea for about three quarters of an hour arguing that although the trials of the Christian’s faith in conflict with the world, were no longer the same which they were in the life and at the death of Christ, that yet trials of the same Spirit, of the same excruciating severity and requiring the same inflexible energy and persevering resistance were incidental to the lot of Christians in every age, and from which there is no exemption for our own— Enumerating these in general terms, and taking care to avoid all reference to those real conflicts of which the guilty parties cannot bear mention to be made, he ran through the commonplace invectives against the peccadilloes of modern manners, closing every paragraph of exhortation against petty transgression by repeating the command—remember Lot’s wife— The House was barely filled with hearers. Ezra Dean of Ohio sat next to me, and I enquired of him if he knew how Mr Jeremiah Morrow was this morning; as last Evening he was not expected to survive the night—he did not know— Mr Tustin told me he was a little better; and Rayner told me that Stanly was also recovering. He was taken suddenly ill yesterday morning. Mr and Mrs Angier attended at the Unitarian Church, and dined at judge Cranch’s— After dinner at St John’s Church Mr Hawley read the evening service, for the third Sunday in Lent, and preached from Philippians 2.12—“work out your own salvation with fear and trembling 13. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good will and pleasure.” After church I called at Mr T. B. Johnson’s and sat an hour in conversation with him.— Mrs Smith is there.

Wise publishes in the National Intelligencer of this Morning a long Letter to William A Graves, and a statement of circumstances attending the duel between Graves and Cilley, with the view to cast off the whole odium of it from himself upon Henry Clay.— He succeeds so far as to show that Clay must share with him the odium, and he assumes for his pretext my declaration in the house, that I believed him more guilty of the blood of Cilley than the man who drew the trigger— My opinion was founded on the fact which occurred on the field, when after two shots had been exchanged without effect, there was a parley between Wise and Jones, the seconds then it depended upon Wise alone to command the peace between them. He had but to say Gentlemen, this misunderstanding arose from words spoken by Mr Cilley in debate, and in particular debate with me—in opposing a motion made by me— The parties have met like men of honour; and twice exposed their lives upon a punctilio— This matter must proceed no further— If Mr Cilley hesitates to resort to the privilege of free debate I am bound to take it, to save the shedding of his blood or that of my friend. This was his duty as Graves’s friend and as a man; instead of which he broke off the truce with an insult, saying that if the next shot did not take effect he should propose to shorten the distance.— He now admits that he did say so, but pleads that it was by order of Graves— He should have refused to obey such an order, fit only for a savage or a fiend.— A person by the name of Mann brought me a Bill for the last volume of Hazard’s Register.— Mr and Mrs Angier and Miss Cutts rode with me to the Capitol to view the Statue of Washington. Message by Miss Cutts— In the house Robert M’Lellan moves a call on the Secretary for a report of extra allowance to General Scott in 1838. for removing the Cherokees. W. B. Campbell moves to enlarge and dilute the call—rejected. Then motion to reconsider which I opposed—laid on the table— General Resolution finally adopted— Call for petitions—beginning from Iowa moving South and then East— Giddings of Ohio, presented numerous petitions—among which one for a division, between Slavery and Freedom— House refuse to receive it— Explosion. John P. Kennedy’s mad Resolution not received— Pendleton’s—objected to.— He moves a suspension of the rules. Bustle— Winthrop moves to adjourn—carried. Evening.

Mr Gilbert Livingston Thompson had called upon me yesterday, and urgently requested me to bring before the Committee of foreign Affairs the claims and complaints against the Commission of indemnities under the convention of 1839 with Mexico.— The Commission expired last week and left much of their business undone— I met the Committee of Foreign Affairs at 10 this morning— All the members present—Adams, Cushing, Everett Granger, E. D. White Shepperd—Meriwether, Caruthers and Alexander H. H. Stuart.— There was a Letter from the Secretary of State, with an enclosure from David Porter, claiming extra-allowances, under another name, for his son, which the 5th. auditor had rejected but which the Secretary of State now acquiesces in— After some discussion this claim was laid aside— The consideration of the report on Mrs Meade’s claim was further postponed Dr Baldwin’s memorial against the Mexican indemnity commission, was then taken up, discussed, and postponed for future consideration of what the Committee can do— I thought the chairman should be directed to move in the house a call on the Department of State for the proceedings of the Commission— But the Committee were for not going so fast.— They thought it would be best to wait.— In the house, Pendleton’s motion to suspend the rules for his indignant resolution against dissolution petitions, first came up and was lost for lack of a two thirds majority, the vote being 104 to 65— Then followed attempts to introduce sundry Resolutions, and after the remainder of the morning hour absorbed on the retrenchment Committee’s report the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Briggs in the chair on the general appropriation Bill, after two abortive attempts of Bidlack of Pennsylvania, to take up the apportionment Bill. Garrett Davis with a superabundant zeal for retrenchmen, grafted upon the Bill an amendment to reduce the expense, and direct the mode of printing the Laws in pamphlets and newspapers— The Chairman pronounced it not in order, as surely it was not— But Davis appealed, and there was no quorum. The Committee rose— A call of the house produced a Quorum. Briggs resumed the Chair—debate followed till the Committee rose again and the house adjourned— Miss Cutts was here this evening—read 3 chapters of the Pickwick papers— Mr Hawley here— Mr and Mrs Angier went to the Drawing-room, which was splendid.— My wife is recovering.

Thursday  This George H Munday, is a religious fanatic or lunatic, who wears a Russian caftan— A Mooshik’s beard, a large gilt cross hung round his neck, with an inscription upon it— His conversation with me, last Night, and this Morning was interrupted by other visitors, but he repeated called on me to read the 80th. Psalm, which he insisted was prophetic of the burning of the Pennsylvania hall— Last evening he wished me to head a list of Petitioners to the Governor of Pennsylvania for the pardon of a man under sentence of death for the murder of his wife, and of a young woman for the murder of another. I declined— This morning he brought me, and urged me to sign a petition to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, to abolish capital punishments in that Commonwealth— This I also declined. He used much incoherent reasoning to convince me that man can no more forfeit than he can alienate his right to life, but the last resort of his argument was the exhortation to read the 80th. Psalm, as a plain prophesy of the burning of the Pennsylvania Hall.— Mr Giddings came, and to my satisfaction somewhat abridged the Munday lecture against capital punishment.— He came to enquire the precise extent to which I hold the subject of Slavery in the States subject to the jurisdiction of the National Government—and I explained it to him— In the case of a servile War, involving the free States of the Union, the question of emancipation would necessarily be the issue of the conflict— All war must end in peace, and peace must be concluded by Treaty— Of such a Treaty, partial or universal emancipation would probly form an essential, and the power of the President and Senate of the U.S. over it would be co-extensive with the War— Mr Radcliff came and informed me, that since his last interview with me he had received advices, that the State of the Isthmus, had reunited itself with the Republic of New-Grenada; where by his agency for the Independent State of the Isthmus had ceased— Dr Thomas and Joseph Blunt were here, and a collector of subscriptions for the last volume of Niles Register— At the house the day was consumed in the everlasting retrenchment debate— Wise produced his project for a Government printing press— His real object being to save the Tyler job of the Madisonian.

In the National Intelligencer of this morning is published the Letter of Henry Clay to the general Assembly of Kentucky dated the 16th. of last month, and resigning his Seat in the Senate of the United State to take effect from the 31st. of this month— This movement is preparatory to another, by which the whigs in Congress are to announce him as their candidate for the next Presidential election— There is in the same paper a summary of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States last week, in the case of Prigg against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, declaring null and void an Act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, and all State Laws, interfering with the recovery of fugitive Slaves— Mr and Mrs Angier went with me to the Capitol— In the house the resolutions of the retrenchment Committee on the expenditures of the house was immediately taken up— The sixth Resolution was to charge the Postmaster with contracting for horses and mail carts—adopted— The seventh charged the door keeper with the supply of fuel, oil and candles, and forbidding the use of them by the restorateurs attached to the house—adopted. The eighth charged the clerk with the purchase and supply of stationery; and to keep accounts and a record of its cost.— Winthrop moved an amendment directing the clerk to give a preference to Articles of American Manufacture— Mark A. Cooper moved an amendment, provided they are equally cheap— The Man Mountain called the yeas and nays on this amendment of Slavery against free labour, and it was carried 98 to 87.— The ninth Resolution limited the supply of stationery to each member of the house to the cost of 25 dollars to the long and 20 to the short Session—upon which arose a storm of debate—amendment was heaped upon amendment till the members scarcely knew what they were about— Holmes of Charleston S. C moved that no stationery should in future to be furnished to the members at the public expense, twice taken by yeas and nays—first carried 98 to 90. then lost 91 to 95. The resolution was at last adopted, 160 to 22—and Underwood moved a reconsideration— After which, and a resolution proposed by D. D. Barnard, for the removal of the tables and desks of the members which was not received, the house went into Committee of the whole Zadok Casey in the chair upon private bills, a great number of which were passed upon and reported—to the house. Adjourned at half past 3.— I dined at the President’s— A 4th. of March, or ex-presidential dinner. Mrs Madison, S. L. Gouverneur, his wife and daughter and myself were the relics of the past. My wife was invited, but could not go— Heads of Departments with their wives Rives and Tallmadge of the Senate, Colquitt of the house. I sat between Mrs Webster and Mrs Bodisco, opposite the President. There was an evening party at Mr Pleasonton’s, to which Mr and Mrs Angier went. "

Saturday  Mr Howe of Boston had brought me a Letter of introduction from my Son, and had assured me of the warm interest that he had taken in my recent trial, but I could then see him only for a few minutes; he came again this morning with his brother, but just then came also Mr Peter Force, and Mr Heman Lincoln, who told me that the Trustees of the Columbian College had made provision for paying off their debt to me, now, if I would receive in payment certain securities to be made equivalent to specie— This places me under the no small inconvenience of losing the interest of the money until I can reinvest it at one of the worst times I ever knew for such an operation— Virginia bank bills, now at a discount of 7 per cent, and sinking from day to day; a promisory Note of Obadiah B. Brown, and other most slippery funds are all that they can offer, and yet most of the subscriptions from which their payments must be made are conditional that the whole debt shall be paid off to-morrow— Mr Rothwell the Treasurer of the Trustees came to me at the House, but I could not make the settlement with me there He agreed to come to my house at 7. O’Clock this evening, but did not come. Elizabeth Pierce came to say that judge Underwood thought it would be most advisable not to call up this day the bill for the relief of her Sister Mrs Telfair and her; but to let it wait to come up in its turn, for a better chance to escape debate— Mr Boardman of New-Haven came and introduced to me, one of his constituents by the name of Fletcher— At the house, the Resolution to meet on and after next Monday at 11. O’Clock A.M. was after much debate reconsidered, and that hour was fixed for the first Monday in April, and after that day— A long debate then followed on the resolutions of the retrenchment Committee; regulating the distribution of stationery to the members of the house and to the Committees— Snyder moved to reduce the pay of the members to five dollars a day, and the mileage to 2 dollars for every 20 miles— The Speaker ruled this amendment out of order— Arnold moved that no more boxes should be furnished to members for packing up and sending home their books— Boardman moved to extend the interdict to tin cases for maps and charts—which Arnold accepted as a modification of his amendment— The debate wore down the patience till after three or four successive motions to adjourn, it was finally carried about 4.— Mr Leavitt spent great part of the Evening with me— I was up till past midnight reading the Letters and papers by the mail, and returned to my bed chamber.

In the hall of the house of Representatives, I heard Mr Tustin preach from Romans 5.9. [“]Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him”—a common calvinistic. A very small auditory—not half the seats of the members filled. But Mr Tustin gave notice that he should preach every Sunday morning during the Session of Congress in that hall—he afterwards said there would be preaching in the hall every Sabbath morning without previous notification in the newspapers— The omission of newspaper notification I suppose is to save Tustin the mortification of preaching to empty seats while crowds will be unable to obtain admission to hear Mr Maffit; who has been absent a fortnight lecturing in New-York and Philadelphia— I walked home, and as there was no afternoon service at St. John’s church I attended at the second presbyterian and heard Mr Moore from Matthew 16.18.—[“]and upon this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” Mr Clarke was in the pulpit, and gave out the notices of the religious meetings to be held through the ensuing week— Mr Edwin Bartlett spent the evening here a son of the late Bailey Bartlett of Haverhill; heretofore during my administration and some years after, Consul of the United States at Lima in Peru He married a miss Harrod of Portland, which brought him into intimate relations with my brother Thomas’s family.— On my recent trial Thomas W. Gilmer read a part of a Letter written by me in December 1808 to Joseph Anderson, the a Senator of the United States from the State of Tennessee— Gilmer said that he had received a copy of this Letter from a total stranger to him; he believed lately a Senator from the same State of Tennessee; not only with permission but with a request that he would use it—and accordingly he sent it to the clerk’s table and an extract from it was read— This farce appearing to make no impression upon the house, the next Morning Wise produced and held up the Letter itself, and had the same extract read again, with as little effect as before— This evening I received a Letter from J. Anderson in Tennessee stating that he is the Executor of his fathers Will, but has not yet obtained possession of his papers— That the production of my Letter by Mr Gilmer was utterly disapproved by him, and that he had learnt the fact with grief, mortification and deep indignation— So that this piece of treachery recoils upon the traitor, and is of no avail to Wise or Gilmer.

Mr Wilcocks called upon me this morning and informed me that he was an applicant for the appointment of Chargé d’Affaires in China— He said he considered the War between Great Britain and China as substantially finished— That after the capture of Amoy, there was nothing to prevent the approach of the British invading army to Pekin; and that must necessarily bring the Emperor of China Taou Kwang to terms such as the British should please to prescribe— That under such circumstances it would be culpable neglect on the part of our Government not to have an agent on the spot to watch and guard our own interests, and that he must be invested with a diplomatic character, no consular power being adequate to the emergency— I fully concurred in this opinion; but not in the confidence that the War is already terminated, or that the British would be able to dictate their own terms or that Mr Wilcocks would be the most suitable person for the mission— He was many years Consult at Canton, the memory of which would be no recommendation of him to the Chinese; and he is too old and infirm, for a mission which requires above all things youth, and vigilance, and active exertion.— At the house, Everett present a tabular statement of two rates of apportionment for representation under the new census—one of a member to 58,000—making a house of 305 members, in which no State would lose a member; and the other a ratio of 70,000 to form a house of 217 members—ordered to be printed— Gilmer, chairman of the general retrenchment Committee presented a report in part concluding with a Resolution authorising the Committee to sit during the Sessions of the house, and to send for and examine persons and papers; which was adopted The Resolutions reported by Summers’s retrenchment Committee on the expenses of the house were resumed—the 11th. and 12th. disposed of—that for establishing a standing Committee on the printing, after many amendments rejected and supplementary Resolution offered by sundry members much debated without definitive conclusion.— Then the general appropriation Bill, brought up again questions of retrenchment. Wise offered a Resolution, for the erection and establishment of a Government Press, to separate the public printing from the party Newspapers— W. Cost Johnson and D D. Barnard were spirited from removing the desks and tables from before the seats of the members—reform rages like a consuming fire— Fillmore objected to Wise’s amendment as not in order— Briggs the chairman decided that it was— Appeal taken—no Quorum; Committees rose— Adjourned. T. B. J. Frye dined with us. Dr Todsen here this evening, for a vacant office in the State Department. "

Pickens came to my seat in the house yesterday morning and told me that he had received a Letter from his particular friend General Alexander Anderson, late a Senator from Tennessee denying the statement made by T.

Gilmer that he had received from him my Letter to Joseph Anderson, which Gilmer read in the house—declaring that he utterly disapproved of the disclosure of that Letter, and requesting Pickens to publish his explicit denial of the fact that he had furnished my Letter, in the National Intelligencer and the Globe; which Pickens said he would immediately do. Accordingly the Letter from Alexander Anderson to Pickens, and one from Pickens to the editors of both papers requesting them to publish it appeared in both papers of this day. John P. Kennedy, asked me yesterday to head a list for a dinner to be given to Mr Clay immediately after his resignation— I declined, as being superannuated for all public dinners— He said the Clay flag was then to be raised—and fire away at Tyler— I said I should ask for an exposition of their principles.— Stansbury the reporter brought me yesterday a hen’s egg, from the farm of a Mr Hodges in upper Marlborough, Maryland; with WAR 1842 legibly inscribed on its shell.— He asked me to show it as a curiosity to the Committee of foreign Affairs, which I did at their meeting this morning, at which all the members, excepting Mr Meriwether of Georgia were present— This gallinaceous prophesy is an old device. I remember it from 1775— In Committee, Everett’s report on Mrs Meade’s claim was debated and with all other matters postponed— Force, Rothwell, and the Revd. Mr Adams of Baltimore, called on me at the chamber of the Committee, about the settlement of the Columbia-College debt to me— I requested them to come to my house this Evening.Heap, a Son of the late Consul at Tunis came to remonstrate against the transfer of his father as Dragoman at Constantinople. I requested him also to call at my house— The last Resolution of Summers’s retrenchment report, with sundry amendments, laid on the table yesterday was resumed this day and adopted— Numerous reports from Committees were received, and two Messages from the President; one with a report from the Secretary of the Treasury announcing empty boxes, and a call for supply. The other a second M’Leod arrest of a Canadian incendiary of the Steamer Caroline.— Referred to the Committees of Ways and Means and the judiciary— Long debate on printing in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the General Appropriation Bill— Fillmore withdrew his appeal from Briggs’s decision that Wise’s project of a Government press was in order— Wise and G. Davis withdrew their amendments, and the Committee rose. Mr and Mrs Angier went this evening to visit Mr Saltonstall’s family. Force, Rothwell, and the Revd. Mr Adams came this evening, and I agreed with them on the terms of settlement of the Columbian College debt— John Connell was here. "

Weekly meeting day of the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest.— Present Adams and Truman Smith— Habersham was in an adjoining Committee room— No Quorum— In the house, Roosevelt called in vain for the consideration of the Message received yesterday from the President, upon the cravings of an empty treasury. Halsted by privilege preference presented a report from the Committee of Elections, without announcing its purport, or to whom it related— Laid on the table and ordered to be printed.— Barnard attempted to introduce his resolution for reorganizing the hall, and discarding the desks, but failed.— The General Appropriation Bill was resumed in Committee of the whole on the Union Briggs in the chair. M’Keon offered a Resolution to repeal the land distribution Bill, but it was not received— The day was consumed in debating on the patronage of the public printing, and the contingencies of the Department of State— Caruthers, Gilmer, Fillmore, Wise, Fillmore again, Samson Mason, W. Smith, of Virginia, Cushing and Gentry shared in this discussion, in which there was sharp shooting between Gilmer and Wise on one side and Fillmore on the other. Gilmer and Wise are the backstairs Viceroys over President Tyler; and they are the busiest marplots in the house to destroy the credit of the administration and of the Country— Fillmore complained, and was answered by Gilmer by frothy braggings of independence, and by Wise with overbearing insolence and insult—till the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Mr Hassler called on me this evening, with bitter complaint that President Tyler had determined to break up his double establishment for the survey of the Coast, and for the manufacture and distribution over all the States of the Union standard weights and measures— He shewed me a Letter of notification from Walter Forward Secretary of the Treasury to Hassler’s Son dismissing him from the public service which he said Forward told him he had issued against his own will and earnest remonstrance, by express command of the President, and he said the President was equally determined to dismiss him; but he did not think he had lawful authority so to do— Mr Hassler wished me to interpose in his behalf; but that is certainly beyond the scope of my authority. Mr Rothwell the Treasurer of the Columbian College came this morning to the Committee room, and this evening to my house; and I agreed definitively with him upon the settlement of the debt from the Columbian College to me— I am to receive stocks of various descriptions and at no little hazard, in payment; to all which I have consented to assist the College in relieving them from the burden of their debt.

Mr Heap, Son of our late Consul at Tunis was again here this morning his father has been transferred from his Consulate, to be Dragoman to the American mission at Constantinople and Mr Hodgson has been appointed Consult at Tunis. But Mr Heap is exceedingly displeased at the transfer, and wishes to be reinstated, in his office as Consul at Tunis, for which his son solicits my interposition; which can be of no possible avail— Mr Radcliff was here and made some enquiries about Consular appointments, and made some remarks on the great amount of increased appropriations and expenditures of Consuls, for distressed American Seamen— Mrs Birch came to solicit again for a place for her husband to save them from being turned out of their house for non-payment of their rent. Mr Charles Dickens and his wife called and left cards, and a Letter of introduction from Mr Charles A. Davis of New-York.— Mr Leavitt and Mr Torrey were also here— At the house, no notice of the two Messages of yesterday— The appropriation bill was immediately taken up in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Briggs in the Chair; upon amendments proposed in relation to the public printing, and contingencies— In 1837—I had obtained the insertion among the rules of the house one, that no expenditure should be provided for in a general appropriation Bill, not authorised by Law— But the very next year an exception was added to the rule for contingencies, and for the continuance of works authorized by law, and from that hour the rule has been a dead Letter, and I had given up as desperate, all attempt to enforce it— Some days since Gentry of Tennessee moved to strike out of this bill, all items of appropriation not otherwise authorised by existing Law—thus falling back on my principle. This motion after much debate was carried by a large majority, but it has entangled the house in a snarl from which they will find it difficult to extricate themselves— In the item of contingent expenditure in the Department of State for printing the Laws in pamphlets and newspapers, Fillmore by direction of the Committee of Ways and Means proposed a proviso, requiring the job—printing to be done by contract with the lowest bidder, and Garrett Davis moved an amendment that the Laws should be published in the Newspapers having the largest circulation— This was a cut and thrust at the Madisonian, a Tyler Newspaper, with about 300 subscribers and kept alive only by the patronage of printing for the public offices— This was the stimulant of Wise’s furious onset upon Fillmore yesterday, met and repelled this day by Gentry amid numberless interruptions by Wise, and by the chairman Briggs himself truckling to the overbearing temper of Wise— Gentry Caruthers, Charles Brown, Gilmer, Everett and Cushing took part in this debate followed by one started by Giddings a touch upon Slavery which set all the South in a flame, till the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— Mr Nathaniel Tallmadge one of the Senators from New-York, came into the house with Charles Dickens and called me out from my seat and introduced him to me— I dined with Robert C. Winthrop and John P. Kennedy— They went expressly to Dickens’s lodgings at Fuller’s to prevail on him to come and dine with them; but he was at dinner and they did not see him— William S. Archer, Millard Fillmore, Pearce of Maryland, Mrs S. P. Gardner, Mr and Mrs F. C. Lowell were of the party— Mrs Winthrop did not appear till after dinner— Walk home. Elizabeth C.

Mr Leavitt called this morning, and told me that as there appeared to be at present an interval of leisure from discussions of much interest to the cause of liberty he proposed to avail himself of it, to pay a visit to his family. The Intelligencer of this morning contains the Letter of Joshua R. Giddings to the Legislature of Ohio, in answer to their infamous factious resolutions of censure upon me for presenting the Haverhill Petition— In the House Wise offered a Resolution for a select Committee of five to consider and report upon the expediency and propriety of separating the patronage of the Government from the private and political press and on the best mode of effecting that purpose adopted without opposition— So was a Resolution offered by Joseph R. Ingersoll, instructing the judiciary Committee to enquiry into the expediency of reporting a bill for selecting juries in States where obstacles are interposed by the local laws. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Briggs in the Chair— General Appropriation Bill— Stanly moved to strike out the item of appropriation for the Salary of the first Auditor of the Treasury and his clerks— Jesse Miller of Pennsylvania is the Auditor; and in the report of Wise’s Committee of investigation, into the Swartwout defalcation, Miller was charged with culpable negligence and incompetency; in not discovering Swartwouts embezzlements— Stanly modified his motion, to strike out only the auditor’s own salary and sent to the clerk a speech of Proffit’s made two years ago, vehemently denouncing the Van Buren administration for retaining Miller in office. A ludicrous debate now followed, between Proffit—Charles Brown, Wise, and John C. Clark; succeeded by John G. Floyd, Underwood, Gordon, Arnold, and Holmes of South Carolina, in which Proffit boasted that his speech had elected half the whigs in the house, and Charles Brown said Ogle’s speech had elected the other half.— Linn of New-York finally took the floor; the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— Cruit was here with his claim, and Mr Rothwell brought me a mortgage of Obadiah B Brown, as security for the note of Withers, and a release of the bond and mortgage of the Columbian College; which he left with me, to be called for in the course of the next week to complete the final settlement of that concern— Evening visits from Mrs Thornton, Mrs Talbot and her son and daughter. I was obliged to leave them for my chamber— "

Saturday  Mr Kavasales came here; solicitous to ascertain why the Senate still linger about taking up and passing upon the nomination of him as a chaplain in the Navy of the United States. He intimated a suspicion of two causes as throwing obstacles in his way—one was that Mr Tyler had nominated with him another personal, relation of his own, for the same office, and the other that an undue proportion of episcopalians were appointed to these chaplaincies.— Mr Pitchlyme is a Choctaw Indian—a half breed of lighter complection than many Spaniard, and so well educated that he delivers public lectures here: he came to complain of abuses practised in the application of the annuities and pension funds to which his tribe are entitled by the Treaties, and Laws, and to request the exercise of my influence in their favour— There was also a young man from the wine merchantSemmes— At the house, Willis Green of Kentucky offered a Resolution instructing the Committee of Ways and Means to enquire into the expediency of increasing the duties upon wines, silks, linens and luxuries generally to twenty per cent ad valorem, and twenty percent more annually, imported from countries levying a heavy duty on tobacco, imported from the United States, until they shall reduce their duties to the level of our Standard— Mark A. Cooper enquired if it was in order— John Campbell objected to its reception— Green moved a suspension of the rules; failed, and his resolution was not received— Fillmore obtained leave to offer from the Committee of Ways and Means sundry amendments to the loan bill, which were laid on the table, and ordered to be printed. The order of the day was on the question of printing a report from the judiciary Committee against a supplement to the Bankrupt Law to include corporations— But Roosevelt yielded the floor and private business was taken up— 50 bills passed to be engrossed. 30. house bills passed— 6 Senate bills passed, and 10 bills laid aside for debate— The house adjourned before 3. O’Clock. William Johnson, a Son of Alexander B. Johnson of Utica, New-York brought me a Letter from his father and dined with us— Mr Weems called on me about the printing of the compendium of the census— I advised him to see Mr Giddings, chairman of the Committee of claims— I returned to Mr Stansbury his War egg.

Sunday—  Morning service at the Presbyterian Church— Mr Moore made the prayer; and Mr Clarke preached from Luke 15.10— “There is joy in the presence of the angels of God, over one sinner that repenteth.”— Mr. Clarke observed that the existence of Angels, ministering Spirits was a fact revealed to us in the holy scriptures; and of which there is no other evidence— He referred to several passages of the old and new covenant in which these mysterious persons are mentioned and some of them are named— But he did not enter deeply into the subject, nor descant upon the War in Heaven, by which one third of this celestial hierarchy rebelled against the Lord God omnipotent.— Matter for meditation— My wife had sent an invitation to Mr and Mrs Dickens to dine with us this day at half past two— They were engaged to dine with Mr Greenhow at 5. but Mrs Dickens answered that they would come and take their lunch with us at our dining hour— They came accordingly— I had invited Barnard, Saltonstall, Stanly and Winthrop to meet them—and Walter Hellen— Granger had also promised to come, but was detained by the arrival of some of his friends from New-York— Mr and Mrs Dickens left us about 4. O’Clock.— They are so beset with civilities, and kind attentions, that they have not a moment of time to spare, and it was only by snatching an hour from other engagements that they could see us at all— Dickens’s fame has been acquired, by sundry novels and popular tales published in England under the name of Boz—republished in this country in many newspapers, and more universally read perhaps than any other writer who ever put pen to paper— He came out in the January steamer to Boston, and his reception has transcended that of La-Fayette in 1824. Our other guests remained with us till dark. William Johnson came to tea— Mr and Mrs Francis Bartlett, Mr Edwin Bartlett, and Richard D. Cutts, and his Sister in the Evening— News from England— The Caledonia safe— Creole case in the house of Lords. "

D. Barnard, from the Committee on the judiciary reported a Bill to provide for the selection and return of jurors for the courts of the United States where they have not been able to conform the designation and empannelling in substance to the local laws and usage—this bill of deeper import in its bearing upon the laws of the States than the house was aware of; was driven through, with out discussion, by the suspension of the rules, and by three several previous questions— Cave Johnson presented petitions for the repeal of the Bankrupt Law; and moved their reference to the judiciary Committee with instructions to report forthwith a bill to suspend the operation of the act till the 3d. of March next— Chittendan moved to lay the motion on the table—lost 89. to 96—previous question called lost—81 to 87. no second, and the motion lies over for debate— Morgan presented a petition, praying as an alternative the rescinding of the 21st. rule or the dissolution of the Union— Not received— Barnard presented a Petition, for the dissolution of the Union, and moves its reference to a select Committee with instructions to report adversely to its prayer.

Mr Everett’s plan for reducing the number of diplomatic missions abroad was taken up, and read— Cushing started an objection to the consideration of the subject, denying the right of the Committee to consider any thing not referred to them by the house— I then moved that the chairman be instructed to move in the house the reference to the Committee again of the Resolution of 29 August last, proposing a reduction of the diplomatic missions abroad, upon which the Committee make no report at the extra Session— Cushing’s objection was overruled—supported only by his own vote. The instruction was given, and I made the motion in the house; immediately after the reading of the Journal— Cushing objected— I moved a suspension of the rules to enable me to make the motion— Cushing cavilled and quibbled upon the points of order, which the Speaker decided against him— He called the motion for reference a Report, and argued that no Committee could report upon any thing not referred to them by the house— Yorke moved the previous question— The yeas and nays were called and were 173 to 6 for the reference— I notified the members of the Committee to meet next Thursday morning at 10.— Stanly and Botts offered Resolutions respecting the Coast-wise navigation of the Mail-Steamers—adopted.

Nourse at 92 1/2 per cent payable in Virginia bank paper at a discount of 7 per cent for specie. Mr Nourse charging 1/2 of 1. per cent or 10 dollars for brokerage— I paid 1000 dollars in the draught of Heman Lincoln, in favour of S. Chapin, on the Merchant’s Bank at Boston— 200 dollars in Virginia and Philadelphia Bank Notes, and 536. dollars in a check on the Bank of the Metropolis upon a deposit of the Speaker White’s order of 500 dollars furnished me last Tuesday and one of the same amount before, of which there still remained a balance of 200 dollars in the bank— I had yesterday offered the Speaker’s last check of 500 dollars, to Major Nourse, towards the balance of payment for the corporation stock, and claimed the premium of 7 percent on it as specie— Nourse declined allowing more than 5 per cent agio upon it saying that the Speaker’s draughts were paid in Treasury Notes on which the current discount was 2 1/2 percent— So I took back my Speaker’s check, deposited it this morning in the Metropolis bank, and asked if they would pay it in their own bills— Richard Smith the Cashier declined; saying that they paid specie for their own Bills—but their only public funds were treasury notes, which were at a discount of 2 1/2 percent— I then called again at Nourse’s office and offered him a check of 536 dollars on the Bank of the Metropolis, for the balance of specie due for the corporation stock, and told him that if the depretiation of 2 1/2 per-cent had taken place since the sale of the Stock last Monday, I could not be responsible for it, and if he declined taking my check as specie, I must cancel the bargain and demand repayment of what I had paid— He then took my check for specie and promised to send me the certificates in the course of the day— Instead of which, he sent me an order of Corcoran Riggs upon Wiltberger the City register for the Stock.— I called on the Secretary of State, and left with him a copy of the Resolution of the house of 29. August 1841. looking to a reduction of the number of the diplomatic missions abroad—and the tabular statement of specific deductions proposed by Horace Everett— Mr Webster manifested a very warm disposition for economy and rentrenchment in the abstract, but an equally warm aversion to any specific reduction— After sufficient conversation with him to ascertain his propensities, I told him I should in the course of the day, address a Letter to him referring to the Resolution of the House and requesting in behalf of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, his views upon the subject, as early as he could conveniently make it, that it might be in time for consideration on the passage of the general appropriation bill— I spoke to him also, about a claim of allowance of a charge in an account of David Porter, Minister Resident at Constantinople; which he himself had referred to the Committee of foreign affairs, but of which he evidently knew nothing; and I mentioned to him information I had received of an angry correspondence between the British Consult and ours upon a charge against a Captain of an American vessel of having sold at the Havana, three coloured Seamen, whom he had ship’d at the Cape de Verd Islands, as freemen.— Mr. Webster conveyed to me ambiguously the idea that this was entirely new information to him, and that he knew nothing about it— I saw clearly that he did know, what he did not chuse to tell me— He said he had received yesterday despatches from our Consul at the Havana James S. Calhoun, but had not yet read them. He took up a Letter upon his table, and read in silence some part of it, and then laid it down, and said nothing— He sent me back this evening the Resolution of the house, and H.

I took the order of Corcoran Riggs this morning to the City Hall— Mr Wiltberger the Register was there, and kept me upwards of an hour, making out four certificates of Corporation 6 per cent Stock, amounting to 2000 dollars, which he delivered to me.— The Mayor, W. W. Seaton was not at his office, and Wiltberger told me would not be there this day. The Meeting of the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest was fixed for 10 this morning, but it was 11. when I reached the chamber of the Committee and found there, Underwood, Habersham, Truman Smith, Benjamin Randall and Charles J. Ingersoll— Absent Bowne, Houston and Hunter. Of my tardiness, I failed not to be reminded— We took up the old bill, and debated it from the third to the sixth Section inclusive. Every provision, of every section was contested; and the only sound principle settled was that the principal sum of the bequest should be preserved unimpaired as a perpetual fund, from which no appropriation shall be made— Habersham of Georgia opposed the parts of the Bill providing for the establishment of an Astronomical Observatory— His argument was the danger and difficulty of carrying it through Congress— And he said that only yesterday one of the members from the South urged in conversation with him that Congress had no constitutional power to accept the bequest, and that the money ought to be sent back to England. I saw the finger of John C. Calhoun and of nullification; and said that the objection against the power of Congress to accept the bequest would not be removed, by striking out the observatory— That Mr Calhoun and his co-adjutors had urged it from the beginning and it had been time after time settled against them— That any application of the fund to the purposes of the testator would be resisted by them, and if any thing was to be done it must be carried against their stubborn opposition. Adjourned to Monday Morning at 10. H.R. Debate on John T. Mason’s motion to reconsider the rejection of a bill for the relief of the legal representatives of Francis Eppes—refused 82 to 90. Underwood urges to take up and pass upon the Senate’s amendment to the District Bank Bill—fails.— Several Executive Communications and Bills from the Senate read and referred— Private business set aside for Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Ward in the chair on the loan bill. Proffit rails nearly two hours against the whigs and abruptly concludes— After the Committee rose, interloping sundries till the adjournment. Joseph H. Adams dined at our house— I dined at B. O. Tayloe’s parting dinner to Mr Clay. Mrs Dickinson there— Mrs Tayloe’s book of Autographs. "

Mrs Dickinson, her mother has been passing the winter with here.— The persons at this dinner were the principal partizans of Mr Clay in both houses of Congress; and I suppose are to be among the principal figures of the undertaking to bring out Mr Clay as the whig candidate for the next Presidential election— This morning I went with Mrs. Angier and Elizabeth C. Adams to the Capitol, where, being rather belated, we found Mr Maffitt preaching to a crowded auditory from Luke 24.27. “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.”— This was the second of three Sermons, the first of which he had delivered last Sunday, and the third of which he promised for the next, on the union of the divine and the human nature in the person of Jesus Christ— He kept up the interest, and rivetted the attention of his auditory through the whole discourse— There is extreme apparent earnestness in his manner, but I cannot escape from the impression, that he believes not a word of what he says.— He assumed that the whole bible from the first chapter of Genesis to the last of the apocalypse has continual reference to the double nature, the divine and the human character of Jesus Christ— He marked the coincidence between the creation of light in the first chapter of Genesis, and the resurrection of Lazarus by Jesus; the very moment after the manifestation of humanity by weeping at the grave of Lazarus— One of the quaint remarks of Mr Maffitt was that when Jesus rose from the Sepulchre, he left a napkin behind to wipe away the tears from the eyes of his faithful disciples.— After dinner I went to St. John’s Church and heard Mr Hawley read the Evening service for the Sunday before Easter, or Palm Sunday, and preach from Matthew 11.29—“learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your Souls.—[”] After church I went to Mr T. B. Johnson’s and spent a couple of hours in conversation with him— Evening visits from Joseph H. Adams, Mr Cutts—Mr and Mrs Greenough, and Walter Hellen— "

Present Adams, Underwood, Truman Smith, Habersham, B. Randall and C. J. Ingersoll—absent Bowne, Houston and Hunter.— We discussed the remainder of the old Bill, from the 6th. Section through— Every one had amendments to propose, and the bill was thoroughly riddled— Many amendments were adopted, and I was directed to prepare an amended bill for the consideration of the Committee, at the adjournment, Wednesday Morning— Mr and Mrs Angier had departed in the Cars for Baltimore at 6. O’Clock this morning, for home at Medford— On the adjournment of the Committee I found the house in Session— Milton Brown reported from the Committee—I found the house in Session—Milton Brown reported from the Committee on the judiciary a bill, respecting the U.S. District Court in West-Tennessee, which passed through all its stages without examination or opposition— Cross of Arkansas then offered a Bill to give to the District Court in that State the powers of the Circuit Court, on the avowed ground, that the judge of the Supreme Court within whose Circuit that State is situated never has attended there; and Cross said he deserved to be, and ought to be impeached. I thought this no sufficient reason for increasing the jurisdiction of the District judge, but I reluctantly consented to the introduction of the bill, that it might be referred to the judiciary Committee. The question upon Stanly’s Resolution, giving the house power by a majority to take at discretion any bill out of the Committee of the whole, after several attempts to evade it, was finally carried 105 to 98— In the call for Resolutions, Andrews of Kentucky moved an inquiry of the President and heads of Departments for the names of all the members of Congress who have applied for offices by themselves or their friends, of the 25th. or 26th. Congresses; and specifying the office applied for in each case— Giddings of Ohio offered a series of resolutions relating to Slavery and the Creole case— Ward, moved the previous question. Everett moved to lay them on the table—lost by yeas and nays 52 to 128— Everett moved a call of the house—refused— After much turbulence and confusion, Giddings withdrew the Resolutions. Botts then moved a suspension of the rules to offer a Preamble and Resolution of censure upon Giddings, yeas 128. Nays 68. Not two thirds. Weller of Ohio then offered the same resolution it being still the turn of the State, and he moved the previous question— The question whether Giddings should be heard in his defence was unsettled at the adjournment.

P. Van Ness as Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain was taken up, partly considered and postponed for certain additional papers, which Mr Van Ness requests may be obtained at the Department of State— In the house the resolution of censure upon Giddings, with a preamble, first moved yesterday by Botts, then moved by Weller; moving at the same time the previous question, was taken up, and after two full hours of twistings, decisions by the Speaker, reversed by the house; motions that he should have permission to be heard in his defence, by reconsideration; by suspension of the rules, by general consent the resolution of censure was actually passed by yeas and nays 125 to 69— And then the preamble was adopted 119 to 66— I can find no language to express my feelings at the consummation of this act— Immediately after the second vote Giddings rose from his seat, came over to mine; shook cordially my hand; and took leave— I had a voice only to say—I hope we shall soon have you back again. He made no reply, but passed to the seats of other members his friends, and took leave of them as he had done of me— I saw him shake hands with Arnold, who voted against him. He then left the house, and this evening the City— The house then refused to adjourn, and went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the loan bill till they failed of a quorum, when the Committee rose and the house adjourned.— Mr and Mrs Frye and Major Wade Hall, Howard, Hudson and Borden were here this evening.

Signed by the Presidents of many insurance companies and other merchants in Boston, New-York Philadelphia and Baltimore; and also an exposition of the rupture of ten years standing between the Governments of the United States, and of the Argentine Republic, on account of the invasion by Captain Duncan, and of the Falkland Island in 1831.

I was finally directed to prepare a Bill and then call a meeting of the Committee— In the house, upwards of two hours were consumed in debating sundry amendments proposed to the journal of the proceedings of yesterday—among the rest, my appeal from the decision of the Speaker that the previous question, cut off from Mr Giddings his right of self defence, was not noticed on the journal, though it was correctly reported in the National Intelligencer of this morning— I moved an amendment of the Journal stating the fact of the Speaker’s denying my apppeal— I called the yeas and nays which were 42 to 110. but the facts are now stated on the journal of this day— The other motions to amend the journal were laid on the table Wise withdrew his proposed amendment stating the fact that he had refused to vote on the resolution of censure.

I told them that Slavery, the support the perpetuation, and the propagation of Slavery was at the root of the whole system of policy of the present administration— That an essential part of this system was hostility to the manufactures, and to the free labour of the North— That this Spirit, in alliance with the mock democracy of the free States exercises now absolute controul over the majority of both houses of Congress, and if unable to carry all its purposes into execution now, will at least defeat every measure which could contribute to promote the manufacturing interest or the domestic industry of free labour— Of Mr Sprague’s opinions I had been partially apprized, and from his disclosure of them at this interview, I perceive that his visit to Washington at this time has other objects in view besides the duty upon cordage— Mr Uzzielli is an Italian philosophical traveller from Leghorn, who last Summer brought me a letter of introduction from Mr De Tocqueville at Paris, and who now brought me one from Alexander H. Everett dated the 5th. of this month at New-Orleans— Since the summer Mr Uzzielli has travelled over a great part of the United States, and he proposes to complete his tour, so as to return to Europe next July. He appears sensible and candid, and I had a free confidential conversation with him on our present financial and political condition— I went with Elizabeth C. Adams to the city Hall, where Mr David A. Hall took her acknowledgment of a Deed of some stock in the Boston South cove corporation, which my Son had sent her in blank. I then left her at Mrs Greenough’s door and repaired to the Capitol— It was one of the days devoted by the rules of the house to private business, but they went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Ward in the Chair, on the loan-bill. Wise resumed the floor, and delivered four hours and a half of unmeasured bitter, rancorous invective upon Fillmore, Marshall, and the whole body of the manifesto whigs—he was suffered to go on without call to order, and with scarce a word of interruption, till just upon 5 when he sat down, and at least 30 members started up— The Speaker gave the floor to Gentry. The Committee rose, and the house adjourned— "

Easter Sunday— Clear, cool, bright, sunshine with all the elements of physical nature attempered as if for the enjoyment of human life, to contrast with the dark, gloomy, tempestuous and terrific aspect of the moral and political world— I went with my daughter Mary Catherine, her daughter Mary Louisa, and my niece Elizabeth C. Adams, to the Capitol where we heard the chaplain of the house Maffitt preach the third of four successive Sermons, on the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ— His text this morning was Romans 9.5. “Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.” The reading should be “blessed be God forever—” and it is upon equivocations like this, that rests all the scriptural authority for deifying Jesus of Nazareth— Mr Maffitt’s discourse like that of the last Sunday was ingenious; eloquent, sagacious in the selection of his authorities from the Testaments old and new.— He seemed to make a deep impression on his auditory, 9.10ths. of whom were already believers of his creed; but he acknowledged he had nothing new to say in support of his doctrine, he acknowledged that it had no support of evidence, except from the scriptures, and he adduced no testimony that I had not seen and heard before— And since I read Massillon’s sermon on the same subject thirty years bygone, I have been inaccessible to any argument to gain the belief of that which he had failed to establish— Mr Maffitt announced that he should preach his fourth and concluding sermon on this subject next Sunday— The floor of the house was crowded almost to choaking; but there were few persons in the galleries— I walked home and stop’d at Gadsby’s, Brown’s and Fuller’s hotel’s to enquire for Mr Seth Sprague junr. for whom I had received last evening a Letter from Mr Jacob H. Loud at Plymouth—but he lodged at neither of those houses— Joseph H. Adams dined with us. In the afternoon at St. John’s church Mr Hawley read the evening service for Easter Sunday, and preached from Ezekiel 34:16. [“]I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up, that which was broken, and will strengthen, that which was: but I will destroy the fat and the strong: I will feed them with judgment.” Call at Mr Johnson’s after church; but he was riding out— "

Congress afterwards Mayor of Albany, and now at 76 years of age a private citizen, yet in vigorous health— The two Townsend’s, his companions, I believe are father and son— Mr Kavasales, came and took leave of me—having at last received his commission, and about departing for New-York, there to await orders— He expressed his gratitude to me, for my assistance in obtaining his commission, and said he should make it his earnest endeavour by his conduct to prove himself worthy of the interest I had taken in his favour.— Then came Mr Samuel H Walley, with Mr Hastings, and a Mr Webber— Mr Walley is a very active politician in Massachusetts; was sometime Speaker of the House of Representatives at the late Session of the Massachusetts Legislature, and has now some commission from Governor Davis to urge the recovery here of the Massachusetts claim— These visits detained me, all the morning til the time came for attending the house. Elizabeth C. Adams went with me to the Capitol, and then to judge Cranch’s, where she dined, having in the interval, with her brother visited the gallery of the house— It was the day for the reception of Petitions, but Fillmore moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the loan-bill, which was carried by yeas and nays 122 to 53.— Gentry of Tennessee had the floor from Saturday; and replied in a speech of two hours to Wise— He was followed by another two hours speech of Rayner, of North-Carolina— The floor was then taken by Colquitt of Georgia at whose motion the Committee rose by a vote of 62 to 59 above quorum.— Lane of Indiana then announced his desire to speak, and Colquitt consented to let him have the floor for the remnant of this day; reserving it for himself to-morrow So the house went into Committee again Ward in the Chair and Lane made his speech of about an hour And it was near 6 when the house adjourned— Mr Dorr was here in the evening, and gave me an account of the state of political affairs at Buenos Ayres and Montevideo; and very anxious to ascertain what prospect there is of the reinstitution of a diplomatic mission to the Argentine Republic.

Mary and Elizabeth were in the room, and immediately retired. The secret that he had to reveal to me was that he with a wife and two children were starving for want of bread; and he himself for want of employment— In search of this he had come two years since from Germany, and resided chiefly at Philadelphia— He was a Hanoverian—had studied physic at the University of Gottigen, and had lived some part of his time by teaching.— He had been reduced to the necessity of selling his library, and even as much of his cloathing as he could spare with decency.— He could spare no more, and his wants were bread and employment.— It is melancholy to think to how many unfortunates even in this country a precisely similar tale applies; and deeply distressing to me, that I have power to afford them no permanent relief. I attended at 10 this morning the meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs; all the members present except Mr Meriwether; but two or three were belated an hour or more, and Cushing came in as the Committee were about to adjourn— The resolution of enquiry into the expediency of reducing the number of diplomatic missions abroad, was considered— No answer had been received from the Secretary of State to my Letter of enquiry and some sensibility was manifested at the delay— Mr Everett said that with the verbal information from me, of the aversion of the Secretary of State to any reduction, he should not press the further consideration of his tabular statement, nor mark any one particular mission, for suppression; but he moved that the chairman be directed to prepare a report to the house upon the resolution to be submitted to the consideration of the Committee; which was adopted— There was some conversation upon the claims of David Porter and C. P. Van Ness, but no action. In the house there was adopted at my motion a resolution for the sending of all petitions to the Clerk’s table, to be disposed of by the Speaker; and all admissible under the rule to be referred to the appropriate Committees— Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, Ward in the chair upon the loan-bill Colquitt—Shields—William Smith, Cushing, in reply to the speakers of yesterday—and M’Kean— At 8. O’Clock Atherton took the floor.— The Committee rose and the house adjourned— I came home and found Miss Cutts here. Her brother Richard came in afterwards— He had been this Evening at the President’s house, and found Robert Tyler in profound admiration of Caleb Cushing’s Speech. "

Mr William Brent called on me this morning, and as the legal representative of his deceased brother Daniel Brent, who died Consul of the United States at Paris, mentioned that he had a claim for extra diplomatic services during a period of 12 Months, while there was no minister of the United States in France; that is from the return of Edward Livingston home till the appointment of Lewis Cass and his arrival at Paris— He asked my advice what he should do for the prosecution of this claim, and I said I knew of no other course than to present a memorial to Congress setting forth the claim, accompanied with the vouchers in its support— He said he would prepare the Memorial and requested me to present it, which I readily promised to do.— I called at the Treasury Department, wishing to see the Secretary, Mr Forward; but he was sick, and not there— I enquired of M’Clintock Young the Chief Clerk, concerning the resolution of the house adopted at my motion at the extra Session last Summer, calling for a report from the Secretary of the Treasury, on the debts of the States— He said that there were several of the States from which no answers have yet been received. There are probably several from which no returns will be received— The report then is not to be expected soon— But he shewed me tabular statements of the debts of several of the States from which answers have been received— I spoke to him also of the appointment of a Surveyor of the customs at Boston and requested that it might not be made on a recommendation of mine made before the death of President Harrison. I then proceeded to the pension Office, and left with the Commissioner Edwards a Letter requesting the return of a certificate of marriage of a Mrs Heston deposited there as a voucher for an unsuccessful claim to a pension— He will report to me concerning it— Call at the Headquarters of the Commander in chief of the army— General Scott himself is gone to New-York— The adjutant general Roger Jones opened the Letter, from Minott Thayer which I left with him—soliciting the discharge of a poor thief and deserter imprisoned for trial— At the Office of the Secretary of War.— Left there the application of Isaac Little Hedge junr of Plymouth for a warrant of Cadet at the West-Point Academy, and requested that his name might be entered on the books of the Department as a Candidate promised but with warning of no hope of success.— At the house Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Ward in the chair on the loan-Bill— Atherton occupied the floor from 12 to 2 with snarling sophistication repeated by rote from Woodbury. The chairman’s hammer then knocked him down— Two hours were consumed in the rejection of silly captious amendments and the bill was reported to the house. After a short exposition from Fillmore W. Cost Johnson moved the previous question, and the house adjourned. "

Time presses heavily upon me— I receive an average of 8 Letters every day of which I am unable to answer at least 7. and of which it is no light task even to keep an assorted file— The little leisure of this morning was consumed in commencing an alphabetical file for the month, now closed— I called at the General Post-Office, and delivered to Mr Wickliffe, the petition for a granite post-office at Quincy, which I received some days since, from my son; and of which Mr Justin Spear is proposed to be the Postmaster— Mr Wickliffe said there was no instance of the establishment of a new Post-Office in Country towns, within 3 miles of another—that the usual rule was 5 miles—and I told him that the distance of the Post-Office at Quincy from the quarries is less than two miles— I read to Mr Wickliffe the Letter from Mr Thomas Loring, recommending Mr Whiton, and that from Jotham Lincoln; recommending Rufus Lincoln as Postmaster at Hingham— He sent for the recommendations received at the Office, of which there were 26. for Whiton 52 for Lincoln, and 50 for Joseph Hobart. He said he should suspend his decision upon the appointment for a few days— Mr Ambrose Spencer came in while I was there.— At the house the reports of sundry Committees were received among which are from L. Saltonstall, chairman of the Committee of Manufactures, with a Tariff bill; which was read twice; referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and ordered to be printed—with the report counter report and documents and 5000 extra-copies— Habersham, and A. V. Brown, make the minority report— Then Clifford’s call of the house came up and 196. members answered— Previous question on the engrossment of the land-bill. The principal amendment reported by the Committee, authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to sell the stock of the loan under par was lost by yeas and nays 97 to 99. The other amendments were carried, by majorities of 8 or more— Before the vote on the engrossment of the bill was taken, two of the whigs who had voted against the vital amendment were rallied back to their party, and then there was a whimsical perplexity how they should reverse their own decision— They were compelled first to pass the engrossment—then to reconsider that, then to reconsider the vote rejecting the amendment and then to adopt the amendment by 99 to 97. two votes changing the majority—the bill finally passed 103 toSundry executive communications were received. Arnold moved a reconsideration of the vote passing the bill to prevent its being successfully made on the other side, and it was rejected— Adjourned at 4. Henry Clay delivered a formal valedictory speech and resigned his Seat in the Senate— This Evening R. I. Morsell came to make his annual payment—but is to call again to-morrow. "

I had not, but promised to do it soon, and to send it to him.— Mr Sessford came and gave me a certificate of honorary membership of the Perseverance fire company; with which was coupled a claim of 5 dollars annual contribution, which I fully believed I had paid ten or twelve days ago— But he said he had called for it, and for want of change— I had asked him to call again, which invitation I was obliged this day to repeat. Mr Morsell came and made the annual payment of 300 dollars, upon the agreement for the purchase of my house but I was obliged to take in payment a due-bill certificate signed by M.

Virginia bank bills are now the only currency passable in this city, except small notes of 1 and 2 dollars, 50, 25 and 12 1/2 cents issued by individual merchants or brokers, who occasionally break and leave thousands of dollars of waste paper in their notes— At the house, the day was again devoted to private business, and as usual in such cases a bare quorum was present at any part of the day.— The Committee of the whole had risen yesterday, upon a motion to report a multitude of bills but leaving them in Committee for want of a quorum to report them— This morning the house went into committee of the whole for the sole purpose of reporting them— They were reported, and the day was consumed in carrying them through the stages of engrossment and enactment save one which was rejected by yeas and naystoThis was dull pastime, and I made the experiment of doing something else, while the routine of private legislation was dragging through— I accordingly continued the draught of a Bill for the Smithsonian bequest Committee, with a hope to finish it on Monday; and I ascertained that I might with suitable industry, perform the work of two hours writing, in my seat, upon business other than that before the house every day upon which I take no part in the debate, and yet give all necessary attention to the current business of the house.— A day or two after the censure upon Giddings there were in the National Intelligencer, some editorial remarks, disapproving the proceedings of the house in that case. Some days after, an Article written by Botts, signed “a Member,” justifying the action of the house, and complaining of the editorial comments— In the Intelligencer of this morning there is an article in reply to that of Botts, and signed “another member” so well written, that I was desirous of ascertaining its author— Gates and Slade, alternately charged it upon each other but Gates afterwards found that it was Hiland Hall— Another disclosure appears in the Anti-Slavery standard of 31. March—that Saltonstall was the member of Congress, who chilled the ardour of the Massachusetts Legislature for my defence, by a seasonable hint that it might cloud the prospects of the Massachusetts claim upon which Preston of S.C. is the reporter to the Senate— Dr. Hall was here this evening, and enquired about the claim of Alexander Hammett, Consul at Naples, before the Committee of foreign Affairs— I received from H.

With my wife, Mrs John Adams and Elizabeth I attended the morning public worship at the Capitol, in the expectation of hearing Mr Maffitt’s fourth Sermon upon the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ—instead of which Dr Eliphalet Nott, President of the Methodist Union college, at Schenectady— New-York preached from Matthew 16.26. “For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man gain in exchange for his soul?” It is impossible for two men to preach the same gospel, with means and manners more different than those of Mr Maffitt and of Dr Nott— The discourse this day was argumentative—accumulative—figurative—progressive—full of amplification and of pathos—apparently extemporaneous, but deeply studied, strictly methodical, and repeated by heart, without notes.— A definition of the soul—a contrasted view of the finite and the infinite— Of Time and Eternity. Remarks upon the progressive nature of the Soul, from infancy to decrepitude and death—a perhaps, that this progress continues after death, through endless ages.— Not likely. Something about Cherubim and Seraphim—Michael—Uriel, Gabriel and Raphael— Mysterious personages.— The Doctor opened an account current between the Soul and the whole world, and struck a balance infinite in amount in favour of the soul; proving the exchange between them worse than that between Virginia Bank bills and standard gold— Mr Maffitt announced that he should preach his sermon, on the humanity of Christ, next Sunday.— Passed Midshipman Joseph H Adams dined with us. He has taken the temperance pledge till the 1st. of January next— Dr Thomas paid us a morning visit— After dinner, at St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley read prayers for the first Sunday after Easter, and Mr Crusoe of Philadelphia preached from Hebrews 2.3. “How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation.”— After church, I went with my wife over, and spent an hour, with her brother T. B. Johnson I gave to Mrs W. S. Smith, the quit-claim deed received last evening from my son, to be executed by Mr and Mrs Smith; and I paid her the balance of 3 dollars on the bills for 50 paid to C. J. Nourse, for which I gave her my receipt, having myself that of Nourse; and I agreed with her that I would pay to Cruit the 59.47. for W. S. Smith, upon his executing the Quit-claim— Mrs Smith gave me to read, a Letter two days since received from her husband in which he says that upon a word from her he will come back.— As we were returning home we met a carriage laden with two travelling trunks; part of the baggage of Lord Ashburton, once Alexander Baring, who arrived last Evening in the Warspite—from England—whence he now comes as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary upon a special mission.

Attended at 10 this morning the meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Present Adams, Everett Stuart, Shepperd, Caruthers, and just as the Committee were about to adjourn, Cushing— They had but one hour; for from this day forward the daily hour of meeting of the house is 11.— The answer of the Secretary of State to my Letter of enquiry was discussed— I moved that the Chairman be directed to report the answer itself; with the simple addition that they deem it inexpedient to propose any diminution of the appropriations for the diplomatic service of the present year.— The Committee were however not satisfied with this— They appeared disposed to scrutinize further, and to call for specific reasons for the continuance of each separate mission. It was finally agreed that the chairman should confer verbally again with the Secretary of State, and ask some explanation of apparent assumptions in his answer which were considered of questionable accuracy— Cushing observed that the increase of expenditures in the diplomatic department had been much less than in all the others; and that the suppression of diplomatic missions were not promotive of much economy, as they usually gave rise to a claim for diplomatic compensation to consuls— The Committee adjourned to meet again to-morrow morning— At the house, it was the day for the reception of resolutions; but Joseph R. Ingersoll, a member of the Committee of Ways and Means, in behalf of Fillmore the chairman, who is deaf, moved to go into Committee of ways and means the whole on the state of the Union, which was carried— Thompson of Indiana in the chair— Cushing moved to take up his exchequer bill—but the Committee preferred to resume the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill— Jacob Thompson of Mississippi resumed the debate on Owsley’s motion to strike out the item of 1500 dollars for a secretary to the President to sign Patents. the amendments was rejected— Boardman Chairman of the Committee of public buildings moved sundry amendments some of which were adopted, and others rejected— Wilis Green moved to strike out the items for the branch mints at Charlotte, North-Carolina, Dahlonega, Georgia, and New-Orleans, Louisiana; Green withdrew his motion, but it was renewed by Garret Davis, and started a fiery debate—in which Green W. Caldwell and Graham of North Carolina—Moore of Louisiana, Black and Habersham of Georgia battled for the mints— Everett slily for and against them, till T. W. Gilmer took the floor—no quorum— Committee rose and the house adjourned— I finished my draught of the bill for the Smithsonian bequest Committee, and added five new Sections for their consideration. Lord Ashburton arrived this day. "

White— The resolution of enquiry whether Cornelius P. Van Ness has received as heretofore Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain more money than he was lawfully entitled to, from the Treasury, was taken up and largely discussed— His recent Letter to me, as chairman of the Committee was at last read but no question upon it was taken and the Committee adjourned over to Thursday Morning— In the house I notified all the members of the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest, excepting Mr Bowne who is absent, to attend a meeting to-morrow morning, and I gave to Mr Underwood to read the five additional sections to read and which complete my plan for the establishment of the institution, and the provision of a fund for the erection and perpetual support of an astronomical observatory, upon a scale equal to that of any one upon earth. He doubted the expediency of including them in the present bill, for fear of alarming the house; but cordially approved of my whole plan— On entering the house I found Edward J. Black of Georgia, driving furiously according to his usual custom, for leave to introduce a resolution for the appointment of a special Committee to enquire into the expediency of authorizing the Governor of Georgia to call out the militia of the State to be paid at once ad libitum, from the Treasury of the United States, to protect the people of Georgia, bordering on Florida, from the Indians, and from the troops of the United States.— Black kept the house a full half hour in a stew, pushing for a suspension of the rules to enable him to offer this resolution— Joseph R. Ingersoll all the time urging a motion to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, which at last prevailed without quieting Black. Richard W. Thompson of Indiana was Chairman and the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill was resumed— Gilmer made a short dull speech for abolishing the branch mints, to which Habersham replied The motion to strike out the item was rejected. Medill of Ohio moved to strike out the item for the salary of Doty, Governor of the Territory of Wiskonsin, and produced handbills containing resolutions of whig meetings, and journals of legislative councils charging doty with numerous malversations.— I opposed this motion, and brought up C. J. Ingersoll for the sole purpose of bating me. I disdained to reply to him.— Everett did, taking care also to dissent from me— But the motion of Medill obtained not more than thirty votes— The Committee rose soon after 3 for lack of a quorum, and the house adjourned against my earnest protestation.— After dinner, with my wife, I visited an English miniature painter named Saunders nearly opposite our house— Mr R. Cutts was here this Evening, and Mr G. W Lay, with Erastus Brooks— "

                "text": "6. V. Wednesday.  Committee on the Smithsonian bequest— Present, Adams, Underwood, Truman Smith, Benjamin Randall, and C. J Ingersoll—absent Habersham, Houston, Bowne and Hunter— I was authorised to present to the house the draught of the Bill which I had prepared together with the five additional Sections, with one other, to dispose of the surplus income, from the principal fund, beyond the 30000 dollars a year, for ten years from the 1st. of September 1838. appropriated by the Bill; and with the Bill a report. In the house I found Black of Georgia driving again for a suspension of the rules to enable him to offer a resolution for a select Committee to enquire into the expediency of making an appropriation for the governor of Georgia, to call out and employ the militia of the State for the protection of the border people of Georgia, against the Florida Indians, and the United States troops— Black’s proposal was so revolting that it was clear he could not obtain a suspension of the rules; whereupon his colleague Lott Warren, a whig, a popular, and liberal, but shrewd man, moved and carried by yeas and nays a suspension of the rules to offer a resolution substantially the same, but divided into two parts, setting in front a call of enquiry upon the Secretary of War; and lurking behind it a reference to the Military Committee, of the proposal to appropriate money for the Governor of Georgia to call out the militia.— I voted for the suspension of the rules, but when the resolution was received, I exposed Warren’s ingenuity and moved to strike out the second half of his Resolution which was like the two bulbs of a gooses’s gizzard— My motion was carried by yeas and naystoand the call of enquiry upon the Secretary of War passed without opposition. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Richard W. Thompson of Indiana in the Chair. At Wise’s motion a Senate Bill, appropriating 250000 dollars for the building and equipment of an iron war steamer, was first taken up and without opposition or proposal of amendment laid aside to be reported to the house, and then the general appropriation bill was resumed and some progress in it made— Cross of Arkansas moved a proviso, that 500 dollars should be withheld from the salary of every judge of the Supreme Court for every failure to attend at any term of a circuit court within his district— This started a debate of nearly two hours, in which Cross and Thompson of Mississippi vehemently denounc judge M’Kinley for total neglect to attend for several years past, the circuit courts in the States of Mississippi and of Arkansas— The judge was earnestly defended by Gwin the other member from Mississippi, and Roosevelt, Pope, Samson Mason, Barnard and myself took part in the debate— Cross finally withdrew his motion— Not long after, Thompson moved an addition of 200 dollars to the Salary of the Marshal in Mississippi, and on taking the question there was found no quorum voting— It was just two O’Clock— The Committee rose, and reported the fact to the house. Landaff W. Andrews of Kentucky, an honest, prejudiced hot headed man, who always moves by impulses, and whose wild stare always denotes excitement moved a call of the house, and declared that he would carry it through; and he did carry it through— Two hours and a half were consumed in the operation— One hundred and two members were reported absent after the first and second call of the names, the closing of the doors, and the call for excuses.— 28 were brought in ostensibly in the custody of the Serjeant at Arms.— Called to account for their absence, and admitted to their seats on payment of the marshal’s fees—most of the excuses were that they had gone home to dinner. 24 were excused, without payment of fees, almost all pleading indisposition— Mr Barnard moved and urged a suspension of all further proceedings, before the call of the members to account—and he made some just observations on the harshness of the whole proceeding; which I admitted, and said if he would move to relinquish all compulsive measures upon calls of the house I might vote with him.— But as this was the first instance in ten years since I have had a seat in the house, of a compulsive call at noonday, and as it had been made necessary by several successive days when Committees of the whole have been broken up and the house obliged to adjourn for want of a quorum, I hoped the process would be carried through—the names of the delinquent members would be published in the newspapers to-morrow, and I hoped would at least secure a quorum for the future at least through the middle of the day for the transaction of business— Andrews finally moved a resolution that all absentees who had not answered should be fined the amount of the Serjeant at arms’s fees—subject to the release of their fine on appearing hereafter and giving satisfactory reasons for their absence.— It was about 5. when the house adjourned.— Evening visits from Mr Uzielli—Dr Barstow, Mr Dorr and Dr John Gorham Palfrey.— Uzielli has travelled through a great part of this Union, and proposes to pass through the remainder, to return to Europe next July— Dr Barstow, Mr Dorr, and Dr Gorham Palfrey I suppose are all expectants.

Mr Sprague called on me this morning, and left with me a copy of a memorial to Congress from manufacturers of cordage in Massachusetts concerning the duties on hemp and cordage, with a statement of the price of Russian hemp and cordage, and of Manilla hemp— He gave me his views upon the proposed duties on these two articles in the tariff bill recently reported by Mr Saltonstall, chairman of the Committee of manufactures— He also spoke of the omission of the joint Committee in the Massachusetts Legislature to report upon the resolution instructing them to enquire into the outrage upon me, in my recent trial here—he was a member of that Committee, and said that their reason for not reporting was that after the whole subject had been laid on the table here, they thought no expression of opinion there was necessary for my personal support, and that a strong resolution might produce excitement and alienation at the South, which it would be prudent to avoid— But that the approbation of my conduct was universal, and it was in contemplation to nominate me for the Office of Governor of the Commonwealth for the next year— I said that having nine years ago consented sorely against my own inclination to have my name presented as a candidate for the Office of Governor of Massachusetts, and a majority of the people having decided against me, I had no reason to expect they would be more favourable to me now; and should not suffer their suffrages to be asked for me again— Sprague told me that Saltonstall said to him that he did not recollect having written to Massachusetts that if the Massachusetts Legislature should pass a Resolution countenancing me, the Massachusetts claim here would suffer for it— Mr Preston having charge of it in the Committee of the Senate; and that care should be taken not to offend him— Sprague kept me at home, till it was half past ten, before I reached the Committee of foreign Affairs— I found Everett, Shepperd, Stuart and Caruthers waiting for me to make a quorum absent Granger, Cushing, White and Meriwether— I was directed to report the Senate Bill for the relief of the legal representatives of Aaron Vail without amendment.

                "text": "8. VI. Thursday  An old man by the name of Gilpin, from a neighbouring County of Maryland, a family connection of the Johnson family, called on me this morning and said he was 78 years of age, and was fast going to another world, and he came to take leave of me, as it was probably the last time he should ever see me in this. He talked politics after the manner of a county farmer, and without entering into details said that he approved of my course in congress.— I went to the Treasury Department, with 500 dollars of Treasury notes issued on the 3d. of April 1841. and payable after one year from the date, for which I received instead of payment a certificate from a clerk in the 1st. Auditors Office, that I have left that amount of Treasury Notes for reimbursement— I then went to the Department of State, where I was first told that the Senators from Massachusetts and Maine were in conference with the Secretary. I went into the chamber of the chief clerk—Fletcher Webster, and was soon after admitted to the Secretary himself.— I told him that the Committee of foreign affairs wished something more explicit and specific, with regard to the expediency of discontinuing or reducing the rank of sundry particular missions abroad, than was contained in his last Letter to me— I said there was also some question in the Committee upon the principle assumed in his Letter, that it was to be presumed, that all estimates of appropriations proposed by the heads of Departments, were upon deliberation of the Executive deemed necessary.— That it was supposed the practice had been to make up the estimates of each year from the Appropriations of the preceding year, without special investigation of the items which might be curtailed— And I referred him to the case of the Missions to Sweden and Holland, reduced in 1818. by the paring down of the appropriations, presented by the estimates of the department. And I found among the books of the department my Letter to Jonathan Russell of 22. May 1818. announcing the extinction of his mission, and his answer of 26. September 1818. Mr Webster finally told me that between this time and next Monday morning he would write me another Letter on the subject. This conference detained me so that it was within a quarter of 12. O’Clock when I reached the house.— I found Milton Brown of Tennessee addressing the house on a privileged question concerning himself.— In the debate on Summers’s retrenchment Resolutions, Milton Brown had made a severe speech on the abuse practiced by some of the members of Congress in appropriating to themselves excessive quantities of stationery—whereupon Charles Brown the Philadelphia demagogue told a story of an enormous mass of stationery having been left one day during the extra-session at his lodgings, which he had not ordered, and knew not whence it came; but the next day the Post-Office messenger came and took it, and said it had been left there by mistake, but was for Mr Milton Brown of Tennessee— This sneaking and spiteful innuendo, Milton Brown had passed over without notice at the time—and it had not been noticed in the next days reported debates either in the intelligencer or the globe. But Charles had afterwards published his speech with all its dirty imputations in the globe which Milton Brown had not seen nor heard of till he received a few days since a Letter from one of his friends and constituents informing that this story was circulating all over his district, and was raising such an outcry against him, that it was indispensable that he should encounter and repel the charge— He therefore produced a certificate from M’Cormick the Postmaster that the Stationery furnished him at the extra Session, had been unusually small, and from the messenger who had left by mistake at Charles Brown’s lodgings, the parcel, which had swollen so enormously in his narrative, consisted only of half a ream of Letter paper, without wafers sealing wax, or any other article— Milton Brown after thus disculpating himself from the charge emitted some sparks of indignation upon the Slander, which Charles Brown very ungraciously retracted— The question upon the passage of the iron war steamer bill had been taken by yeas and nays, and carried by 129. to 31. before I came into the house— The general appropriation bill then followed, and Mark A Cooper moved to strike out the item of 100000 dollars for the survey of the coast—this raised something of a debate but the survey was now vigorously maintained, and even Cushing had discovered its utility and importance.— There was a blow-up between Kennedy of Indiana, and Holmes of South-Carolina, about a service of plate given by the corporation of the City of New-York to Lieutenant Gedney of the U. S. Navy, and another between Proffit and Fressenden of Maine about the item of appropriation for the survey of the North-eastern boundary.— Past 4 the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— Mr Dorr called on me this Evening, and requesting two minutes of conversation with me kept me a full hour in discussing a project, which he had shaped into an act of Congress, to authorise the President to institute an Office half diplomatic, half consular, for him to go to Buenos-Ayres— Evening at Dr John M. Thomas’s. "

Brown, who called upon me last Evening told me that he was and had been from the beginning President of the suffrage party in Rhode-Island.— The political right of suffrage by the charter of Charles the second, which they have hitherto retained as a State constitution, is confined almost entirely to free holders.— Last autumn by an irregular popular movement a Convention of delegates from self constituted meetings formed and published a State Constitution, upon the principle of universal suffrage. The legislature then authorized by Law, another Convention to prepare a Constitution, enlarging the right of suffrage, but not making it universal. It was recently submitted to the people in town meetings, and rejected, and now, Brown says the elections under the suffrage party’s constitution are to be held next Monday week, after which they will assume the government of the State— The existing Legislature however have enacted a law prohibiting all further progress of this movement on severe penalties, and the Governor has issued a proclamation against it— He has sent three Commissioners to claim the military interference of the national Government against internal commotion, and Brown told me he had come to counteract them, and was going to see the President.— General Scott, whom I met last evening at Dr Thomas’s, and who is a regularly nominated and acquiescent Candidate for election as President of the U.S. justly think that the times are distempered— This morning I attended the Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Present Adams, Stuart, White, Granger, Caruthers and Everett— Absent, Cushing, Shepperd and Meriwether I reported the substance of my conference yesterday with the Secretary of State; and his promise to write to me again— The Committee agreed therefore to meet again on Monday morning.— Certain Resolutions of the Legislature bearing a hostile aspect towards Mexico, were barely taken up and postponed.— In the House, Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Thompson of Indiana in the Chair, on the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— The Committee of Ways and Means, proposed for the Custom house at Boston 50,000 dollars— The Secretary’s estimate had proposed 150000. Winthrop had moved to add the 100000 last evening, and now there was sharp debate closed by the rejection of that motion—then of another motion to raise the item to 75000—then of a motion to strike out the item of 50000 proposed by the Committee— Black of Georgia moved as an amendment 30000 dollars for a Custom-house at Savannah—and I moved as an amendment to his amendment, the same sum for a custom-house at Plymouth—both rejected. Committee rose and house adjourned at 4. My wife went to her sister Hellen’s— She lies dangerously ill. "

                "text": "10. IV:30. Sunday.  I attended with my wife, Elizabeth C. Adams, and Mary Cutts public worship at the Capitol, where Mr Maffitt preached his fourth Sermon upon the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ. His text was from Matthew 15.22. [“]And, behold, a woman of Canaan, came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him saying, Have mercy on me O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 23. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, send her away; for she crieth after us. 24. But he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 25. Then came she and worshipped him; saying Lord, help me. 26. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs. 27. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master’s table. 28. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee, even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.” This discourse was more rhapsodical than any one that I had heard from Mr Maffitt before.— The text bore only a very remote connection with the text— The miraculous healing of the sick is evidence of a divine mission, but not of the divinity of the performer.— He sometimes betrays gross and ludicrous ignorance such as saying that diamonds and pearls are found in the bosom of the earth. He said that the only way in which God could sympathise with man was by making himself a man—and then told a story of his once witnessing in New-Hampshire the death of an infant, and the bitter and as he thought culpably excessive lamentations of its parents, and his having within a fortnight after, lost a child of his own, and given himself up to lamentations more excessive than those that he had censured in others— He gave out to be sung one hymn, and set the tune, and sung another alone, and announced that he should preach again next Sunday morning— I walked home— Met Stanly and John P. Kennedy, who told me the Clay dinner went off very well yesterday, that my Letter of excuse was read, and Saltonstall made a handsome Speech— After dinner I went with my wife to St. John’s Church where Mr Hawley read prayers for the second Sunday after Easter, and preached from Isaiah 57.15. [“]For thus saith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy. I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and a humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.” "

Richard Cutts spent part of the Evening here— This morning I attended the Committee of foreign affairs. Present Adams, Everett, White, Shepperd, Stuart and Caruthers—absent Granger, Cushing and Meriwether— The promised communication from the Secretary of State was not then received— The Committee referred the claims of John A. Smith, Mrs Slade and Edwin Bartlett to Mr Stuart.— In the house after a short interval of preliminary matter, the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Thompson of Indiana in the chair— Mr Proffit resumed his speech upon the light-house establishment of the United Sates by a general attack upon the whole system— He compared it with the corresponding establishments of Great-Britain and France, and charged it with being far more expensive— He censured Pleasonton the 5th. Auditor, as altogether incompetent for the superintendence of so vast and complicated an establishment, and found fault especially with Mr Winslow Lewis, who for many years appears to have been the contractor general for building and supplying all the lighthouses.— Proffit complained that there was an undue proportion of light-houses on the Northern, where there are multitudes of harbours, and a very small number on the Southern coast, where there are scarcely any harbours at all— He displayed a number of maps on which the places of light-houses were marked with red spots, and he affirmed that at some of the lighthouses, th consumption of oil was exnormous, owing to the fact that the keepers of the lights sold the oil to the supply of the neighbourhood five miles round. After rattling away for two hours in this style Proffit said he should hereafter make a similar view of the whole customhouse system and prove it equally rotten and corrupt, and then withdrew his motion to strike out the appropriation—but it was immediately renewed by Sprigg of Kentucky, a man as eccentric, prejudiced and hot-headed as Proffit, with not a tythe of his talents—his principal eloquence consists of pounding his table with his fist— Fillmore was very anxious to get the Bill through the Committee and the house, and T. W. Williams J. P. Kennedy, Winthrop, and Cushing defended the light-house establisment. Pleasonton the 5th. auditor and Winslow Lewis— Wise charged Proffit with putting out the eyes of the Ocean, and said that some of the greatest scoundrels on the earth were wreckers some of whom were his constituents— Rodney took the floor—the Committee rose and the house adjourned— In the evening I went over to Mr T. B. Johnson, and paid him in gold and silver 395.75 in part for his draft of 530. on my son at Boston. "

My Catarrhal cough has returned upon me with great severity, and has been troublesome the last two Nights.— I declined invitations to the birthright and take leave Clay ball this evening and from the Russian Minister Bodisco, and his Lady to dinner to-morrow.— But Mr Bodisco came to my seat yesterday and urged me so earnestly to come to his dinner, which he said was a compliment to Lord Ashburton, that I promised him I would come, if I should find myself sufficiently relieved from the rack of my cough to be able— Mr Simmons one of the Senators from Rhode-Island came to my seat and said it was reported that Dutee J. Pearce was in this City and had called on me, and enquired if it was true— I told him that I had not seen Mr Pearce, and did not know whether he was or had been in the city or not. Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs at 10. All the members present except Mr Meriwether who is gone to Georgia— The second Letter from Mr Webster to me was read, with a statement respecting the missions to Venezuela, New-Grenada, Chile and Peru— There were voluminous documents respecting our relations with Sardinia, Naples, and Turkey. Mr Everett moved that a proviso should be proposed to be added to the diplomatic appropriations, that if any of the ministers abroad should be recalled in the course of the year, the remnant of his salary for the year might be applied to the quarter for return.— In the house Shields of Alabama made a pass to crowd in a series of Resolutions looking to the defence of the South, and by dint of pushing and perseverance carried two or three of them. Reports from Committees were called— I reported from the Committee of foreign Affairs the Senate Bill 64. for the relief of the legal representatives of Aaron Vail, deceased, heretofore Consul at L’Orient; without amendment— Proffit called for some explanation of the bill, and it passed without opposition— I presented also a report adverse to the claim of Abigail Dumas, which at my motion was laid on the table— When the select Committees were called I asked leave to report from the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest a Bill; but the bill itself was at my house. C. J. Ingersoll had presented to the house, and referred to the Committee a claim of Richard Rush for extra services in recovering the money, and the Speaker said he had additional documents to presents relating to that claim— I moved that the Committee should be discharged from the further consideration of the claim and that it be referred to the Committee of claims—which with faint opposition from C. J. Ingersoll was carried. In Committee of the whole on the Union the diplomatic appropriations came up. the Committee rose and the house adjourned. Conversation with James Whitcomb. "

Van Ness some time Minister of the United States in Spain called on me this morning and had a long conversation with me concerning the subject of his accounts and of the allowances made to him upon the settlement of them— He complains much of the bitter personal hostility to him of the late Secretary of State John Forsyth—and of Aaron Vail, under Forsyth chief Clerk of that Department, and afterwards Chargé d’Affaires in Spain. I told him that his last Letter to me had been read in the Committee of foreign Affairs, and that the Committee were now engaged in the examination of his claims to allowances; and the action of the Department of State upon them. Mr Van Ness’s visit detained me so that I had barely time to call at the Bank of the Metropolis, where they refused to take 21. old French crowns in deposit, and where with extreme reluctance they gave me twenty half eagles for a check upon the deposit of a Speaker’s draft of February 1842.— In the house John P. Kennedy made a vigorous exertion to obtain a suspension of the rules for a resolution authorising the Secretary of War to lend a parcel of tents for an encampment of militiamen next month in the vicinity of Baltimore; but he could not succeed— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Thompson of Indiana in the Chair upon the Civil and diplomatic appropriation bill—the appropriations for missions abroad being under consideration— I sent to the Clerk’s table, my first Letter as Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of State and his answer which were read, and I stated the purport of his subsequent second Letter and other communications to the committee— Archibald A. Linn of New-York, moved to reduce the item for a Minister to Mexico, from provision for a Minister Plenipotentiary, to that of a chargé d’Affaires— His objections were to the person of the minister recently appointed, Waddy Thompson junr. and to the mission itself on the suspicion that its object was the annexation of Texas to the United States Linn had the minutes for a long and elaborate speech but gave only a short synopsis of it— But the game was started— Pickens, Reynolds, Fillmore, Cushing, Jones of Maryland, Slade and Wise followed— William Butler of South Carolina took the floor—the Committee rose, and the house adjourned. I dined at the Russian Minister Bodisco’s—with Lord Ashburton, Messrs Barrow, Benton, Bruce, John C. Calhoun, Clay, Crittenden, Evans, Fox, Hudson, Hulseman, King of Alabama, Legare, Lisboa, Martini, Mildmay, Preston, Rives, Scott, Seaton, Serruys, Speeding, Upshur, Webster, Fletcher Webster, White, (Speaker) Wickliff, Wright, and perhaps one or two others. It was a dinner to Lord Ashburton. "

Meeting of the Committee of foreign affairs, at half past 9 this morning.— All the members present except Mr Meriwether; Mr Stuart however being otherwise engaged merely came in for a moment and retired— Mr Cushing read a long report, upon the petition of Jabez Mowry andothers inhabitants of Lubeck in the State of Maine, complaining of the condition of our trade with the British American Colonies— Appended to the report were sundry resolutions, and Mr Cushing presented the alternative of a Bill— After some discussion, the Committee authorised Cushing to prevent the report to the house, with one set of his resolutions— He asked me, if I was willing to move the printing of an extra number of copies of the report which I readily promised to do. And he enquired, if I would consent to his annexing in the appendix to the report my article in the 3d. number of the American Quarterly Review on the subject— I said I should have no objection to that— In the house Fillmore had yesterday moved the printing of 5000 more extra-copies of the two reports from the Committee of manufacture 5000 having already been printed and distributed— Lott Warren had objected, which laid over the motion for one day— This morning Fillmore renewed it and moved the previous question.— Warren renewed his objection but the Speaker said, that after the previous question, it was too late, and the motion was carried— Fillmore moved a Resolution to take the general appropriation bill out of Committee of the whole on Saturday at Noon. I objected, saying that after Wise’s speech of yesterday, I held it indispensible to occupy the floor a considerable time, and I was unwilling to abridge the time of others who might wish to reply to me— Llandaff W. Andrews a Nimrod Wildfire from Kentucky, moved as an amendment to Fillmore’s motion, that the Bill should be taken out of Committee this day at 4 O’Clock but the motion of Andrews was rejected, and that of Fillmore carried by yeas and nays 100 to 73.— I voted against it— The Loan Bill, returned from the Senate with an amendment was then taken up by suspension of the rules 111 to 38. Cifford moved a sneaking amendment to the Senate’s Amendment, and called the yeas and nays— Fillmore moved the previous question which was carried— Clifford’s amendment was rejected 88 to 101. and the amendment of the Senate was adopted without a division— Cushing presented his report on the colonial trade with a resolution requesting the President to negotiate— I moved the printing of 10000 extra copies, but objection was made and the case lies over for a week— Committee of the whole on the Union— General Appropriation bill.— Charles J. Ingersoll in a speech of an hour and a half, started new game. I answered him partly till at 4. the Committee rose and the house adjourned. "

Ingersoll’s speech yesterday in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon a motion to strike out and reduce the appropriation for Ministers to Vienna and Berlin by razeeing them down to the rank of Chargé d’Afffaires, was a Congreve rocket thrown into the house to kindle a blazing War spirit and push a stumbling block in the way of the negotiation with Great Britain— Profligate as were his leading principles, and glaring with absurdity as were his leading arguments and perverted and distorted as were his leading facts, such was the impression of his speech upon the house, that when he sat down, every eye in the house was fastened on me, as if in a voice of thunder to call upon me to meet him. I was almost prostrated by the loudness and suddenness of the silent call— I paused for a moment to give every other member the chance for the floor—no one rose— I did, under a sense of depression from which I could not wholly recover. My discourse was rambling and desultory— The result of my speech was apparently satisfactory to my friends; but by no means to myself— Morgan invited me to dine with him at his lodgings at Hyatt’s; which I accordingly did— It was a parting dinner to Mr Clay: his friends Crittenden and Saltonstall were there and the fellow boarders—Rencher and his wife—Halsted and his wife—Mrs Morgan—Taliaferro, and two or three others— The agitation and exertion of a long extemporaneous speech, followed by a convivial dinner aggravated my catarrhal cough, and I had a disturbed, restless and uncomfortable night. Yet I was to resume my speech not half finished this morning, and although Ingersoll’s speech of yesterday, and mine were reported of in the National Intelligencer of this morning, and Wise’s of the day before, I had yet not time to read them before the House was in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union with the general Appropriation bill under consideration, and I had the floor to continue and conclude my speech— I had found yesterday in the Congress Library the volume of Niles’s register, the Correspondence between General Jackson and Governor Rabun of Georgia, and in the Independent Newspaper of this morning there is a Letter from a correspondent at Paris, relating the proceedings in the French chamber of deputies on the address to the king when the amendment passed for preventing the ratification by France of the Quintuple Slave-trade Treaty—both these documents I used in the speech of three hours with which I concluded my reply to Ingersoll and Wise— The instant I finished Llandaff W. Andrews ready to burst with rage, moved to reconsider the resolution to take the bill out of Committee at Noon to morrow; but Campbell of South Carolina spoke about an hour and a half against me— Botts then took the floor—the Committee rose and the house adjourned— My speech of this day stung the Slavocracy to madness.

These two persons are from New-York— Contractors—the former for iron-work—the latter for painting in the new Custom-house at that city— They say that their work has been performed—their contracts on their part executed—but that the item for the Custom-house at New-York, without which they cannot be paid has been stricken out from the general appropriation bill, and that they have debts heavily pressing upon them which they cannot pay unless they are themselves paid; and intreating my influence to get the item restored into the Bill— It would be a desperate chance to attempt to restore it in this bill; and will be a desperate chance for me to attempt it at all—but I said I would do what I could. At half past 9. I attended the Committee room of the foreign Affairs; but it was ten before a Quorum of the Committee appeared— The members present at last, were Adams, Caruthers, Everett, Stuart, Granger and White— Absent, Cushing, Shepperd and Meriwether. The papers relating to the claim of Cornelius P. Van Ness were taken up and the two Letters of 1 and 31. March 1841 published in the National Intelligencer were read. Mr Van Ness’s second answer to them in part—but before the reading of it was finished the house bell rang and the Committee adjourned to next Tuesday morning— In the house, Underwood carried a Resolution for reprinting an old pamphlet of James Rumsey, published in 1787. It is to prove that Rumsey was long before Fulton, the inventor of Steam-navigation— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Thompson of Indiana, in the Chair— Civil and diplomatic appropriation bill.— Llandaff W. Andrews persisted in his motion to reconsider the vote for taking the bill out of Committee But a majority of the house were determined not to reconsider.— Botts occupied the time in attempting to reply to me, in a very disingenuous manner, violent and feeble— About 3 minutes before 12. he moved the Committee to rise which was carried and the question upon Andrews’s motion to reconsider was lost by yeas and nays 89. to 95— I voted for the reconsideration, as I had voted against the limitation of the time, when Andrew’s had moved and voted, not to wait till this day, but to take the bill out of Committee at 4. O’Clock on Thursday, the very day on which Fillmores motion to limit the time was made. The motion to reconsider being lost a multitude of questions on proposed amendments were taken. the bill was reported to the house— Yeas and nays were taken on sundry amendments, under the previous question between 3 and 4 the Committee rose and the house adjourned. In the Evening I left cards at Lord Ashburton’s and Mr Websters, and called for an hour on Mr T. B. Johnson’s, and for another at Mr B. Ogle Tayloe’s. "

Chill North-east storm— I went alone this morning to the Capitol expecting to hear Mr Maffitt— Instead of which Mr Tustin announced that by an arrangement with Mr Maffitt’s consent, the services would be performed by the Revd. Mr Perkins a missionary to Persia, and by Mar Yohanan a venerable Bishop of the Nestorians— The Revd. Mr Perkins read the 72d. Psalm— He made a prayer from one sentence of which I perceived that a member of the house was deceased— I was aware that it was Joseph Lawrence of Washington County Pennsylvania—he had died of a congestive fever not half an hour before. Mr Perkins’s text was from Acts 14.27. And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. Mr Perkins presented a summary of the mission of Paul and Barnabas to the Gentiles, and of their adventures at Antioch, where the disciples of Jesus first received the name of Christians; and he held forth the analogy between this part of the apostolic history, and that of his own mission to the Nestorians in Persia. Of this he gave a very interesting account— The Nestorians are a very ancient, small sect of Christians, living under Mahometan dominationn in the heart of Persia— Of their peculiar tenets he gave no distinct exhibition, but he gave them full and grateful testimony to the kindness with which they had received and treated the missionaries. He spoke also thankfully of the good office, and friendly assistance received from the British consuls and official agents in Persia— The old bishop Mar Yohanan, made himself a short address, in very intelligible English, and concluded by pronouncing the benediction in his own language.— After dinner, at St. John’s church the evening service was performed by Mr Chauncy, son of the late Commodore, and he preached from John 16.32.— “I am not alone, because the father is with me.” Confidence in the upholding and sustaining arm of God in all trouble and affliction was the doctrine, urged with warm sensibility and persuasive argument by this talented young man. I had called yesterday at the National Intelligencer Office, and asked Mr Gales to send me the slips of my speech of yesterday to be published to morrow, for my revisal— He sent them this evening—seven columns of small print, reported by Stansbury.— I employed two hours in revising them, and found very few and slight corrections to make.— This speech was made under deep and solemn conviction of duty— Its issues are with the father of Spirits— I must abide by its consequences— May they be auspicious to the Peace of my Country, and to human freedom— "

Borland the Carpenter was here this morning, and I settled with him, an old bill— He asked me whether the appropriation bill would soon pass— I told him it would pass the house on Wednesday, and I supposed the Senate a few days later. He said he had no claim of his own—but he had debts due to him from persons whose means of payment consisted in the debts of the Treasury to them. How this complaint like that of Tibbits and Hodgkin exemplifies the extent of injustice and wrong, which infects every vein and artery of the community, by the insolvency of the Treasury. Mr Peddrick the sculptor came and invited me to visit his studio again— He said he had some new works, executed since I was there—particularly one of disappointed love. And he spoke of the bas-reliefs he was preparing for the pedestal of Greenough’s Statue of Washington— George Cameron an intelligent old Scotchman came and took back the papers he had last left with me concerning his invention for preventing the bursting of Steam-engine boilers. He says he exhibited the same papers to me, and explained them to my entire satisfaction, when I was President— He affirms that by his invention one sixth of the pressure of steam now used will produce the same impetus of propulsion—but he is yet none the richer for his ingenuity.— At the house, before the prayer James Irvin of Milesburg, Pennsylvania, came to my Seat, and enquired, if I would consent to have my name placed on the list of the Committee of Arrangements for the funeral of Mr Lawrence, to which I cheerfully assented— Immediately after the reading of the journal William W. Irwin of Pittsburg announced the decease of his colleague, Joseph Lawrence pronounced a suitable Eulogy upon his character, and moved the usual resolutions, which were adopted without further observation and the house adjourned.— Mr Burch came to me and said that Mr Irvin had insisted that my name should be set down as Chairman of the Committee of arrangements. Against this I remonstrated; the chairman being always at these funerals a member from the State represented by the deceased.— But Burch said they would take it to heart if I refused, and I acquiesced.— After the adjournment I came home as soon as I could— This evening, Mr Foster, an Armourer from the arsenal at Springfield and Mr Wilcox , a citizen of that town, came to me, with a grievous complaint of an innovation in the superintendence of that establishment changing it from a civil to a military organization— They represented that the change was equally dissatisfactory to the workmen and to the citizens— This is the subject upon which I have the counter report of Major Ripley, on the other side— It is to come before Congress, I do not exactly how but I promised to give my attention to it— Evening of preparations for the party.

The hackman took me home, where my writing table and papers were transferred to the northern upper chamber.— Mr Leavitt, who lodges at Spriggs had given me this morning, his notes of my speech of last Thursday to be published in the Emancipator— It is the report in the National Intelligencer partially revised— I revised them myself this afternoon, and returned them to him when he called for them this Evening and he engaged to have the whole speech on both days, published in a pamphlet from the columns of the Emancipator. We had this evening a party of about one hundred persons given by my wife as a parting compliment to Mr Henry Clay—and composed entirely of his friends, with the addition of the foreign ministers—and their official families— The french minister Bacourt was not invited; as he had taken offence at some remarks made in public by me, with regard to the title of Louis-Philippe— Lord Ashburton with Messrs Speeding, Mildmay and Bruce was here; but Mr Fox and Mr Hudson neither came, nor answered their notes of invitation— Our party was pleasant, and the dancing was kept up till near midnight.

Mr William Brent called this morning to enquire what had been done, concerning his memorial claiming compensation for the services of his deceased brother Daniel, in the interval between the return of Edward Livingston home, and the arrival of Lewis Cass as his successor; a space of nearly or quite two years. I promised Mr Brent to give all due attention to the claim which I believe to be just— I called at the Treasury Department with the Treasury Notes which they had sent me instead of payment of 500 dollars issued on the 3d. of April 1841. with the 30 dollars interest upon them—and they had dated the new Notes the 8th. of this present April— I was told that not having delivered up the former Notes till the 8th. the warrant had been dated on that day—and that I had forfeited the intervening interest by my own lashes—which I said might have been alledged, if they had been prepared to pay me, when I did come for payment— They referred me to the Secretary, who immediately acknowledged the obligation to correct the date; but there was some difficulty from the cumbersome machinery of the public accounts, and Mr Young the chief-clerk said it would be necessary to state over again the whole account. I left the new notes with Mr Forward, and was detained by this business so as to be a half an hour belated at the house— I found them taking questions, on the amendments adopted in Committee of the whole to the appropriation Bill— Clifford of Maine raised a point of order, which the Speaker overruled— Clifford appealed.— Fillmore moved to lay the appeal on the table, which was carried by yeas and nays 86 to 75.— After which the vote on the amendment to strike out all the contingencies was carried 105 to 68— The vote in Committee of the whole upon Charles J. Ingersoll’s motion to reduce the item for the expenditures of all the judicial Courts from 475000 to 375000 dollars was confirmed by yeas and nays 106 to 75. A proviso limiting the emoluments of the district Attorney, and clerk of the district and circuit Courts of the Northern district of New-York was also carried 118 to 51. and another that no part of the appropriation should be applied to pay the expence of printing records for the judges of the Supreme Court except in cases to which the United States are parties.— sundry other amendments were adopted and some rejected and some were adopted; and finally the bill was passed to be engrossed and passed without a division— Joseph R. Ingersoll from the Committee of Ways and Means then reported a General Bill for all the striken out contingencies—twice read and committed— The apportionment bill was taken up and postponed.

Hall a Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts took their acknowledgment of their Deed of conveyance to me of their portions of the Norton Quincy woodlot in Braintree, finally divided between the descendents of his heirs as tenants in common— At the House, immediately after the reading of the Journal, Horace Everett moved a Resolution to cease debate on the apportionment bill and take it out of Committee into the house next Monday at 12. O’Clock— This was outrageous— It would have nearly stifled all debate upon the bill— Llandaff W. Andrews, a man quite as summary, and much more fiery than Everett, moved to lay his resolution, on the table; which was carried by yeas and nays 92 to 74. John P. Kennedy presented a strong Tariff petition from Baltimore signed by 9094 names, praying for protection, countervailing and tonnage duties—brought by a committee of 28 gentlemen from Baltimore, and 56. yards long.— He moved its reference, partly to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union who have the tariff-bill before them, and partly to the Committee of Commerce.— He moved that it should be printed; but a petty debate arose between Kennedy and John T. Mason, as to the politics of the signers, and Everett moved that the names of the signers should be printed—when Turney moved to lay the motion to print on the table—carried 70 to 65.— Medill offered some Warspite Resolutions of a meeting in his district, but Morgan objected to their reception— Medill moved a suspension of the rules but carried only 61 votes for it.— John G. Floyd presented Resolutions of the Legislature of New-York for the repeal of the Land-distribution Bill—laid on the table and ordered to be printed— Proffit moved a long resolution of enquiry concerning iron-work on the New-York custom house; but on Briggs’s moving an amendment withdrew his resolution.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,Allen of Maine in the Chair.— The first question was on striking out 68000 and inserting 58000 which was rejected. then by general consent the question was taken on striking out 68000. carried—only about 30 members voting for it. Then 59. different numbers from 141000 down to 30000. were moved by 82 different members, beginning with 141000 moved by Underwood of Kentucky fortified by two speeches.— All these numbers were successively voted down by large majorities till they came to 60500, which was carried by tellers 82 to 60. one hundred members absent or not voting. I shall acquiesce in any number from 50 to 60,000. I voted against 60500. as too large— The Committee immediately after this vote rose, and the house adjourned.— I dined at Mr Webster’s— Lord Ashburton, with his Secretaries Mildmay, Bruce and Spedding were there. C. Cushing, G. Evans, F. Granger N. P. Talmadge, Reuel Williams, Mr and Mrs Webster, and Mr and Mrs Fletcher Webster—formed the company. Mrs Webster was very amiable. "

Friday  The regular presentation of Petitions, memorials and resolutions has been broken up, and annulled by the operation and consequences of the gag, or 21st. rule of the house— The rule stands on paper that for the first thirty days of each Session, the first order of every day on the Speaker’s taking the chair and the reading of the journal of the preceding day, shall be the presentation and reception of Petitions— Until the practice of refusing to receive abolition Petitions was started this process was a mere formality— All petitions were received—scarcely ever read, but referred to the Committees nominated by the presenting member, or laid silently on the table, and ordered if he desired it to be printed. The call for petitions never consumed more than the morning hour, and never occasioned debate. But from the time when the question of receiving petitions was raised, the objections to reception have so multiplied, as well as the number of Petitions, and the objects prayed for, and the chicanery against reception has become so tenacious, suspicious and fractious, that it has gone far to annihilate the right and the reception of Petitions altogether— The suspension of the rules almost every day of the first 30 substitutes other business instead of the reception of Petitions— After that, the receiving days are confined to once a fortnight— The call of the States takes two or three days to be gone through, and a member is not sure of a chance to present a petition of any kind once in six weeks.— They accumulate in my hands till I have hundreds in my draw, without knowing what to do with them. I have been compelled heretofore, and again at this Session to propose, that every member should be authorised to send his petitions to the Clerk’s table, and the Speaker should decide, which of them should be received, laid on the table, or referred to appropriate Committees.— Under this order which was adopted, P. G. Goode of Ohio, yesterday laid on the table, certain Resolutions of a popular meeting severely censuring the house for their censure of Giddings— The fact was stated on the journal, at which Botts flew into a Passion and moved to strike out that part of the journal; which after an abortive motion of Everett to lay it on the table, lost 74 to 93. was carried 98 to 75.— Everett then moved an additional Section to the Apportionment Bill, providing for a proportional representation of the fractions. The rest of the day was consumed in Committee of the whole to dispose of the undebatable private Bills to which the first and fourth Fridays are devoted by the rules of the house— The Committee was finally palsied by Wise who said we would oppose every bill that should be called up— They rose and he house adjourned over to Monday. In the Evening I went with my wife, Mrs John Adams Elizabeth, Mary-Louisa, and Walter Hellen, to Carusi’s Assembly rooms and saw the exhibition of Daguerre’s magical pictures— The same I had seen in Boston, last May.

Mr Franquinet a painter from French Flanders, recommended to me heretofore by judge Cranch, came this morning, and invited me to his chamber at Brown’s hotel, to look at a portrait of Henry Clay, which he has just finished— I did not at first recollect Mr Franquinet, who told me that his permanent residence now is at N. 12. Park Place New-York. Mr T. W. White Editor of the Southern Literary Messenger brought me a pamphlet parcel of the April number of that periodical, not yet published, but containing an Article on the right of search by Lieutenant Maury under the name of Harry Bluff.— Mr White breathed a prodigious puff to the honour of Lieutenant Maury, and requested me to read the Article between this and next Monday, and to give my opinion upon it in writing.— Dr Baldwin came and stated to me his distressed and forlorn condition, and implored my advice, what he should do. He said the Mexican joint-commission which had lately closed their sessions here had awarded to him a sum of 150000 dollars of indemnity, being only a small portion of his just claim; and even that the umpire baron Roenne had reduced. But of the award confirmed he could not obtain payment of a dollar— That he had just now returned from a journey to New-York and Boston, in both of which Cities he had made fruitless attempts to raise even so small a sum as five thousand dollars, at heavy interest upon the hypothecation of this award, and had been unable to raise so much as one thousand dollars— He had therefore returned here in utter destitution of the means of supporting himself and his family from week to week and from day to day— He had made attempts to see the President and Mr Webster without success, and he came to enquire if he could not obtain my influence to urge congress to do something to obtain Justice for him.— I advised him to write to the President, and to the Secretary of State, enquiring explicitly of them what they proposed to do, with regard to these liquidated claims; and if he could obtain no satisfactory answer from them, and wished to memorialize Congress if he desired it I would present his memorial, though I should advise him to apply to some more popular and influential member— He thanked me for the advice, and said he would follow it. At 12 O’Clock I went alone to the terrace behind the arsenal, and thence in a barge with many other members on board the Steamers Missouri Captain Newton and Mississippi Captain Salter lying at the anchor in mid-river. After a visit of two hours I returned, and at 6. went and dined with Lord Ashburton— The heads of Departments, Webster, Forward, Spencer, Upshur, Legare and Wickliffe, Foreign Ministers Bodisco and Martini, Speaker White and me— Senators Bates, Calhoun and Rives, General Scott, My lord and his three Aids formed the company.

                "text": "24. V:30 Sunday  The visit of the members of the house of Representatives to the two armed Steamers Missouri and Mississippi, yesterday, was by special invitation of the Secretary of the Navy— They were brought here for that particular purpose— They cost each of them over half a million of dollars; carry only ten Paixhan guns each, and are fit only for the defence of harbours— There was an attempt made in the house on Friday to get a vote that the house should go in a body, with the Speaker at their head; but it failed for want of gratuitous vehicles— There were about 100 members went on board yesterday.— The President came with all his Cabinet Ministers, and was received with a salute from the Paixhan guns— Hail Columbia from the Marine band, and the manning of the yards with a scanty exhibition of men.— Few of the members of Congress noticed at all the presence of the President. This sudden Virginian overflow of zeal for the patronage of the Navy comes reeking hot from the furnace of Slavery.— Tis a wholesome stream from a polluted fountain— This morning I went alone and heard Mr Tustin at the Capitol— His text was 2. Samuel 18.33. “And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom! my son, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom my son, my son!” From this somewhat singular text the preacher made up a brief discourse, not remarkably apposite to the edification or instruction of his auditory. Not like the Petit Carême of Massillon. The Congressional chaplains never think of their hearers; and indeed very few of the members ever attend to hear them. The history of Absalom’s rebellion is full of human nature in its nakedness, for instruction, warning and reproof. Mr Tustin’s improvement of his text was delicately to inform the members of Congress, that each and every one of us was an Absalom, in rebellion against the kingdom of our heavenly father— This is common-place calvinistic morality—without substantial meaning— At Saint John’s Church at half past 4 this afternoon, Mr Hawley read Evening prayers for the 4th. Sunday after Easter, and preached from Jeremiah 32.38. [“]And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 39. And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and their children after them: 40. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me 41. Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart, and with my whole soul.” The text was almost as long as the Sermon; and more weighty— I called at Mr T. B. Johnson’s, but he was riding out. Midshipman Joseph H. Adams, and Mary Cutts dined with us. Mrs John, and Elizabeth C. Adams spent the Evening at Mrs Ogle Tayloe’s. "

I called at the Bank of the Metropolis, and received the balance of my deposit there in specie— And after many months of unjustifiable delay, made up a packet of the manuscript of Samuel Elliot of Brattleborough, Vermont upon the Constitution, Laws, Politics and morals, delivered to me last Summer with a request that I would read it, and give my opinion of it in writing.— A request which I ought instantly to have denied, but which from the reluctance of my nature to say no, I did receive, without promising a written opinion, which I soon found that I ought not to give.— Mr Elliot has written to me twice, requesting me to return his manuscript, to him a jewel of inestimable value. I ought long since to have returned it. I put it with an apologetic Letter to Mr Elliot, this morning in the Post-Office of the House— This was the regular day of call to the States for Petitions. Pendleton of Ohio made a faint show of a wish to present his Resolutions from Cincinnati disapproving the censure of Giddings; but the house would not hear him. Everett proposed to take up and pass the private Bills reported from the Committee of the whole to the house last Friday— No. Cowen, Chairman of the Committee of Claims obtained leave for that Committee to sit during the sitting of the house for one week— Stanly called up a Bill reported from the Committee of Commerce, to prohibit the transportation of passengers or Letters from Port to Port of the United States by foreign ships or vessels— This is a new question started by the recent practice of the British West-India Mail Steamers ranging along our Coast, and stopping at all our Ports from Savannah to Boston.— This already brings them in collision with our Post-Office Laws and Stage running and Rail-road companies, and produced this bill.— It was on the point of being driven through without debate, till Proffit started a doubt, which soon kindled into a warm discussion— Cushing blew a flourish of trumpets about the colonial trade— Gordon of New-York butted his anglophobia upon the house at the same time that Proffit, Mark A. Cooper and Rhett in hatred of internal industry, blazed out for free trade, and the rights of the Citizen.— The bill was finally laid over till Thursday, and will be hotly contested— Underwood made an attempt to get up the District bank bill, suspended by a small amendment between the two houses, but in vain. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Elisha H. Allen in the chair, on the apportionment bill— Underwood moved to strike out 60500 as the common divisor, and insert 58500. Atherton 53999.— Briggs 50391. Atherton again 53875. Mark A. Cooper 56200. The Committee rose without coming to a vote and the house adjourned. Mr Powell, a Son of Cuthbert Powell a member of the house from Virginia was here, and Lyman Tenny of Quincy. "

Mr White, editor of the Southern literary Messenger called on me this morning, and took the Article of Lieutenant Maury, upon the right of Search, which he had lent me last Saturday, and requested me to read and give my opinion of it. He now asked my opinion, and I told him I disagreed with it altogether— That Lieutenant Maury’s Law, was Quarter deck Law—do no right; and take no wrong— That He assumed erroneous Law, and principles utterly untenable: and above all that the temper of his article was rancorous, and vituperative—a fault of all the diplomatic papers and dissertations on our side in this recent controversy— I desired him to ask Lieutenant Maury what he had to say to the 54th. 98th. and 99th. Sections of our collection Law of 1799.—and to the 7th. Section of the Act of 1807. for prohibiting the Slave-trade. At the house, Weller of Ohio, asked leave to offer Resolutions of a meeting in Ashtabula County censuring the conduct of Giddings— Stanly objected Weller moved a suspension of the rules; for which there were only 37. votes.— The Resolutions were not received— The effect of the gag-rule, against the reception of abolition petitions has familiarized the house to the refusal to receive petitions generally, that it operates upon all petitions and resolutions on all subjects, and it is now sufficient for any one member to object to the reception of any petition to ensure its exclusion.— Wood of New-York was equally unsuccessful in the effort to introduce a resolution of enquiry concerning expenditures at the Navy Yard Brooklyn— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Elisha H. Allen in the Chair on the Apportionment Bill— Mark A. Cooper finished his tedious speech in favour of his standard number, changed to 56276.— White of Indiana, Gordon, Everett, Bidlack, Fillmore, Caruthers, R. W. Davis, Pope, Bowne, Charles Brown, W. Cost Johnson and Cross, expatiated in common places, upon democracy, a large and a small house, the majesty of the people and the principle of representative Government, till at last the question was taken upon Briggs’s amendment 50179. to Atherton’s amendment 53875—striking out the number 60500. Adopted last Thursday.— Briggs’s amendment was first carried by tellers, and then as Athertons amendment amended 90 to 59— Halsted then by direction of the Committee of Elections moved an additional Section for districting the Union, so that every member should represent only one district— Upon which there sprung up a heated debate in the midst of which the Committee rose and the house adjourned— The Resolution for districting was first introduced by John Campbell of South-Carolina, who before the debate is over will see deeper into the millstone than he did. He offered the resolution for the protection of Slavery— Slavery will defeat its passage— Summer heat Heavy Thunder gust and rain. T. B. J. Frye here at tea. "

The last four or five days have been of midsummer temperature— Fahrenheit above 80. through the day; and we have slept with open windows at night.— The thundergust of yesterday followed by the soaking rain of last night, sunk the thermometer below 60, where it continued with a fresh northern breeze through this day— I called at Charles J. Nourse’s Office, and exchanged 12 half eagles, 6. Mexican and Spanish dollars and 21. old French crowns, for 92.55. in Virginia bills. At the house, Anderson Mitchell of North-Carolina was introduced by Mr Graham, sworn by the Speaker, and took his seat, as successor to Lewis Williams deceased. Horace Everett gave notice that he would move to-morrow to take the bill out of Committee at 12 O’Clock next Friday. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Allen of Maine in the chair on the apportionment bill— The question, upon the amendment offered by Halsted chairman of the Committee of Elections, and modified according to the Resolution first presented by J. Campbell of South-Carolina requiring that the States should be districted to return only one representative for each district— The debate waxed warm, and assumed at once a bitter and rancorous party aspect— Stanly, Goggin, Colquitt, Arnold, Garrett Davis, Summers, John G. Floyd , Houston, and Kennedy of Indiana, fought the battle, between State Sovereignty and Democracy, and between Slavery and Freedom involved in this question— There are now 3. free States, New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island and New-Jersey, returning 13 members and two Slave States Alabama and Georgia, returning 14. who elect by general ticket— Mississippi and Missouri, elect each two also by general ticket— The motion came from South-Carolina— State rights and nullification—but Campbell was not one individual of his party. Colquitt stoutly denied the Constitutional right of Congress to enact the districting of the States, and contended the Constitution by presenting that the members of the house of representatives should be chosen by the People absolutely required that every member should be chosen by the whole people. Summers made an excellent speech and produced a passage from the Madison papers fixing the meaning of the word manner in the constitution beyond all possibility of cavil; but Floyd, hunted up all the propositions of amendments in the State Conventions who adopted the Constitution, and used all those proposed amendments, upon this clause of the Constitution, as argument against the exercise of the power— Almost all the democrats who opposed the amendment declared their preference for the district system, but object to it as increasing the controul of Congress over the State Legislatures— Houston was keen upon Campbell— Kennedy is coarse and vulgar, and unreasonably; but not ineloquent—he did not finish. the Committee rose and the house adjourned at 4. The Ladies, evening at Mrs Frye’s. "

Thursday  I sent this morning for Robert Cruit and paid him 40 dollars on the check drawn upon the Bank of Washington for 120 dollars on the 24th. of January last by William S. Smith. He told me that he had accidentally met Mr Smith in the street in Philadelphia; and of the conversation that passed between them— Smith had written me part of it— I received another Letter from him last evening; and wrote him this evening authorising him to draw upon me for 20 dollars, the balance of the money payable to him for his deed of quit claim for his portion of the Braintree woodlot— Mr Charles Fletcher is my neighbour for the house—lodging with his family at Mrs Corcoran’s next door to Mrs Thornton— He is he tells me a native of Lancaster Massachusetts, but has lived some years in Virginia, and has some plan for urgind New-England farmers to remove into Virginia— His primary idea is that Land in Massachusetts costs more than the same surface of land in Virginia, plus the Slaves necessary for its cultivation— Mr Fletcher had by note requested an interview with me, for conversation and he now asked leave to call on me again for more conversation, which I cheerfully granted He left with me a Letter from his brother Thomas Fletcher a Silversmith at Philadelphia, who gives him a melancholy picture of the condition of that city—ruined by the ruin of the Banks, and especially of the Pennsylvania Bank of the United States— I gather from the Letter that both the brothers are themselves insolvent. At the house, Stanly chairman of the Committee on public expenditures, made a report, to which was annexed that of George Poindexter one of four Commissioners appointed by President Tyler in May 1841. to investigate the transactions of the New-York Custom-house— A long expected budget of dreaded and dreadful disclosures— Stanly moved that it should be laid on the table and printed; which was ordered without opposition, unawares to the house. But before the close of the sitting, Roosevelt moved a reconsideration of the vote to print, which the Speaker decided was not in order the vote having been taken without opposition; Roosevelt appealed, but the Speaker would not allow the appeal— My motion to print 10000 copies of Cushing’s report on the Colonial trade was contested Hopkins moved to reduce the number to 5000 and called the yeas and nays his motion was rejected 69 to 91. Everett moved according to his notice, to take the apportionment bill out of Committee to-morrow at 2. O’Clock— I objected, and he modified to next Tuesday. But his motion was laid on the table 84 to 80. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Allen in the chair on the apportionment bill— Kennedy of Indiana, finished his speech against the districting Section; followed by Payne of Alabama Barnard, J.

V:30 Friday  Morning visit from Mr Snelling of Boston, who brought with him, and gave me two pamphlets— The fifth annual report of the Massachusetts Board of Education, and of their Secretary Horace Mann— And a Speech of Abbott Lawrence at the Convention of shoe and leather dealers in Boston, on the 2d. of March last— I had much conversation with Mr Snelling on both these subjects, and also upon teaching of vocal music at the Schools— He reminded me that three or four years ago, he and Lowell Mason had visited me at Quincy to invite me to deliver an Address upon the opening of the Odeon, by the new Musical Association, and he read to me from Mr Mann’s report a Letter of enquiry upon the comparative merits of common workman, with the rudiments of common school educations and other persons of the same class without education— The letter was long; and I am ashamed to confess that just as he was finishing the reading of it, I dropped asleep— At the house, as soon as the journal of yesterday was read Briggs asked leave to offer a resolution calling upon the President for the reports of the Commissioners or any of them, for the investigation of the New-York Custom-house. Everett objected Briggs moved a suspension of the rules, which was carried and his resolution was finally adopted— Roosevelt then renewed his motion for reconsideration of the order to print Poindexter’s report, and his appeal from the decision of the Speaker that the motion was not admissible— After much altercation Everett moved to lay the appeal on the table; but before this question, the Speaker reversed his own decision, and received the motion for reconsideration—this brought on a tart and bitter debate, in which Wise arraigned the committee for presenting the report, and Poindexter for communicating it to the committee— At the same time he glorified Poindexter for making the report, which he said would prove to be the most powerful anti-tariff document that ever was presented to this house— And that the whole South and especially South-Carolina ought to erect an imperishable monument to his memory—but he could tell New-England Gentlemen, that some of the most distinguished men and highest families in Boston and Lowell would be implicated in charges of bribery and corruption, and it would ultimately involve every member from Massachusetts on this floor— Not a member from Massachusetts raised his voice to repel this imputation—but Stanly retorted with Wormwood and gall upon Wise— The motion for reconsideration was rejected 76 to 84— And the house took up private bills for engrossment and passage— Underwood moved an additional section to the bill for the relief of the legal representatives of Nimrod Farrow and Richard Harris which was carried by the casting vote of the Speaker— Adjourned.

Mr Fletcher called on me again this morning, and I returned to him his brother’s Letter— I had some further conversation with him upon his project of transferring a Colony of yankee farmers into Virginia which I gave him to understand I thought very hazardous, if not impracticable;—he has no doubt another plan not yet disclosed; that is to solicit my influence to obtain some place for him under the government—a project more hopeless than that of turning a yankee farmer into a Virginian— I received last evening a Letter of the 27th. from Dr E. H. Robbins of Boston, with a tariff memorial from himself, and about 30 other woolen manufacturers, with a request to me to present it, and have it referred to the Committee of Manufactures, and printed— This incident afforded me an opportunity to meet this morning Wise’s base and malignant attack yesterday, upon the manufacturers of Boston and Lowell, and upon every member of the Massachusetts delegation in the house— So immediately after the reading of the journal I addressed the Speaker, and asked the general consent of the house to present the memorial of Edward H. Robbins and about 30 other manufacturers, of Boston, Lowell and other places; and I said I should move its reference to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to whom was referred the tariff bill reported by the Committee of Manufactures, and that it be printed with the names of the signers— Hopkins and Charles Brown objected; but withdrew their objections, when I moved to suspend the rules, and referred to the attack by Wise yesterday, upon every member of the Massachusetts delegation. I then proceeded to comment upon Wise’s speech, which soon brought him up to explain—to disclaim—and to change his tone— It brought up Cushing too, and several others, till a rabid thirst appeared for an inflammatory general debate; which the Speaker decided must lie over till the next Petition day under the rule— Underwood appealed— Lott Warren moved to lay the appeal on the table, which was carried. Private bills were taken up. Tedious debate on motion to reconsider the engrossment of the Nimrod Farrow Bill—reconsidered—the bill rejected 84 to 43. L. W. Andrews changes his vote and then moves a reconsideration. Call of the house Quorum and no Quorum— Previous question— Abortive motions to adjourn— Message from the President, with the three reports of Poindexter, Kelly and Stewart on the investigation of the New-York custom-house— Wise moves to print them all, and makes another speech of an hour, apologetic and explanatory for himself, and vindicatory for the President— Adjourn at 6. O’Clock— Marine band music— I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer, and left with the foreman, the Memorial of E. H. Robbins and the woollen manufacturers to be published Monday Morning— Received afterwards a second Letter, from E. H. Robbins of the 28th. desiring to substitute another memorial for that which I have presented. "

                "text": "1. V:30. Sunday.  In consequence of the Letter received last evening from Dr. E. H. Robbins I went this morning to the Office of the National Intelligencer to take back the Memorial, which I had left there last evening for publication— I found at the Office only one labourer, and after looking round for the paper without success he took me to the house of Mr Donohue, with whom I had left the memorial— I roused Donohue from his bed, and said I had called at the Office to request the return of the Memorial, which he had promised to publish to-morrow morning—he said he would send it to me— He did so afterwards, and with it sent the manuscript report by Wheeler and Niles of my remark in the house yesterday— I went alone to the Capitol this morning, and heard Mr Tustin preach to a very thin auditory from Luke 14.18. “And they all with one consent began to make excuse.” The discourse was upon the indifference of, the generality of mankind to making profession of religion.— This is the ever-memorable parable, containing the words compel them to come in—the misconstruction of which has kindled all the fires of persecution in the Christian world— Mr Tustin took no notice of them but exhausted himself in a feeble scolding fit at the invited guests, who all with one consent begin to make excuse.— There is a curious contrast between the crowds that block up every avenue to the Speakers chair to hear tinkling cymbal Maffit and the half-empty seats of the members, when they have nothing to listen to but the languid fervour of this worthy man Tustin— There is no drop of nectar in his cup— On returning home I found the manuscript notes of my yesterdays skirmish, which needed little alteration— After dinner I attended Church, where Mr Hawley read the evening prayers for the fifth Sunday after Easter, and preached from Isaiah 55.8. [“]For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord 9. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways, higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.” The delusive propensity of mankind to consider their creator as made after their own image is a theme of easy but not very novel discourse— I walked out this evening with my wife and paid a visit at our neighbour General Jesup’s— He was not at home, but we saw Mrs Jesup. The latter part of the evening Walter Hellen spent with us.— Lieutenants Alden and Freeman who called to visit our ladies last Evening are the Aids de camp of the present commander in chief Major General Scott.

Mr Whitcomb has for some past held a temporary Office as a Clerk in the Post-Office Department. and has recently been dismissed as supernumerary He had been before, a clerk in the general Land-Office, and resigned on account of ill health— And yet before in the Custom house at Boston whence he was dismissed by the then Collector Daniel Henshaw—for understanding too well the duties of his Office— Under all these changes he has occasionally visited me, and this morning he came with a large budget of Letters recommendatory of him, all of which he exhibited, and read many of them to me— He is now about to return home to Vermont, but is yet an applicant for any office that may be or become vacant. Mr Peter Force, whose note to me will be payable on the 20th. of this month came to say that he had occasion to go immediately to Charleston South-Carolina, and should not be back till towards the close of the month; and he enquired if I could wait a few days for payment; which I told him I would cheerfully do—  There was heavy rain great part of this day, and precisely at the time when the Carriage came round from the stable to take me to the Capitol three successive claps of thunder within the space of as many minutes, with terrific flashes of lightning and torrents of rain. I was obliged to order the carriage back to the stable, and half an hour passed away before the storm had subsided so that I could start. It was thus half past eleven before I reached the house, and they had already passed a resolution moved by Briggs to adjourn over from next Thursday to Monday; to ventilate the hall, and substitute the Summer matting for the carpets— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union E. H. Allen in the chair— J. Campbell’s amendment for single districting the States W. Cost Johnson made a yea nay Speech, for the single district system, and against it in this bill—the instinctive expedient of unsteady minds— He was followed by just such another from John Pope, whose habitual practice is to reason in strength and vote in weakness—both these men think the amendment will fail, and they vote to be on the strongest side— Pendleton of Ohio, but a native of Georgia followed, with the most sensible speech he has made in the house, for the single district— Everett the same— Clifford sophisticated against it— Halsted, chairman of the Committee of Elections replied as well as he could to the objectors— Ferris of New-York began a long speech but the Committee rose, and the house passed a resolution to take the Bill out of Committee at 2. p.m. to morrow. Lord Ashburton came, and took the seat next to mine, till the house adjourned. "

A German, applicant for a pension and mendicant; having served in the army of the United States, found his way here in the midst of the storm, which continued through the Night and all this day with a third and violent thunder gust in the middle of the Night.— This was the day for the May-ball of Monsieur Labbé the dancing master, but was by him postponed till Thursday on account of the weather. At the house I presented the petition of John Foote and 117. Stone cutters for an appropriation to set them to work for finishing the treasury building. Referred to the Committee on the public buildings— I had attended the weekly meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, and found there before me Meriwether and A. H. H. Stuart— The other members—Caruthers, Everett, Granger, White and Cushing successively came in— There was a Letter on the table to me as Chairman of the Committee fromBabbit one of the claimants for indemnity on account of French spoliations before 1800.—enclosing a resolution which he requested me to present to the house this morning; to call up the bill on that subject reported by Mr Cushing—and to propose it should be made the special order of the day for the 12th. of May—but the Committee thought this would not be prudent— I read to the Committee a Letter I had received from Mr Edwin Bartlett, pressing the consideration of his memorial, claiming compensation as Chargé d’Affaires, for services during 2 years that he was Consul at Lima in Peru, and there was no diplomatic agent of the United States there. It was referred with other claims resting on similar grounds to Mr Stuart— I requested Instructions from the Committee to propose in the house a full outfit of Chargé d’Affaires for C Hughes, transferred from Stockholm to the Hague. The Senate have inserted in the appropriation Bill, only a half outfit for him— George W. Lay is appointed Chargé d’Affaires to Sweden in his place— The Committee agreed that I should move the increase, but Meriwether said he should oppose it— Shepperd was not present— In the house, Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, E. H. Allen in the Chair, on the apportionment Bill. Ferris concluded his speech against Campbell’s Districting Section; followed by a growling of Atherton on the same side till within ten minutes of 2. Sampson H. Butler of South-Carolina began a speech for districting which on being arrested at 2. he said he would expand in a newspaper. The Districting Section was carried in Committee by Tellers 95 to 92. and in the house by yeas and nays 101 to 99. The apportionment number fixed at 50179. The house to consist of 317 members. Everett’s amendment rejected without ceremony. He could not make it palatable to the house. Bill passed for engrossment, ayes 113. noes 87. and passed without division.— Adjourned at half past 4— Rain continued all the Evening— "

Wednesday  Mr Saltonstall called this morning, with three Gentlemen from the county of Essex, his constituents whom he introduced to me— They are concerned in manufactures and are here to look after their interests with regard to the approaching discussion upon the tariff—but they did not broach the subject to me— I had evening visits from Jonathan Roberts, Collector of the Customs at Philadelphia, and from Charles Hudson with a friend of his by the name of Hartwell— Hudson has hopes of a protective tariff—his hope will turn out a bubble.— I received this morning two Letters from Mr Thomas Loring of Hingham urging the immediate appointment of a Postmaster at that place, the present incumbent having resigned, and being in the last Stage of a consumption—unable to perform the duties of the office— I called at the general Post-Office, and finding 8 or 10 members of Congress, applied to Mr Philo C. Fuller one of his Assistants, to whom I gave to read one of Mr Loring’s Letters, and who assured me that the appointment should be made this very day— At the house after the usual quantum of interloping business, the order of the day was Wise’s motion to print the President’s Message received last Saturday, with all the documents relating to the investigation of the concerns of the custom house at New-York— Underwood who has been tumid with gestation of a Speech for years on executive usurpations now overladen with the additional burthen of his vote for reconsideration last Friday was now delivered, and he began by denying the lawful authority of the President to institute any commission to investigate the conduct or proceedings of any public officer without Statute Law— He censured Mr Tyler also for assuming the title of President of the United States—censured the committee on public expenditures—for producing Poindexter’s report—censured the house for hot haste in many of their acts—censured every one but himself and glorified himself all in the simplicity of his heart, and in perfect honesty. Proffit attempted to answer him, not by argument, but by charging inconsistency in the whigs, for questioning now the right of the President to institute an investigating commission, which they loudly applauded at the time when it was instituted— Then came Stanly, galled and goaded by the brutal attack of Wise on the Committee on public expenditures, he retorted upon him with such unmingled wormwood that Wise started up in his place and called him a coward; which Stanly repelled with scorn and defiance. Cushing then drew and brandished the sword of his eloquence against Stanly and Underwood; but soon stopped and the house adjourned— Jonathan Roberts related to me some strange events. Mr Hudson came here this Evening and introduced Mr Hartwell— "

Giddings was here—re-elected by a majority of upwars of 3000 of his old constituents of the 16th. Congressional District of Ohio— Mr Walter R. Johnson brought me a Letter of introduction from George W.

Andrews, sworn by the Speaker and took a Seat— The rest of the day was lost— The civil and diplomatic appropriation bill was received back from the Senate with a multitude of amendments which at Fillmore’s motion were ordered to be printed— Habersham a member of the Committee of Manufactures presented a long winded minority counter-report to that made some weeks since by Mr Saltonstall with his bill— An effort was made to introduce a Resolution rescinding the order to adjourn over from this day till next monday, but failed— Three successive motions to adjourn were rejected by yeas and nays—large majorities— A call of the house was refused— I moved the order of the day, the unfinished business of yesterday but Everett moved to adjourn the yeas and nays were evaded and the motion carried— Monsieur L’abbé the dancing master gave his May-Ball this Evening, at the Hall of the old Theatre Louisiana Avenue, My Granddaughter Mary Louisa, was the Queen of May— The Ball was very numerously attended—and it was near midnight when we came home— "

Mr Van Ness called upon me yesterday morning and enquired what had been done by the Committee of foreign Affairs with Mr Triplet’s Resolution respecting his accounts and receipt of monies as heretofore, Minister to Spain— I told him that all the papers of the case had been referred to one of the members of the Committee to report thereon, which had not yet been done. He enquired to which member it had been referred. I answered, as was true, that I did not recollect, but I thought it a question of doubtful propriety; though I said not so to him— He said his reason for asking it was that Mr Stuart lodged at the same house with Mr Triplet.— Mr Walter R. Johnson came again this morning and told me he had a Memorial to Congress, in charge of G. W. Toland one of the members of the house from Philadelphia—stating his claim of indemnity and compensation, for having been appointed by the then Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson, of one of the exploring expedition, in preparation for which he resigned a profitable occupation, incurred heavy expense in procuring an apparatus and instruments, and devoted many months of his time and labour, until he was finally dismissed with a notification that his services would not be required on the exhibition. Mr Johnson requested my friendly attention to the consideration of his claim, and gave me a small treatise recently published by him with the title of Notes on the use of anthracite in the manufacture of iron, with some remarks on the evaporating power.— He styles himself a civil and mining engineer—professor of chemistry, Natural philosophy, Mechanics and the kindred sciences, in sundry learned institutions— Morning visits from Mr Henry L. Ellsworth Commissioner of Patents with Jeremiah Day President of Yale College and five other learned gentlemen whose names I could not retain— Also from Mr William Radcliff, the Isthmian, and Mr John Connell of Philadelphia— I received from the foreman of the National Intelligencer Office, Grouard, a proof sheet of my report on the Smithsonian bequest, which I revised and took with me, to the Office; and there, gave Mr Grouard directions for the printing of the Appendix to the Report—leaving out much of the supplement to the report of 5. March 1840.— Evening visits from Mr Crespigny, and Captain Crofton. Mrs John Adams, Elizabeth, and Mary-Louisa went to a concert at Miss Brechard’s. I took a walk round the President’s house and department buildings this afternoon— Crofton and Crespigny are Officers of the British army stationed on the Island of Bermuda; visiting this Country, upon a leave of absence for six Months; and delighted as birds escaped from a cage at the first blossom of Spring.

I undertook this morning to assort in alphabetical monthly files the Letters that I have received since the commencement of the present year, but it absorbed all the leisure of the day, and did not half accomplish the work. Mr George Brown, of Beverley one of the persons introduced to me last Wednesday by Mr Saltonstall, called again this day, and after some suitable apology for asking of me a particular favour requested me, to write for him a paraphrase in verse of the 1st. and 2d. verses of the 61st. chapter of Isaiah— I told him it was a very hazardous thing to attempt a paraphrase in English verse from the Book of Isaiah. Pope was the only man I believed who ever had done it with success— Nevertheless, in the hope to gratify him, I would try my hand at this version and let him know the result in a few days— He also very urgently invited me to deliver the introductory Lecture before the Lyceum at their next Winters course, and said there were about 700 members of their Lyceum— I told him, if I should deliver any Lectures next Autumn, other than to the Quincy Lyceum and before the Massachusetts historical Society at Boston, I would hold myself engaged for the Lyceum at Beverley.— Mr Morehead, heretofore Governor, and now one of the Senators of Kentucky, visited us with his wife, as did Mr and Mrs Pope, with Mrs Wickliff, wife of the Postmaster General, Mary Cocke a grand daughter of Mr Pope, by his second wife, my wife’s sister Eliza, and Josephine a very pretty child of Johnson Hellen— I called at Lord Ashburton’s house to return his visit and those of the gentlemen attached to his mission, Bruce, Mildmay and Spedding—but they were gone to the race grounds—the week having been devoted to the Spring races— I called at Mr Thomas B. Johnson’s, and with him had about an hour of conversation— With my wife, Mrs John Adams and Elizabeth I attended an evening party at Mrs Madison’s. The Senators Preston and Rives with their families, Mr and Mrs Fletcher Webster—Archer—The Tayloe’s, Cutts’s—Henry Van Rensselaer and his wife—Lord Ashburton, and his family—Mrs Stewart—the British Officers Crofton and Crespigny, and sundry others were there— I took a hand at one rubber of whist, with Mrs Preston, Mrs Fletcher Webster, and Mrs Henry Van Rensselaer, a beautiful daughter of John Alsop King, and granddaughter of Rufus King— I then gave up my seat at the table— Lord Ashburton afterwards told me that he had received my card, and would be very glad to have a short conversation with me— I told him I would call at his house again, but he enquired at what time of the day he could probably find me at home. I said almost every evening. Henry A. Wise, assaulted and caned Edward Stanly this day on the race-course. "

There was this day no public worship this day at the Capitol— I attended the morning service at the second presbyterian church where Mr Clark preached from Psalm 16.11.—[“]In thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures forever more”— The first part of the verse,—Thou wilt show me the path of life—was omitted from the text— Mr Clark did not notice the reference to this passage of the Psalms, by Peter. Acts 2–25–31. where he says it is expressly prophetic of Jesus Christ and his resurrection, and denies that David said it of himself.— A critical and philosophical analysis of the two passages and a minute comparison between them might illustrate the nature and character of scriptural prophesy; and the same enquiry extended to all the passages of the old Testament, cited, referred or alluded to by Jesus and his apostles would furnish the materials for a deeply interesting dissertation. whether its results would be satisfactory may be doubted— Mr Clark confined himself to certain conjectures and surmises concerning the specific character of the enjoyments of heaven— After dinner at St. John’s church Mr Hawley read prayers for the Sunday after Ascension day, omitting the first lesson from the Old Testament, and giving for a Sermon, a very brief exposition of Psalm 36.9. “For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light.”— A text dark with excessive light— Mr Hawley commented upon the figurative language of the Scriptures, a subject of infinite importance and far beyond his grasp.

Adams dined with us, and remained here until Evening when we had visits from Mr King the Painter, and from Mrs Talbot’s son and daughter with her— The rumours about the assault of Wise upon Stanly on the race ground yesterday are various and uncertain but all distressing— "

V— Monday—  There was a notification in this morning’s National Intelligencer of a Meeting of the National Institute for the promotion of Science, at their Hall at 8 O’Clock this Evening— I had received some six weeks since a long wooden box carefully covered with Oil-cloth, from Dr T. G. Flügel, Consul of the United States at Leipzic in Saxony, and addressed to me. I had received last year a similar box, the contents of which were for the National Institute for the promotion which I had regularly presented to them, at their meeting on the 13th. of last December— Supposing that this box was intended also for the National Institute, I had left it unopened, until there should be a meeting of the Society; and I went to the Patent Office this Evening for that purpose— I found the outside door of the building locked, and no appearance of light within— I had been about half an hour belated, by bethinking myself before I left home to open the box, where I found nothing for the institute, but a long engraved print, of sundry public buildings in Leipsic, a despatch directed to President John Tyler—a despatch to Daniel Webster Secretary of State, and a despatch directed to me, with eight new small Saxon silver coins— The Letter to me, was a complaint with long and bitter lamentations, on the neglect to answer his former Letters by me, and the Secretaries of State and the Treasury, and especially of the disallowance at the Treasury of sundry items of his account amounting to 168 dollars 95 1/2 cents, 100 dollars of which are for what he calls a half uniform— And he sends this account, thus riddled at the Treasury Department with the charge upon me to make his remonstrances against its curtailments available— At the house after the usual half hour of surreptitious business introduced in evasion of all order the unfinished business of last Thursday was resumed and Cushing had the floor in reply to Underwood. He made a most anxious and elaborate and ostentatious defence of the right of the President to institute this investigating Commission— So sudorifically laboured that he brought me very seriously to doubt its legality. Underwood had indiscreetly and ignorantly alluded more than once to my appointment of Ministers to the Congress of Panama— Cushing took advantage of this, and called directly upon me for my purposes and views on that occasion, which I freely gave— I cited the appointments of Gouverneur Morris and of Paul Jones by President Washington— The controversy between Mr Madison and the Senate in 1814. and the appointment by Mr Monroe of Commissioners to South America, in 1818.— I abridged this part of Cushing’s speech— After a good deal of chaffering an order was passed to print the other reports and the testimony; and the debate was postponed to take up the Amendments of the Senate to the appropriation Bill. Adjourned after 4. "

He is one of the leading members of a party in that State, who have undertaken to atchieve a revolution in its government; by the formation of a Constitution upon the principle of universal suffrage, instead of the freehold qualification hitherto maintained, under the Charter of Charles the 2d. which that State has adhered to, instead of substituting for it as all the others of the old States have done a Constitution enacted by the People themselves— This freehold qualification of voters has been many years rankling and festering in the heart of the State and frequent attempts have been made in the Legislature, constituted as it was, to obtain a call of a convention to form a Constitution discarding the property qualification of voters— All these attempts having failed, a popular movement was concerted and organized last Summer, and unlicensed meetings, of disqualified persons in every town of the State, who chose delegates to a convention which met at Providence last November and formed a Constitution, afterwards, voted for by upwards of 13000 inhabitants of the State in popular meetings in December.— After this the regular Legislature called a Convention which formed and proposed a Constitution, which the qualified voters afterwards rejected— The suffrage party then proceeded to organize their government, elected their government Legislative and Executive—and they have held a Session of their Legislature, and have assumed by acts of Legislation the government of the State upon themselves— Pearce acted in this assembly as one of the Representatives from Newport.— In the meantime the regular Governor and Legislature have been elected; held a meeting and proclaimed all the proceedings of the Suffrage party unlawful; and applied to the President of the United States, for the military interference of the Government of the Union, which has been granted— Pearce, with several others of the suffrage party have been arrested and held to bail under a charge of treason against the State— I could not wait to converse with him, but asked him to call upon me again— He said he would unless he should leave the city this day.— I attended the Meeting of the Committee; and afterwards the meeting of the house, where the amendments of the Senate to the general appropriation bill, were debated—until near five O’Clock, when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— The amendment of the Senate increasing from 50,000 to 100000 dollars, the appropriation, for the Boston Custom-house was disagreed to by the Committee— R. C. Winthrop departed yesterday. "

Mr Giddings had yesterday requested an interview with me at my house this morning to which I had agreed and he came— He said that the army appropriation bill would shortly come up for the consideration of the house— There was an item of appropriation in it of 100000 dollars for the prosecution of the War in Florida, which he thought should be struckout— Mr Slade with whom he had conversed upon the subject, was of the same opinion; and they had thought it best to consult with me, concerning the expediency of making the motion— I said I concurred entirely in the opinion that the item ought to be struck out, but I was not sure that it would be advisable at the present time to make the motion— It would undoubtedly breed a tempest— The whole system of policy of the Country, foreign and domestic, War and Peace, Slavery and the Slave-trade would be opened for debate on this motion, and the public feeling on this topic was so lukewarm, and so perverted even in the free States, that I could not ward off the doubt of the expediency of agitating it at all, by starting the game ourselves— We were interrupted by Mr Radcliff’s coming in to talk about the communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans over the Isthmus of Panama— He intimated to me, that he was or would be an applicant for an appointment as a diplomatic agent to visit the isthmus, with a view to organize again some company to undertake the accomplishment of the work, with a guarantee of the principal powers of Europe and of the U.S. for the neutrality and freedom of the passage to all Nations, and at all times. Mr Radcliff spoke to me also about the claim of Mr Rhind, and about the Bill for deducting agent commissions from the awards in favour of certain claimants retained at the Treasury for debts due from the claimants themselves— At the house the day was again consumed in committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the Amendments of the Senate to the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill. an Amendment of the Senate appropriating 28000 dollars for completing the Custom-house at New-York, after a wrangling debate of two hours, was rejected by tellers 63 to 66. I moved to increase the half outfit for Christopher Hughes as Chargé d’Affaires to Holland, to a full outfit, and made a speech in support of the motion— John W. Jones opposed it with a speech— Joseph R. Ingersoll took the floor, and as it was 4. O’Clock moved the Committee to rise, which they did and the house adjourned— Mr Connell was here this Evening. He thinks the proceedings of the President of the United States, to suppress the Insurrection just proper and highly creditable. "

He held this office heretofore and wishes it now, for the purpose of visiting the Isthmus of Panama, on his way to Lima, with a view to the advancement of his project for the establishment of the communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, and he gave me the history of the several appointments to the Lima Consulate since his removal from it by Andrew Jackson— The last was Edwin Bartlett, who resigned some months since and there is now before the Senate the nomination of a Frenchman named Castelnou, who is now in France.— Mr Radcliff supposes him to be a dormant partner of a commercial house in Lima— He has applied to the Secretary of State and to the President for this appointment, and has been curiously sported with by the, chief magistrate and the head of the Department in their different allegations to him, to account for the nomination of a foreigner in competition with him— He has some expectation that the Nomination will not be confirmed, in which he will however be disappointed. At the house, in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union the amendments of the Senate to the Appropriation Bill were resumed and Joseph R. Ingersoll supported by a speech my amendment to increase the half outfit for Christopher Hughes upon his new appointment as Chargé d’Affaires at the Hague, to a full outfit The question upon my amendment in Committee was taken by tellers and carried 67 to 63. and afterwards in the house by yeas and nays 88 to 72— After much debate, we carried also the disagreement to an amendment of the Senate, to deprive the Secretary of State of the means of compensating dispatch Agents at New-York, Boston Liverpool and London— The house adopted the amendments reported by the Committee to the Senate’s amendments after which several executive communications were disposed of and the house adjourned at 4. O’Clock.— I Received at the Franklin Insurance Office a Semi-annual dividend, and paid 8 per cent premium for 100 dollars of Virginia Bank Bills, and called before and after Sunset on Mr T. B. Johnson and paid him the balance of 134 dollars 25 cents on his draft of 530 dollars We had an evening party—Mrs Madison and 50 or 60 others young and old— Music, dancing—Cards—Whist with Mrs Madison, Mrs B.

Friday  Mr Thompson called on me this morning to communicate to me some information respecting the cultivation of sugar from the cane with reference to the revisal of the Tariff, which must shortly be brought up for the consideration of Congress— He said there was great injustice and much fraud committed in consequence of the two denominations under which the duties are levied upon sugars—brown and clayed: and he spoke of some new invention for the manipulation of sugar which he had used upon his plantation in Louisiana, and with which the labour of eight men can be performed by one. He said if I would call at his house at some leisure time he would shew and explain its operation to me, and I promised to call.— He spoke also of the condition of his claim upon Mexico, which is very large, and which the late joint commission have left without a definitive decision upon its amount. At the House this was a day for the consideration of debatable private bills, but after the adoption of a Resolutions offered by Thompson for a Committee of investigation concerning the furnishing of the new Custom house at New-York, Fillmore sent to the Clerk’s table a Letter to him from the Secretary of the Navy, stating that a draught on the Department for an inconsiderable sum, had for want of funds at the Department been necessarily protested; and on that Letter Mr Fillmore, founded his motion to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the Navy Appropriation Bill—which was carried— Clifford of Maine in the Chair— The first item, for the pay of the officers and men was upwards of three millions— Meriwether of Georgia moved to reduce it nearly a million, to the sum appropriated last year— Fornance of Pennsylvania made a feeble attempt at a retrenchment speech; but was so little headed that he soon got out of humour, sat down and refused to proceed. A long and rambling debate ensued, upon the promotions and new appointments of Officers within the last year; a disproportionate number of whom are from Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia— Wise, the Chairman of the naval Committee, was argufying before a magistrate against the right of the Judge to bind him over to keep the Peace, out of the District— He came in at last and frightened Meriwether out of his economy, by the terror of Bermuda, the Gulf of Mexico, and abolitionism.

Gurley’s published account of his mission to England in behalf of the colonization Society.— And referring to an item of appropriation of 5000 dollars for commercial agents on the coast of Africa introduced into the Bill as an Amendment to one of the Senate’s amendments at the motion of Wise, and with the support of Underwood, he said it was a mere grant to that Society of that sum of money in disguise— That it had been represented as an expenditure for commercial purposes and the pretension that the British Government kept commercial agents on the coast of Africa with the intent to monopolize the trade there for English merchants— But it was all imaginary— The trade in palm oil, used in Europe for making soap was considerable and increasing but there were no English commercial agents on the coast; and never had nor can there be any good use for such agents from this Country.— At the house Henry Dodge the Delegate from the Wiskonsin territory offered a resolution of enquiry of the Secretary of the Treasury, imputing gross official malversation to James D. Doty the present Governor of the Territory, and with a long and vilifying preamble; which upon objection being made to its reception was received by suspension of the rules— Howard of Michigan moved to strike out one of the accusatory whereases—which was carried. The previous question was then sprung— I objected both to the remainder of the preamble and to parts of the Resolution; avowing my readiness to vote for any motion of enquiry as to facts; but I was estopped from all argument. I moved to lay the whole matter on the table—lost by yeas and nays 26 to 158. and the resolution and the preamble were driven through like a loco-motive on a rail-road— Triplett moved a resolution of enquiry concerning certain recent promotions of Lieutenants in the Navy, but could not obtain a suspension of the rules for its consideration— The general appropriation bill returned from the Senate, receding from some of their amendments and insisting upon others, was then taken up— The house receded from one or two of theirs and insisted upon all the rest— A Committee of conference was appointed— Fillmore, myself and Cave Johnson.— At 4 the House adjourned. Mrs John and Elizabeth, with Mary-Louisa, went to Mount-Vernon, with Richard and Mary Cutts, Mrs Stuart, Miss Gardner, Walter Hellen and the two English officers Crespigny and Crofton.

O’Clock this morning and continued till the dawn of day, and of which I knew nothing till it was over when I awoke, much alarmed at the trampling over my head, in our house, and the loud talking whence I feared it was from sudden illness in the family. The fire had been in the next Street, to that in which we live, and running nearly parallel and concentric with ours— There were burnt down a small dwelling house—the back building of another, occupied by Henry Van Rensselaer, a member of the House from the State of New-York, and his wife and their children, who were burnt out, but all saved— A stable with a Carriage and horses, and a Mechanics shop in which were deposited many wooden works belonging to the Patent Office— There has scarcely been a day for weeks without one or more alarms of fire— Several of them are ascertained to have been kindled by incendiaries— There is no doubt it was so in this case— The Mayor has issued a proclamation offering a reward of 300 dollars for detection of the culprit; but as yet without effect.— The morning was rainy— I attended the morning public worship at the Capitol, where Mr Maffitt preached from John 3.16— [“]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believith in him should not perish but have everlasting life”— There were not more than 40 persons present, and the services were very short— Mr Maffitt said he had been confined to a sick bed, and was now labouring under a very severe headache— That he was willing to preach at any time and at all times, and would preach next Sunday at the request of several persons from the text “joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.” A silent enquiry occurred to me, whether this request came from the fact that Mr Maffitt had already preached a popular discourse on this text, or whether it was an allusive indication of his own experiences. Before dinner I had a morning visit from Sir John Caldwell, recently arrived from the Province of New Brunswick, and after dinner Captain Crofton and Lieutenant Crespigny of the 20th. Regiment of foot; absent upon leave from their regiment stationed at Bermuda, came and took leave going in the Cars to Baltimore— At St. John’s, Mr Hawley read prayers for Whitsunday evening, and preached from Isaiah 40.1.2.

These two and the three following verses have in them an awful sublimity still deepened by the versification of Pope’s Messiah, and the music of Handel’s anthem— This morning at 9 O’Clock I attended at the chamber of the Senate’s Committee of Finance the Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses upon the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill— The managers on the part of the Senate, were George Evans of Maine, Silas Wright of New-York, and Berrien of Georgia— Those of the House were Millard Fillmore myself, and Cave Johnson— Fillmore and myself were in favour of all the points insisted on by the Senate, but Cave Johnson was perfectly intractable upon every point— Sundry concessions, were concerted between the two chairman to pacify Cave, but it was all in vain— He would agree to nothing, and Fillmore and I were finally obliged to accede to a compromise offered by the Managers of the Senate; and the house had been nearly an hour in Session when we made our report— I found Levy the jew delegate from Florida making a red hot speech against the President’s Message, declaring his intention to put an end to the Florida War— The question was upon printing the message, and referring it to the Committee on the Territories which after some sparring of Cushing and Mark A. Cooper was carried.— Fillmore then presented the report of the joint Committee of Conference; upon which the speaker at first decided that the question must be taken upon the whole report at once— This is the parliamentary Law; but Atherton insisted on taking a separate question upon every point of difference; and produced a precedent to which the Speaker yielded.— Separate questions were taken on each point Cave Johnson made a bitter speech against the adoption of several parts of the report— It proposed a compromise of 75000 dollars for the custom house at Boston— It was taken by yeas and nays and carried 99 to 75.— The report for the New-York custom-house was conditional—carried also by yeas and nays. 92 to 73— The Senate adopted the report of the Committee of conference by one vote, and notice of it was received by message to the House— The naval appropriation Bill was then taken up, and in the midst of a foolish speech of Reynolds of Illinois the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— Evening with my wife, Mrs John and Elizabeth at the concert given by Braham and his Son— Met there Mr George Brown, who introduced Braham to me.

                "text": "17— V. Tuesday.  Mr Frazee called on me yesterday morning, before I went to the Capitol, to explain an unlucky incident, which has occurred within a few days, implicating his character— A paper purporting to be a copy of a Letter from the late Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury, of 3. March 1841. was furnished by him to the Committee of Ways and Means, and was read in the house by Mr Fillmore to shew his authority for expenditures to the amount of 28200 dollars, for finishing and furnishing the New-York Custom-house. A copy of the same Letter from Mr Woodbury, was contained in Poindexter’s report, differing from that furnished by Frazee, and this difference had been pressed as a falsification by Poindexter— Upon examination it was found that Poindexter’s copy was correct while in that of Frazee there were several interpolated words— When called upon to account for this he said he had made the copy from Memory. A gross indiscretion, which has subjected him to the imputation of fraud— This morning I attended the Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs— I was myself belated a quarter of an hour, and found at the Committee-room only two members—Stuart and Meriwether— It was past ten, before we formed a quorum. Shepperd, Everett, Caruthers, White, and Cushing, successively came in— Only Granger absent—gone home. Several private claims were considered— One of a French Captain of a Merchant vessel named Beziers, asking for a grant of Land in consideration of his having saved the lives of the crew of an American vessel which in the year 1825 perished in the harbour of Cadiz—and another of the Captain and owner of the Spanish ship Sabine for saving the crew of an American vessel foundered at Sea— These cases were referred to Mr Cushing for a report.— In the house, William Cost Johnson moved a suspension of the rules for a joint Resolution to close the Session on the 15th. of June—lost 56 to 94. Navy appropriation Bill in Committee of the whole, Clifford in the chair— Reynolds, Mallory, Cushing, Triplett debated— Sprigg was labouring with a Speech, but wanted a whole morning for delivery and would not begin.— Cushing pushed through a couple of small bills from the Committee of foreign Affairs— Wise got up his bill to appoint a board to prepare a new system of rules and laws for the regulation and government of the Navy— I took part in this debate— The Bill laid aside— Adjourned after 4.— I dined at Lord Ashburton’s— My wife was invited, but declined. Mrs Madison, Mr and Mrs Preston Mr and Mrs Rives, Mr and Mrs Evans, Bayard, Bodisco, Calhoun, Choate, Legare, and Genl. Tallmadge were there. Long conversation with Lord Ashburton. "

Mr Lewis Johnson called on me this morning, and spoke of the condition of the claims on the Government which he as Administrator on the Estate of the late William Otis has pending— With the assistance of Francis S. Key as Counsel as Agent, he has recovered already several thousand dollars— There is yet a contested claim for interest, upon which he has at last obtained favourable reports from the auditor and comptroller of the Treasury; and they are now before the President for his approval. Mr Johnson expressed a wish that I would see the President, and state to him the facts known to me concerning William Otis and this claim; which I promised to do— Mr Thompson also called on me, to speak of the debate yesterday upon the board to prepare a body of rules and regulations for the government of the Navy. He said he was gratified by the remarks that I had made respecting the composition of the board; and that he had this morning reminded the Secretary of the Navy of the claim which the engineers of the War Steamers would have to be represented in that board— Mr Upshur had told him that it was altogether a matter of indifference to him, how the board should be composed— I told Mr Thompson that I would see and converse with the Secretary of the Navy on the subject— He said that his deep interest in it arose from the fact that he had two sons in the engineering service of the Steamers. In the House, Underwood, Chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, did at last obtain from the house an order setting apart the first and second days of June for the consideration of the District business. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Clifford in the chair, on the Navy Appropriation Bill— Sprigg of Kentucky made a long speech in support of Meriwether’s Motion to retrench nearly one million of dollars upon the item of pay for the Officers and Seamen of the Navy— Mason of Ohio followed in a speech full of honest principle, sound reasoning and curious and instructive details— Gwin of Mississippi made one worthy of a repudiator of honest debts— Everett, Gamble, Pendleton, Fillmore, followed, the debate still waxing in interest, till M’Kay took the floor; the Committee rose, and the house adjourned. In the Evening we had as visitors Captain Talcott with Richard Cutts junr, and Charles A. King the painter, with Mr Healy also a painter, an American recently from Paris, where he painted a full length portrait of the king Louis Philippe and also one of his prime minister Guizot, ship’d as presents by the Americans at Paris to Congress, or to the President’s house, but they have not yet arrived.

Mr Thompson came again this morning, and had a short note from Mr Upshur the Secretary of the Navy, stating that he would readily meet and confer with me, on this bill for appointing a board to prepare rules and regulations, for the government of the Navy.— At 10. O’Clock I went to the President’s house, but the Secretary of War was with him, and in the entry, and rooms below, and in the chambers above, there were eight or ten solitary Strollers to and fro, waiting for admission to the President, all except one member of Congress, wolves of the antichamber, prowling for Offices I waited about half an hour, and then gave the despatch from Dr Flügel the Consul at Leipsic, to a servant requesting him to deliver it to the President and left the house— I went to the Navy Department and held an hours conference with the Secretary Abel P. Upshur, upon the proposed revisal of the rules and regulations of the Navy and the re-organization of the Department.— As to the composition of the board I found that his expectation was to prepare the revisal of the rules and regulations himself, and to submit them to the board as a council— He was earnest to retain the Officers of the several degrees from the Post Captain, down to the Lieutenant in the board; but he thought it very proper to include an eminent lawyer, and also an Officer of the Marine Corps, but if he is to prepare a revised code himself it is doubtful whether any board of Officers be necessary at all— I spoke also to him of the Court Martial upon Captain Clack, and the statement of L. W. Tazewell; and the Letter from Silas Wright, upon which Mr Upshur’s opinion appeared to coincided with mine— What the practical result will be, I shall wait to see.— The house had been nearly an hour in session when I reached it— M’Kay was in the midst of a very searching speech against the high appropriations of the Navy-bill— Fillmore had already carried in the house a resolution to take out the Bill, from the Committee next Monday. Meriwether’s amendment reducing the appropriation, nearly one million of dollars for pay of officers and Seamen, was carried by a vote of 72 to 53— Triplett then moved an amendment providing that no part of the appropriation should be applied to pay officers suspended by sentence of a court martial, or officers who have been more than five years out of service— This gave rise to a warm debate, which continued till past 4. and in which I took part in opposition to the amendment and to an amendment to it, proposed by Lott Warren— When I closed, Arnold took the floor, the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Evening visit from Mr Henry Dana Ward of New-York.

The President went in grand military parade this morning to Baltimore to review the encampment on the borders of that city—but rain is a mortal foe to the glories of military triumph in the piping times of peace— Mr Tyler returned to the White house, this evening as he had gone forth from it this morning, escorted by the Commander in chief of the army without so much as an ovation, gathered from the tented field— He did not even visit the encampment. In the house, Pendleton of Cincinnati Ohio, offered a Resolution calling on the Secretary of the Navy for documents relating to the construction of the engine for a steamer contemplated to be employed on the lakes— Cushing objected— Pendleton moved a suspension of the rules, carried by yeas and nays, after a call of the house commenced and superseded 106 to 46— Pendleton then made a speech, and moved the previous question, which and the resolution itself were carried without a division— The Speaker presented a Letter from Samuel Lawrence and William W. Stone complaining that in the report of Poindexter there are changes imputing dishonest and dishonourable conduct to them, and declaring their readiness, if the house think fit to submit to any scrutiny for the vindication of their conduct and reputation— And he presented a Letter from Poindexter himself, asking for the appointment of a select committee to examine the statements in his report and the evidence upon which he relies to support them— Mr Saltonstall moved that the Letter from Lawrence and Stone should be laid on the table and printed—which was ordered— Garrett Davis moved to refer Poindexter’s Letter to the Committee on the public expenditures— Fillmore to lay it on the table and print it. Bowne moved to lay on the table and print on the motion to refer and print and refer on the table—carried by yeas and nays 104 to 59— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the Navy appropriation bill, Clifford in the Chair— Triplett undertook to support his amendment, by a speech, but it was voted down, as well as Warren’s amendment to it— A ludicrous altercation followed between Charles Brown and Mallory about the comparative demerits and merits of the Navy yards at Norfolk and Philadelphia; and of the Naval asylum on the Schuylkill— M’Lellan of Kinderhoek then moved another restrictive amendment—countenanced by Everett— M’Kay made a powerful speech against any increase of the appropriations— Cushing commenced an answer—the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— Nathaniel Carusi was here this Evening.

The chill North-easter continues; but this day without rain— I wrote lines in the album of Anna Payne, Mrs Madison’s niece—and in the Boston Mercantile Journal, edited by a man characteristically named Sleeper Mr. G. Brown has published with a puff, my paraphrase of the 1st. and 2d. verses of the 61st. chapter of Isaiah written at his request. Not a day passes but I receive Letters from the North and sometimes the West asking for an autograph, and a scrap of poetry or of prose, and from the South almost daily Letters of insult, profane obscenity and filth— These are indexes to the various estimation in which I am held in the free and servile sections of this Union— Indexes to the moral sensibilities of free, and of Slavery tainted communities. Threats of Lynching and Assassination, are the natural offspring of Slave-breeders and Slave-traders—profanity and obscenity are their natural associates;—such dross the fire must purge— But the perpetual calls for autographs and Album scraps, are scarcely less annoying in another way— They set in motion the rhyming maggot in my brain and breed swarms of May flies as prolific as the dead herrings that line the banks of the Potomac.— I laboured with an abortion upon Faith this morning, and with another anti belligerent speech, on this navy-appropriation bill. At the house, after a struggle by Cowen, chairman of the Committee of Claims pleading for the devotion of this day to private business, the house at Fillmore’s motion decided by yeas and naystoto go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union on that bill— Cushing had the floor from yesterday and made an elaborate speech of two hours in defence of the administration, and of the Secretary of the Navy and his report— His argument as usual was captious and sophistical; attempting to shew that the Secretary’s plan did not urge a present increase of the Navy; but that M’Kay and Meriwether were contending for a decrease of the existing navy— Cushing affects to be the leader of the administration members, and is much flattered when recognized by the whigs and democrats, as a Cabinet Minister, of the white house in petto: as was done by M’Kay and Meriwether, in replying to him this day; which they did with great earnestness. Parmenter, made a sly, jesuitical, Mrs Candour attack upon the Commissioners of the Navy, and especially upon Commodore’s Hull and Morris—which I briefly noticed— The Committee rose and the house adjourned soon after 3.— The bloodless termination of the Rhode-Island War was this day received— The ignominious flight of the spurious governor Thomas W Dorr, has postponed the heaviest calamity that ever befel this Nation—but I scarcely dare yet to rejoice.

Sunday  I went, with Mrs John Adams, her daughter Mary Louisa, and Miss Cutts to the Capitol, heard Mr Maffitt deliver his sermon, from Luke 15.7. “I say unto you that like wise, joy shall be in heaven, over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.[”] He omitted these last underscored words— He said it was not his custom to preach from given texts; but he had received an anonymous letter in very respectful terms requesting him to preach from this beautiful text, and he took pleasure in complying with the request— I still believe that it was intended for, and felt to be a stab Joab-like under the fifth rib, whether merited or not, certainly given in no Christian Spirit— The Sermon itself indicated the performance of an unwelcome task. The house was full but not crowded— Mr Maffitt’s oratory is superficial, flashy and shallow, but very attractive— There is a difficulty in the sentiment of this text, which seems to countenance the idea that in Heaven itself reformed wickedness is more estimable than stedfast and unsullied virtue.— Mr. Maffitt could not grapple with this difficulty, nor did he once allude to the incomparable parable of the prodigal Son, introduced by this text and illustrative of its meaning. Mr Maffitt gave notice that he should preach at the Capitol next Sunday upon the resurrection—and that he expected to preach this Evening at the Wesleyan chapel— Pass’d Midshipman Joseph H. Adams dined with us. After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley read the evening service for Trinity Sunday, and Mr Laird from Indiana, preached from 1. Peter 2.7. [“]Unto you therefore which believe, he is precious; but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner.” The Sermon was a discourse upon the various considerations whereby Jesus Christ should be precious to all believers. After church I called to visit Mr Thomas B. Johnson, but he was riding out— We had evening visits from Richard Cutts junr. and his Sister with Anna Payne, Mrs Madison’s niece, quite delighted with my lines written in her Album, but anxiously earnest to know whether any other person had ever read them, before I sent them to her—while Miss Cutts was not pleased that they were so much prettier than those I had written for her. Mr Richard Rush likewise took tea with us—he has been here several days— He says, only for the settlement of some private concerns of his own. Long conversation with him on the Colonial trade questions. "

Mr Thomas C Williams came this morning, in behalf of his brother, who, he reminded me, was here last Spring, a candidate for the appointment of Collector of the Customs at Fall river, Massachusetts. The Office was not then vacant— Phineas W. Leland was, and yet is the incumbent; but his term of four years expires on the last day of this month, and Mr Seth Williams renews his application for the appointment— Messrs. Sayles and Livermore of Boston and Mr Lambert of New-York, are agents and delegates here from the woolen manufacturers of the North— They came to consult and ask aid of me for that interest upon the expected revisal of the Tariff— They were especially anxious to know my opinion of the prospects of the manufactures before Congress at the present Session. I could give them but cold comfort, and told them that I had requested to be relieved from the Office of chairman of the Committee of manufactures, after ten years of service in it, absolutely despairing of the possibility of doing any good by continuing in it— And I had no hope that any effective tariff either for protection or for revenue, would be adopted by Congress at this Session— They said they were not satisfied with the rate of duty upon broad cloths, proposed either by the Bill of the Secretary of the Treasury or by that of Mr Saltonstall—but the duty which they would prefer would be of 75 cents the square yard—taking the average of the price of the article at 3 dollars a square yard—equivalent to 25 per cent ad valorem. At the house immediately after the reading of the Journal Fillmore moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Carried without a struggle, and the Navy Appropriation Bill was taken up, and debated by M’Kay, Fillmore, Gwin and M’Keon till one O’Clock, when the question was taken on Everett’s amendment to M’Lellan’s amendment and lost—and on M’Lellan’s amendment which was carried—sundry other senseless amendments were offered and lost and the bill was reported to the house— There Meriwether’s amendment was carried by yeas and nays 112 to 89. and M’Lellan’s 100. to 94.— The bill passed by a vote of 171 to 36. I was just then called out to speak to C. Hughes and on returning to my seat found the house again in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Underwood in the Chair upon the Bill, for the appointment of a board to revise the rules and regulations for the navy, which after debate was at my instance changed to a Resolution calling on the Secretary of the Navy and Attorney-General to prepare and report such a plan to the House at the next Session— Army Appropriation Bill— Committee rose. House adjourned. C Hughes—W. Radcliff—Mrs Thornton Mrs Talbot and her daughter. "

Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Present Adams, Stuart, Meriwether, Caruthers, Granger, Cushing, White, and Shepperd—absent Everett— Stuart made reports in favour of the claims of John A. Smith, the legal representatives of Daniel Brent and Edwin Bartlett for service as acting chargés d’affaires of the U.S. in England, France and Peru— The reports were accepted and Stuart was authorised to present them to the house.— I asked the direction of the Committee to propose to the house to fix a day for the consideration of the claims of indemnity for French spoliations prior to the year 1800. which with some opposition was agreed to.— In the House, attempts were made by several members to shove in Reports of Committees and Resolutions, and A. H. H. Stuart; alledging that he should be obliged to leave the city to-morrow morning for Virginia, succeeded in making the three reports accompanied with Bills, for the relief of John A. Smith of the legal representatives of Daniel Brent, and of Edwin Bartlett, which were read twice, ordered to be printed and referred to the whole house on the state of the Union— The house then went into that committee, Underwood in the chair upon the army appropriation bill— On the first item of appropriation being for the pay of the army Cave Johnson moved a reduction of 305,700 dollars, or about one fifth of the amount— Meriwether moved a proviso to suspend the operation of the act of 1838 increasing the army, which the Chairman decided not to be in order, whereupon Cave Johnson withdrew his amendment to reduce the amount of pay, and moved an amendment providing that no part of the appropriation should be applied to pay Officers hereafter appointed hereafter appointed or soldiers enlisted till the army shall number not more than 5000 men— Fillmore objected to the amendment as not in order— The chairman decided that it was— Morgan took an appeal too late, and I moved an amendment to that of Cave Johnson by substituting the standard of the act of 1821. 6000 men, instead of 5000 which Cave Johnson accepted. And now the debate for the reduction of the army commenced. W. O. Butler, Ward, Fillmore, and W. Cost Johnson warmly resisted the reduction— C. H. Williams—Reynolds, and W. B. Campbell, supporting the amendment. Sharp altercation between Black of Georgia and Granger upon a heavy charge by Black against the army; who were vigorously defended by Granger, upon which Black denied that he had made any charge against the army.— Thompson of Indiana and Elisha H. Allen stiffly objected to the reduction; and M’Kay opened his formidable battery for it— The Committee rose— I moved to fix the 31st. of this month to consider the French claim Bill, but failed— I attended with Mrs John, Elizabeth C. and Mary Louisa, an evening party at General Jesup’s.

Mr Leavitt called on me this morning, with a young Quaker from Philadelphia named Miller who was here last Summer during the extra Session, and who now brought me a kind remembrance from Samuel Webb.— Morning call also from Mr Whittlesey, Auditor of the General Post Office, with his son of whom he introduced to me— In the house it had yesterday been agreed that the Committees should be called for reports this morning, which was done. Among the reports made by Cowen, chairman of the Committee of Claims was a joint resolution from the Senate for a rule to take from claimants the right of reproducing claims which have been once rejected, unless with a certificate from a member of Congress, that he believes the claim to be just.— I objected to this addition to the joint rules, and protested against it, as restrictive upon the right of petition, which I considered as peculiarly requiring the observance and respect of the house with regard to claims against the Government for the satisfaction of which has no resort to the judicial tribunals. Cave Johnson moved to make the Resolution the special order of the day for next Friday week; but could not carry a vote of two thirds and it lies over. Numerous other reports of Committees were made, and among the rest Meriwether from the Committee on the public expenditures, made a detailed and thorough retrenchment report, with four bills, cutting deep into the army, the navy, the pay of the Officers of the federal government, and the expenses in the collection of duties on imports— I renewed the motion, by direction of the Committee of foreign Affairs, to fix a day, the 31st. of this month to consider the French claim Bill— Cushing called the yeas and nays which were 83 to 86. motion lost— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, M’Kay in the chair, upon the Army Bill— M’Kay resumed his argument, and offered an amendment as a substitute for that of Cave Johnson, which Johnson accepted.— M’Kay proposed to reduce the numbers of men in the artillery and infantry regiments to the standard of the act of 2. March 1821. 42 men to each company; and to disband the second Regiment of dragoons, or to melt it up into a regiment of riflemen.— Fillmore objected to M’Kay’s amendment, as not in order. the chairman decided that it was Cushing appealed, and that question was debated till the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Mr Fisher of Philadelphia exhibited to me a diagram of the diversity of climates— We had a small dinner party at home— "

I had received a polite invitation from Mrs Jones, wife of Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones, now absent, Commander of the Squadron on the pacific Ocean, to an evening party at Sharon, her residence, in Fairfax County Virginia, about nine miles from this city: and a note from Mr Henry Dana Ward of New-York city, but a native of Massachusetts, urging me, in very flattering terms to attend, it being the occasion of his marriage with Miss Charlotte Galbraith of Dublin Ireland— Mr W. W. Irwin, member of the house from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, had informed me yesterday that he was also going to this party, and I agreed to take a hack jointly with him. In the house David Levy the alien Jew delegate from Florida moved a call for correspondence of the Commanding Officer of the army in Florida with the War Department, since the 1st. of January last, and a Resolution that there should be no cessation of hostilities, till the Seminoles shall be effectively subdued— He told of a whole family butchered since the first of this month—part of his first resolution was adopted— The call of Reports from Committees was concluded from yesterday and multitudes of them were made— One from retrenchment Gilmer about pay-mileage and franking.— One from John C. Clark from Committee of Commerce on the light-house establishment, with a bill. Hiland Hall, chairman of the select Committee on the Memorial of William Wright reported a Resolution authorizing the Committee to go to Boston, to send for persons and papers and to take testimony— Objections bristled up from the democracy—quite eager for the investigation; but averse to the Committees going to Boston— Romulus M. Saunders moved to strike out that power—carried by yeas and nays 80 to 96— The fraud being thus effectually screened the Committee were authorised to send for persons and papers and to take testimony. Van Buren a demo member of the Committee, conscious of the humbug moved to lay the whole subject on the table; but I called for the yeas and nays and he withdrew his motion— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Underwood in the chair on the army appropriation bill.— Cushing made a speech of three hours against the reduction and retrenchment. Gilmer discoursed an hour in reply to him—civil war in the corporal’s guard— The Committee rose and the house adjourned short of 4. O’Clock. Mr Irwin and Mr Cushing came in the hack at 5. and took me up. We rode through Georgetown and over the canal and river bridges, to Sharon, where we were received by Mrs Commodore Jones, and the adjutant General Roger Jones, his brother— The Marriage ceremony was performed by Dr Thomas Balch of Georgetown.— The members of Congress present were Brockway, Choate, Cushing, Hudson, Irwin, Maxwell, Morgan, Rencher, Roosevelt, Saunders, Summers, and Taliaferro.— Mrs Morgan, Mrs Rencher and sundry other Ladies were there. Heavy rain, a pitch dark Night and Virginia roads, constrained me to pass the Night there— Slept in a room with Rencher, two beds on the floor. "

I rose soon after 5, and found Mr Irwin risen before me— He sent for our driver who had put up his horses and carriage at a neighbouring tavern— The rain had subsided, but the sky was yet beclouded— Commodore Jones’s seat is a Paradise in the wild, under his cultivation. The house was surrounded by trees, which were alive with the music of mocking-birds and robins, which reminded me of the Nightingales of little Boston-house at Ealing.— Two Mr Stuarts, father and son, with Mr Taliaferro amused us with conversation till our Carriage came— The rest of our company who had remained over night had not yet risen, and just at 6. Mr Irwin and I started for home, leaving Cushing who was one of the groomsmen, undisturbed in bed— Mr Irwin stopped at his lodgings in the seven buildings, and the Clock at the Treasury building struck 8 as I passed by it on my way home. After breakfast, Mr Leavitt called upon me with the Madisonian newspaper of last Monday, which I had yesterday expressed to him the wish to see— It contains more than one ferociously belligerent articles which as the Madisonian is avowedly the Tyler organ, has excited much notice and some apprehension of the Tyler policy— At the house, Pendleton, from the Committee of Military Affairs presented a report and a bill for the establishment of military posts beyond the rocky mountains and at the mouth of the Columbia river— The Bill was read twice and referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.— Stanly moved to print 5000 extra copies of the report. Cave Johnson objected, and after discussion the motion was laid over— Fillmore obtained leave for the Committee of Ways and Means during the sitting of the house till the army appropriation bill shall be resumed. Underwood obtained permission for the same thing for the Committee on the District of Columbia, for to-morrow. W. B Campbell moved a retrenchment resolution to reduce the army diffent from any one yet proposed; but it was laid on the table— Meriwether took advantage of Cushing’s absence to call up Cushing’s motion to reconsider the vote referring to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Meriwether’s two retrenchment army and navy bills— The house by yeas and nays 85 to 87. refused to reconsider. The remainder of the day was occupied with private Bills of which 20 were passed, and 52 house bills and 8 Senate Bills, were reported from the Committee of the whole, Tillinghast in the Chair—among the rest one for the relief of the Representatives of the Baron de Kalb to which Cave Johnson objected, but withdrew the objection— Long evening visit from Mr Rodney and Elisha H. Allen. "

Saturday—  While the house was in session yesterday, a subpoena from the United States Circuit Court now sitting in this city was brought to me at my seat, to appear before them, to testify in the case of Dr Robert Mayo, against Blair and Rives, publishers of the Globe, for a libel.— I went immediately to the City Hall and found the Court in Session. I was sworn, and testified—answering all the questions that were asked of me by the counsel of the parties— They related to the manner in which Doctor Mayo, had communicated to me his Letter to President Jackson of December 1830. and the original draught of Jacksons Letter to Fulton, Secretary of the territory of Arkansas concerning Houston’s conspiracy to dismember Mexico; and annex Texas to the United States.— The examination was short and I returned to the house before its adjournment— Mr Hassler called on me this morning, full, as usual of grievances and complaints. A select committee of 5 members of the house with Mallory at their head was appointed on the 19th. of February to overhaul his expenses and proceedings relating both to the coast survey and the weights and measures— He complains that three of the Committee, Mallory, Cushing and Aycrigg persecute him, and he says that Aycrigg’s motive is to quarter a brother of his own upon the service— He left with me two papers—one a Letter from Mallory, chairman of the Committee of 12. March last to the President communicating Resolutions of enquiry adopted by the Committee, and requesting an early answer— The other, a remonstrance by Hassler against the Limitation of the works for the Coast survey supposed to be contemplated by the Committee. At the house, the Speaker presented a Letter from Robert C. Winthrop, announcing 25. May 1842. that on account of serious illness in his family he had resigned his seat in the house and communicated the fact to the Executive of Massachusetts— His wife a most lovely woman is dying of consumption. John P. Kennedy Chairman of the Committee of Commerce, presented a long report with two bills and a joint resolution relating to commerce navigation and trade with the British Colonies—laid on the table, and ordered to be printed— Kennedy moved the printing of an extra number of copies—defeated by objection first from Hopkins and then by Cave Johnson— The house then took up private bills, and Cave Johnson wrangled against them till 3. O’Clock when upon some trivial question the house was found without a Quorum and adjourned.— In the Evening Mr Gaetano Castiglia, a political exile from Milan, brought me a Letter of Introduction from Sidney Brooks— He had been introduced to me on the floor of the house by Mr Saltonstall. He proposes to leave the city next Monday. "

I went this morning with Mrs John Adams and Mary Cutts to the Representative Hall where Mr Maffitt preached, from Philippians 3.20. [“]For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; 21. Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned, like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.” The subject was the resurrection—too capacious for the grasp and too weighty for the poise of Mr Maffitt.— The resurrection of the body, is the profoundest mystery of the Christian religion, and the most difficult article of the Christian faith— The perishable or corruptible property of matter seems to be so inseparable from it that imperishable or immortal matter is an incredible confusion of words— St. Paul pronounces the man who enquires with what body the dead shall rise, a fool—but he says too that the body that shall rise is not the same body that shall have died— He says that there is a spiritual body and a natural body.— The body that dies is vile—the body that shall rise is glorious— Behold, says the Apostle, I shew you a mystery.— And a mystery it remains and will remain, till it shall please almighty wisdom to reveal more of his eternal counsels to man— Mr Maffitt enlarged much upon the usual argument for the resurrection from analogy— The blade of grass, the blossom and the leaf—and above all the transformations of the insect tribes— He described with more minuteness than precision the metamorphosis of a grub into a butterfly which he said he had accidentally witnessed for the first time last Spring.— He gave also several of the passages from the old Testament which seem to countenance the doctrine of the resurrection, and of the immortality of the soul—particularly the passage from Job— I know that my redeemer liveth—but not the remarkable passage in the book of Ecclesiastes— Or ever the silver cord be loosened— Mr. Maffitt gave notice that divine service would be performed in the Representative hall, next Sunday morning, but not that he himself would preach— I was prevented from attending public worship this afternoon, by a very heavy thundergust which came up from 4 to 6 O’Clock, precisely at the time of meeting at St. John’s Church— I employed the time in partly redeeming the arrears in this diary occasioned by the evening at General Jesup’s—the next days dinner, and the wedding party at Sharon.

Monday—  Mr George Taylor called on me this morning to recommend the repetition of an attempt to prevail upon the house of representatives to fix a day for the consideration of the French claim bill. Mr Leavitt was here, and has furnished me with the Madisonian of last Monday— Mr Peter Force likewise came, and paid his note of 5. March last of 458:8. by Treasury Notes 450 and 17.50 in gold—allowing 1/2 of 1 per cent discount on the Treasury Notes— He has been to Charleston South Carolina, and says he went in 46. hours.— At the house an old Revolutionary Soldier and Sailor named William Willis 81 years of age—a native of Massachusetts, but now residing in Virginia came to me with a petition which he requested me to present to the house for an increase of his pension— He alledges services by Sea, in addition to those for which he receives the pension of a private soldier— I promised to present his petition—but he has no testimony.— A motion was made before I reached the house to suspend the rules for a Resolution to take a daily recess from 1. to 3 p.m. for the remainder of the Session— Lost by majority 97 to 67. less than two-thirds—but the majority will of course carry their point in a few days. Fillmore had failed also to carry a Resolution, to take the army appropriation bill out of Committee to morrow—laid on the table 100 to 75. Meriwether moved a call on the Secretary of the Navy for copies of orders to the Navy-yards since the first of this month and for the increase of workmen, at the yards since the first of January— Morgan and Proffit objected. Meriwether moved a suspension of the rules—carried 111 to 30. Previous question, and the Resolution adopted— It was Resolution day; and Fillmore called for the orders of the day—but Hopkins moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—carried 103 voting in the affirmative—given up— Underwood in the chair— Gilmer, concluded in two hours an elaborate speech for the reduction of the army—for reasons good and bad— He produced and recommended a Bill which had been sent to him ready drawn and from which he read two Sections. He was followed by Lowell of Maine in a fiery speech against any reduction of the army— Then came Meriwether with his project of retrenchment—he proposed an amendment of his own, besides the retrenchment bill which he has already reported— M’Keon closed the day’s debate with a florid retrenchment speech till past four when the Committee rose, and the house adjourned. Evening visits first from Mr and Mrs Ward, the new married couple, who are to depart next Thursday for New-York: and afterwards from Mr. Morehead one of the Senators from Kentucky, with two persons from that State, whose names I have lost, with Nathan Sargent corresponding reporter of the Philadelphia "

I have written some lines at the request of Mr Thomas Butler King, a member of the house from Georgia, for Miss Annie Low, a young Lady of whose name I never heard before; but who Mr King assures me is handsome, sensible and amiable— This morning I attended the meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs—present Adams, Granger, Meriwether, Caruthers, Granger, White and Cushing— Absent Stuart and Shepperd. Mr Caruthers had prepared in part a report upon the resolution of the house relating to the allowances claimed in the accounts of Cornelius P. Van Ness during a service of seven years from 1829 to 1836. as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Spain— Caruthers approves some of the claims, and is for disallowing others.— There are seven items of charge disallowed by the auditor of the State Department, and questioned by the Resolutions offered by Hawes to the last Congress and by Triplett to the present— The Committee agreed to allow two or three of the charges and postponed the consideration of the remainder.— In the house, Gwin of Mississippi, offered a resolution, that on Monday next and for the rest of the Session the hour of meeting of the house shall be 10. A.M. adopted— At Rayner’s motion 10000 copies of Kennedy’s colonial commerce report were ordered to be printed— I presented the petition of William Willis, which was referred to the Committee of Revolutionary claims— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Underwood in the Chair upon the army appropriation bill— M’Keon resumed his speech demagogical, rhetorical, classical, and sophistical for almost two hours— Fessenden of Maine made a very handsome speech against any reduction of the army; referring to my remarks against the increase of the army and declaring his dissent from them. It was a spirited and powerful speech— Then came a pitched battle between Black and Warren of Georgia, remarkable for the contrast of temper between faggot fire and steady flame; Ward, made a steam-engine-explosion in honour of the army, and against any reduction, till half past 4. when Halsted took the floor, the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Joseph H. Adams dined with us, and we had sundry evening visitors. We had all received invitations to an evening party at Dr Sewall’s—the hour of meeting being 9. p.m— Elizabeth had made all her arrangements to leave us to-morrow morning, and our Ladies all declined to go—but I went— It was a numerous and crowded company— Dr China Parker and his wife were there—Mrs Madison—A. Stevenson and many. I took Mr Gamble of Georgia and his daughter home on Capitol hill— "

Adams to the Railway Cars, which departed at 6 O’Clock for Baltimore; we took up her brother at his lodgings, Mrs Peyton’s— At the Cars we found Mr Seth M. Gates a member of the house from western New-York with his Sister— He is in very feeble health and since the death of Mr Lawrence has scarcely been in the house. Sollers a young member from Maryland was also in the Cars—and Thomas Pinckney whom I knew as a boy at Westminster school in 1795 and 6. now a decrepid old man, over 60. Holmes called me out from my seat two days ago to renew acquaintance with him— Mr Joseph Warren Newcomb Grandson of General Joseph Warren who fell at Bunker’s Hill called on me this morning to solicit my assistance to effect the passage of a bill in his favour reported by Mr Parmenter from the Committee of revolutionary claims—N. 435. General Warren left four children, two sons and two daughters, who by Resolutions of Congress were educated at the public expense. The claim is for seven years half pay pledged by a Resolution of 24. Augt. 1780. to the widows and children of officers dying in the service— Newcomb is the son of Mary the youngest daughter, and is the only living descendant from General Warren. Mr Ford a Messenger from the General Land Office brought me 150 dollars in Treasury Notes and 43. in a check upon the Bank of the Metropolis— Mr Van Ness came to enquire what has been done in the Committee of foreign affairs, upon Mr Triplet’s resolution concerning his accounts; upon which I told him that the Committee had not yet come to any conclusion.— At the house— The Speaker presented a Letter from Arthur Middleton late chargé d’Affaires in Spain, presenting a portrait of Columbus, the only authentic one extant— The letter and portrait were referred to the Committee on the library. This was the first of the two days specially reserved by a resolution of the house for the consideration of bills relating to the District of Columbia, and Underwood Chairman of the District brought them forward. and the spirit of chicanery was instantly at work against them— It began by defeating the passage of the bill for the relief of the district banks; crippled several others, and forced a premature adjournment, by failure of a Quorum on taking the question upon an amendment moved by Cave Johnson, introducing universal white suffrage for the election of Mayor and Councilmen the vote was 58 to 57. Call of the house refused— Adjourned.— My diary runs irresistibly into arrears; and this evening I was compelled to desist from writing by a sick and faint turn which came over me. "

Thursday  I found myself this morning restored to my usual state of health, but distracted by the multitude of occupations, newspapers and visitors.— Mr Tileston, is a manufacturer of paper at Milton and Dorchester adjoining the town of Quincy, and is here to watch the passage of the tariff bill— The manufacture of paper is one of those to which the protective duties are indispensable— They are already perishing under the operation of the compromise of 1833. and he fears that under the present prospects of a tariff there is imminent danger that his own establishment and all the other papers-mills of this Country will be swept away— I could offer him no consolation. Dr Parker came to take leave of me, being on the point of his departure for return to China. I told him that after the conversations he held with me last Summer; an enquiry was made of me, whether if an Embassy should be instituted, and the mission should be offered to me, I would accept the appointment.— I answered that if the question should be put to me from a quarter authorised to make the offer— I heard no more of that project, and all idea of carrying it into execution was abandoned— My own opinion was that such a mission was inexpedient. But it was and is my opinion that an intelligent and discreet and spirited informal commissioner ought to have been and to be there, with full power to take advantage of any incident which might occur to open a communication with the Chinese Government to sustain and promote the interests political and commercial of our country. Dr Parker said he entirely concurred in that opinion, and said he would add that he had seen the President who assured him that he had his eye fixed upon China, and would avail himself of any favourable opportunity to commence a negotiation with the celestial Empire— Lieutenant Newton of the second regiment of dragoons son of Thomas Newton of Norfolk, Virginia, brought me a letter of introduction from his father— Mr Leavitt also gave me a morning call. At the house— The day was consumed on District business.— The Alexandria Charter Bill, laid on the table by motion of W. Cost Johnson, upon a motion of mine at the 3d. reading to recommit the Bill with Instructions to strike out the word White. Sympathies of the democracy of the 5 points with the Rhode Island suffragers defeated. Revd. Mr. Fairchild of Boston here. Elliots and Kelsos—large evening party as J. J. Crittenden’s.— Mrs. Madison Lord Ashburton &c— Christopher Hughes came home with me. "

Friday  Mr Charles Fletcher is a magnificent projector— He sent me this morning a copy of a Letter he had written containing a plan for establishing a number, I think twenty missionary stations from the rocky mountains to the mouth of Columbia river, with a colonial settlement at each station. He requested my opinion of this plan, and if I approved, wished me to recommend it— He said he would call in the course of the morning for my answer, and came accordingly— I told him I had very peculiar notions about settlements beyond the rocky mountains and had become exceedingly skeptical of their expediency; especially at this time when it would be likely to lead us into a collision with Great-Britain— That however suitable his plan might be at another time, and under other circumstances, I could not recommend it now— Mr George Brown came next, and disclosed the occasion of his remaining here at Washington much longer than he had intended— He is soliciting an appointment as Consul to the South American State of Paraguay, with which he says our yankee traders have already contrived to open a lucrative and increasing commerce— He says he has almost a promise from President Tyler, of the nomination.— At the house Garrett Davis moved two Resolutions of enquiry, whether the Commission for the investigation of the affairs of the New-York custom-house still exists, and what it has cost, and from what fund the expense of it has been paid, Cushing and Proffit objected. Davis moved to suspend the rules— Cushing made a point of order that a motion to suspend the rules could be made for only one resolution at a time— The Speaker overruled him, and Davis to accommodate him reduced his two resolutions into one— Proffit called for the yeas and nays, but they were refused. the rules were suspended; and the resolution was adopted. W. B. Campbell made a second abortive attempt to suspend the rules for a joint resolution to adjourn on the 11th. of July.— There was a majority for the resolution but not two thirds 89 to 84. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Underwood in the chair upon the army Bill. Halstead and Cross made strong, and sensible speeches against any reduction of the army, and Giddings an unanswerable one for it— But he brought in the Creole Cases and then began the interruptions, the calls to order and the worryings till he was crowded down. Afternoon visit from Dr Thomas, Evening Mrs Thornton and Mrs Talbot. "

Fitzhugh in part payment of the due bills which I had received from R. I. Morsell on the 1st. of April. I enquired whether they now paid the Speaker’s checks in specie or their own bills, or in treasury Notes—they said in either at the option of the receiver— I called next at the Treasury Department, and enquired of Mr Forward, concerning the Resolution of the House calling for an exposition of the debts of the States— He called for the chief clerk Young, who said there were yet two States, Louisiana andfrom which no returns have been received— I proposed that the report should be made, with inofficial statements of the debts of the two States which have not made returns.— But Mr Forward directed Mr Young to write to the Senators from the two States and request the information from them. He said the Treasury Notes which were payable on the 3d. of April, and those which will be payable the 7th. instant shall be paid— At the house a Louisiana land-bill was by the importunity of Dawson taken from Committee of the whole and made the special order of the day for this day week— A Letter from the Secretary of War, was yesterday presented by the Speaker and read in the house declining to communicate certain documents disclosing scandalous frauds of public men in transaction, with the Cherokee Indians, called for by a Resolution of the House of 18 May moved by James Cooper, chairman of the Committee of Indian Affairs.— Cooper yesterday moved the reference of the Secretary’s Letter to that Committee and made some severe remarks upon the refusal of the documents— The house had adjourned without taking the question upon the reference, to which Cave Johnson had moved the addition of Instructions to enquire and report upon the expediency of further action of the house upon the subject— When it was called up this morning, Cushing having been absent when Cooper made his remarks yesterday requested him to repeat them which he did— Cushing then took up the cudgels for the Executive power, and stoutly defended the right of the Executive to refuse documents demanded by the house, charging usurpation upon the house for demanding them— He referred emphatically to Jefferson’s works. 4.464. as to a precedent decisive of the question. I answered him and took issue upon his principles. I referred to the message of President Washington in 1796—and the two Resolutions of the House thereon— Spencer’s Letter was referred to the Indian Committee; but without Cave Johnson’s Instructions.— Committee of the whole on the state of Union, Underwood in the Chair; in spite of Cowen’s remonstrance— Army appropriation Bill Long speech of Pope, for the reduction of the army— David Levy delegate from Florida, loquacious against it— Sputter of Cushing against Giddings for some of his animadversions upon Cushing’s belligerent propensities.

The musical band of the Marine corps have commenced their summer exercises of performing martial airs for the entertainment of the public twice a week at the going down of the Sun—on Thursdays in front of the Capitol, and on Saturdays on the grounds before the back portico of the President’s house. I went there alone after dinner last evening and heard them for about an hour before and after the setting of the Sun— The company assembled was not so numerous as usual, and I knew very few of them except the straggling members of Congress, with or without Ladies— I met there, and walked with Mr Frye— This morning I attended public worship at the Hall of the House of Representatives, where Mr Tustin was on duty; but the services were performed by the Revd. Mr Tolmage said to be President of a College in Georgia—his sermon was from 1. John 2.15. [“]Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world— If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him”— It was a discourse quite appropriate to the place in which it was delivered; and to the supposed auditory, consisting as it should, chiefly of members of Congress— This is the principle upon which the appointment of chaplains is justifiable and proper; and I consider it as one of my public duties as a representative of the people to give my attendance every Sunday morning when divine service is performed in the hall.— The preacher of this day contrasted the love of the world with the love of God—a copious but a hacknied subject; on which nothing new can be said, but upon which the same that has been repeated a thousand times may properly be repeated again— There is a long and pungent satire of Juvenal, upon the vanity and disappointments of human wishes—and the first line of the Satires of Persias—[“]O! curas hominum! O! quantum est in rebus inane” comprizes the whole system of desponding philosophy.— The philosophy of an earlier age professed by the Grecian Heraclitus— Jesus and his religion first modified and moralized it by presenting it in contrast with the love of God— Mr Tolmage’s delivery was indifferent, accompanied with a disagreeabe drawl, and yet considerably spirited— He gave out Watts’s 100th. Psalm, by the name of the 25th. hymn— The house was thin— Mr Leavitt came to me and said that his friends had recalled him, not being able to raise funds sufficient to defray his necessary expences here; and that he thought of leaving the city, next Thursday.— This afternoon I attended at St. John’s church. Mr Hawley read the Evening service for the second Sunday after Trinity, and preached from Psalm 68.18.

I was about stepping into my carriage to go to the house when two morning visitors came in; one of them from Florida, wishing to have some conversation with me concerning the state of affairs in that territory— I could not wait and appointed to morrow evening for him to call on me again— I was however so delayed; that I found the house in session, and David Levy concluding his declamation against the reduction of the army. Cowan had given notice of his intention to move a revival of the hour rule. When David had expatiated about an hour, Fillmore attempted to take the floor, but Everett and I had both taken it— Fillmore yielded it to me, and I to Everett, who spoke about a quarter of an hour, professing a very earnest desire for the reduction of the army, but declaring that he should vote against the amendments proposed to this bill, because it was not the place nor the form in which the reduction was to be effected— He said too that this reduction was recommended by the Committee on the public expenditures which had no jurisdiction in the case— The Military Committee being that which should have reported upon it.— I spoke about an hour and a half for the amendment and the reduction of the army—admitting that this was not the bill nor the form in which the good work ought to have been accomplished; but saying that I must sacrifice form to substance, and take in any form the good which I could not effect in my own way— Stanly replied to me with great power till one O’Clock when the debate was to cease— Roosevelt offered a compromise amendment to fix the army at its present numbers without further increase on reduction—lost by tellers 69 to 102— Cave Johnson’s amendment modified by mine was carried in two divisions 1. to reduce the Artillery and Infantry regiments to the standard of 1821. 102 to 64. and 2. to withhold pay after the 30th. of September next from the second Regiment of dragoons 91 to 62.— other amendments followed—the bill was reported to the house, and postponed to be printed for engrossment to-morrow— A pension appropriation Bill, and a bill to pay a militia claim of the State of Maine were passed— Afternoon visit with my wife to Mrs Newman at Mr Larneds— Numerous evening visits from the persons named above in the margin— Captain Clack dismissed from the Navy, by sentence of a Court Martial, brought copies of the proceedings of the court, with a request of my assistance to be restored to his office "

Three of the work men on the public buildings called on me again this morning to solicit my assistance to obtain an appropriation for giving them employment, by authorising the addition to the Treasury building of a wing, essentially necessary for the offices of that department— They feared that the chairman of the Committee on the public buildings was opposed to making the appropriation; and complained that their families were suffering severely—that others had left the city and were wandering about the country seeking work and bread, and several had gone to New-York where they had found it as impossible to find work as here. Meeting of the Committee of foreign affairs— Present Adams, Everett, Caruthers, White, Cushing. Meriwether—absent Stuart, Shepperd, Granger— We had only half an hour before the meeting of the house— The Committee therefore agreed to meet henceforth twice a week at 9. A.M.—and after further consideration of the accounts and claims of C. P. Van Ness—and decided upon the several contested items of the account, adjourned to meet next Friday morning, charging the chairman to arrange and assort the subjects under reference to the committee that they may be taken up and acted upon in their order. In the house, Fillmore from the Committee of Ways and Means reported a Bill to continue the existing duties of impost, till the 1st. of August next— Read twice and referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Cushing called up his motion to print 5000 extra copies of the New-York Custom-house reports, which he claimed as privileged immediately after the passage of the army appropriation bill. Garrett Davis contested this claim— The Speaker decided in Cushing’s favour but he yielded the floor for this day, for the passage of the army appropriation bill. C. J. Ingersoll, Reynolds, W. C. Johnson and D. D Barnard, all moved to recommit the bill with instructions to defeat the amendments reducing the army, but were all brought up by the previous question— The reduction of the artillery and infantry regiments to the standard of 1821 was carried by yeas and nays 113 to 84.

Mr Markoe came from the Department of State for papers, concerning our diplomatic intercourse with foreign European powers, which had been some weeks since sent to the Committee and which I now returned to him— In the house after passing over several subject first in order upon the Speaker’s table, Cushing moved to refer to the Committee of the whole on the state of the whole on the state of the Union, the Resolution reported by him from the Committee of foreign Affairs, requesting the President to institute negotiations with Great-Britain concerning our commercial relations with her American Colonies— Pickens and Fessenden discussed the question, without absolutely opposing the motion— I said a few words in support of the reference, and Lowell claimed the floor just at the expiration of the morning hour, and the house passed to the motion of Cushing to print 5000 extra copies of the New-York custom-house reports. on this motion Cushing made another elaborate speech— Underwood moved a long amendment denying the right of the President to institute an investigating commission without authority by Law—and beginning with a declaration that the house does not approve or sanction the institution of this commission— This was carried under the strangulation by the previous question of all debate, by yeas and nays 86 to 83— I then moved to lay the whole subject on the table, which had just before been refused, but was now carried by yeas and nays 96 to 76.

At the request of Mr Medill, a member of the House of Representatives, from Ohio, I wrote verses this morning for the Album of Miss Sarah Hall, of Zanesville in that State, containing a collection of autograph signatures of the members of both houses of the present Congress— In the house Nathan Appleton, introduced by Mr Saltonstall, as representative from Boston, in the place of Robert C. Winthrop resigned, was sworn by the Speaker and took his seat. There was a mis-statement in the journal, that the motion yesterday to lay the whole subject of Cushing’s motion to print extra copies of the New-York Custom-house investigation reports, on the table was made by M’Keon— It was made by me; because a majority of 3 votes had already adopted one half of a proviso encroaching upon the constitutional powers of the President: for which M’Keon had voted; and his motion was only to lay on the table the remnant of the proviso; and he merely asked whether that motion was in order— My motion was to lay on the table the whole subject, and I made it to prevent the consummation of a flagrant outrage upon the Constitution— The Speaker after some hesitation entertained my motion and it was carried by a majority of 20 votes.— I now moved to amend the journal to make it conformable to the fact; which the Speaker said should be done— Fillmore moved a Bill from the Committee of Ways and Means, for extending the present impost duties to the first of August, with a proviso, securing the distribution to the States, of the proceeds of the public Lands on the approaching first of July— The proviso being additional to the bill reported by him last Tuesday.— Cushing’s motion to refer to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union the resolution from the Committee of foreign Affairs requesting the President to enter into negotiation with the Government of Great Britain concerning our commercial intercourse with their American Colonies, was taken up after an hours speech from Lowell, the motion was carried without a division to refer the resolution.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, M’Kennan in the Chair— Fillmore’s tariff bill was taken up— Saltonstall moved to strike out the whole bill and insert the Bill reported by him from the Committee of Manufactures— After some discussion upon points of order, Fillmore in a speech of two hours opened his whole bill to debate, after which Habersham moved an amendment, to Saltonstall’s bill, and it was ordered to be printed.— After agreeing to report a small bill, concerning military land warrants the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Afternoon visit from Mr Vanbrugh Livingston.— With my wife, and Mrs John Adams I witnessed the marriage of DoctorHeiskell, a Surgeon in the army, with Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel L.

There was a large wedding party last evening at the house of Mr Samuel L Gouverneur, to witness the nuptials of his daughter with Dr Heiskell, and a much more numerous company after the ceremony was over.— President Tyler, The Secretaries of War and the Navy Spencer and Upshur, with their families—Mrs Madison, Lord Ashburton with his Secretaries, Mr Bodisco, sundry Members of both houses of Congress, Genl. Scott and several Officers of the army and navy were present at the solemnity performed by Mr Hawley—rector of St. Johns, according to the rites of the protestant episcopal church— We came home soon after ten, but the dissipation of the evening, infected this morning with idleness— Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs at 9. Present Adams Caruthers, Cushing. Everett, Granger, Shepperd, White—absent Meriwether and Alexander H. H. Stuart. The accounts of Cornelius P. Van Ness, were again taken up and further considered without final decision— Triplett’s Resolution requiring a report from the Committee on the expenses of diplomatic intercourse with foreign Nations was referred to the chairman— In the house Pendleton, and Everett attempted to introduce resolutions for abridging debate in Committee of the whole but without success— Fillmore called up out of time his second tariff extension bill, with the proviso substantially repealing the suspension of the payment of the proceeds of the public lands to the States, which is to be made for the first six months on the first day of the next Month; but will be defeated unless the condition annexed to it that the payment shall be suspended so long as an impost duty of more than 20 per cent shall be levied upon any one article of merchandize. In continuing the existing tariff till the 1st. of August, the object of this bill is to discard the restriction, without reducing any of the duties to 20 per Cent, and it roused all the antiprotective frenzy of the South against it— Underwood made a fair and candid speech avowing his ardent desire to secure the payment of the proceeds of the public Lands to the States— He said this bill would produce some curious developements, as to the opinions of the members of the house upon the tariff in embryo. And the developments immediately came. Pickens and Wise, and Cushing, and Proffit and Foster of Georgia came out like furies against the land distribution, and Gilmer took the floor— Fillmore made an abortive attempt to take the bill out of Committee— They rose twice and at half past 4 the house adjourned. Mrs. Gassaway came to enquire about the prospects of payment for the awards of the Mexican Commission— Evening scientific party at Mr Markoe’s—Poinsett, Preston, Upshur and Woodbury were there— Webster and his son Fletcher came and went— Their wives are sick— It was midnight when I came home.

Saturday  The meeting last evening at Mr Markoe’s was for the purpose of confering upon the project of connecting the organization of the National Institution for the promotion of Science with the establishment of Science. Mr Poinsett is President of the former and presided at the Meeting.— Mr Preston has introduced into the Senate a bill for combining together these two institutions, and now stated to the meeting his views on the subject: embracing an appropriation of 20000 dollars and the occupation, by Law of a large portion of the patent office building; for the preservation and arrangement of the objects of curiosity collected by the exploring expedition under Lieutenant Wilkes, now daily expected home— And he called on me to say how far my purposes may be concurrent with these suggestions— I said I had the warmest disposition to favour them, and thought there was but one difficulty in the way, which might perhaps be surmounted— I had believed that the whole burden and the whole honour of the Smithsonian institution should be exclusively confined to itself; and not entangled or commingled with any national establishment requiring appropriations of public money. I exposed the principles upon which all my movements relating to the Smithsonian bequest have been founded as well as the bills which at four successive Congresses I have reported first for obtaining the money and then for disposing of the fund— At the motion of Mr Walker of Mississippi, the President Poinsett was authorised to appoint a Committee of five members of the institute, to confer with Mr Preston and me upon the means of connecting the Smithsonian institution with the national institute— This morning I called at the Treasury Department for the warrants for repayment of treasury notes; one of which for 742 dollars I afterwards received— At the house Mr. Cushing offered a resolution calling on the President of the United States for copies of the report of the joint Commission upon the claims against Mexico, and of documents shewing the condition of the claims upon which the Commissioners did not report, which was adopted.— This day had been assigned by some leger de main of the Louisiana members for the consideration of a bill for the confirmation of certain Land-claims in the State of Louisiana,—and it consumed the day. Cave Johnson the rabid democrat, manfully resisted it, and in a speech of nearly three hours demonstrated that a great portion of the claims were rotten with fraud and corruption—but Edward D. White and Moore sustained them with ardent speeches, and Dawson the democrat silently defended the loco foco brood, and the bill was driven through with indecent precipitation in spite of Cave’s unanswerable exposure of the fraud.— The yeas and nays on the passage of the bill were 84 to 73— I went with my wife, and Mrs John Adams to two evening parties—one of Mrs John Leeds Kerr one of the Senators from Maryland, and the other a wedding party to the Gouverneur’s and the bride, by invitation of Mrs Robert Tyler at the President’s house.

The party at the President’s house last evening consisted of about 100 persons, invited by Mrs Robert Tyler Mrs Madison, with her niece Anna Payne, my family and myself, and all the remnants of President Monroe’s family— The bride, Mrs Heiskell being the only surviving grandchild of Mr Monroe— There was dancing in the now gorgeously furnished East room, and an elegant supper— The courtesies of the President and of Mrs R. Tyler to their guests were all that the most accomplished European Court could have displayed— The President led the bride into the supper table, and requested me to escort Mrs Robert Tyler— Lord Ashburton followed with Mrs Madison, and Mr Webster the Secretary of State with my wife— After supper I had a long conversation with Lord Ashburton; and went into the room, where Mr Healy is copying the full length portrait of President Washington and where the portrait of Mr Guizot painted by him is deposited. He has also the President’s daughter Alice, painted by him— It was within 5 minutes within of midnight when we came home— This morning I went alone to the Representative hall, and heard Mr Tustin preach from Romans 11.22 [“]Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God”— The first clause of the verse— Nothing can be easier than to hammer out a discourse upon this text; all human life, all history, and all holy writ is but a perpetual exemplification, infinitely diversified of the goodness, and the severity of God. Mr Tustin’s illustrations were accordingly collected from all those sources, and they might have been multiplied into a declamation of unlimited extent— As to morrow is the regular day for the receipt of resolutions, after this morning’s service was over I sat down at my table, and prepared a call upon the President for a copy of the quintuple Treaty for the suppression of the Slave trade; of Mr Cass’s protest against the ratification of it by France, and of all the correspondence, between this and the French Government on the subject.— At five this afternoon at St. John’s church I heard Mr Hawley read the Evening prayers for the 3d Sunday after Trinity and the Revd. Mr Cressy from Tennessee preached from Mark 16.16. “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned”—still the goodness and the severity of God— I remember scarcely any thing of the discourse.— We had an evening visit from Mr Carter Lee, who told us that he was preparing a new edition of his fathers memoir of the Southern campaign in our revolutionary war— As I was returning from the Capitol, I stop’d at Gadsby’s hotel, and paid a visit to Mr Abbott Lawrence who arrived yesterday as a Commissioner from Massachusetts on the Eastern boundary.

I called this morning at the Bank of the Metropolis, deposited there the Treasury Warrant for 742 dollars that I had received last Saturday and drew a check for 300 dollars in the bills of the bank, which I exchanged at C. J. Nourse’s Office for Virginia bills with 2 per cent premium— At the Treasury Department I enquired after the other warrant for 500 dollars due since the 3d. of April, of Mr Young the chief Clerk, who said he would remind the Secretary of the Treasury that it is yet to be issued— At the house Stanly presented a second self-indicatory letter of Poindexter, upon which that house took no orders not even to lay it on the table— I offered the Resolution calling on the President for copies of the quintuple treaty for the suppression of the African Slave trade of Cass’s protest against it and the correspondence with him and with France concerning it— The Resolution was adopted without opposition. Pendleton moved an addition to the 123d. rule, in substance extending the call for the previous question to debates in Committee of the whole. The motion was laid on the table, but Botts afterwards moved a reconsideration of that vote which lies over till to-morrow— Medill offered a resolution of instruction to the judiciary Committee, to report immediately a Bill to refund to Andrew Jackson the fine of 1000 dollars imposed on him by Judge Hall in 1815 with interest from that time to this— A resolution of the Ohio Legislature calling upon Congress to do this has been upwards of three months referred to the Committee on the judiciary— C. J. Ingersoll wanted to claim the floor to take to himself the blame of not having reported the bill, but the previous question silenced him, and after a refusal of the house to lay the resolution on the table, it was laid over till to morrow— Cowen of Ohio, moved the re-adoption of the one hour rule which after a call of the house and a desperate struggle against it was carried by yeas and nays 120 to 84. The amendments of the Senate to the apportionment Bill were then taken up at the motion of Horace Everett, who after a short speech moved to concur in all the Senate’s amendments, and the previous question. My indignation kindled: I intreated him to withdraw the call for the previous question; but he refused— He could not obtain a second; I moved to disagree with the Senate’s first amendment—the ratio—and to concur with the second, the representation of fractions— The debate consumed the day.— The house maintaine their own ratio by yeas and nays 112 to 95. and adjourned. Evening meeting of the National Institute for the promotion of Science— Mr Poinsett presided— Mr Preston made a splendid Speech; and President Tyler was there. "

Present Adams, Caruthers, Cushing, Everett, Granger Meriwether, Stuart, White—absent Shepperd, The Docket was taken up in order, and many of the entries were passed over, until the meeting of the house without deciding upon any one. In the house John Young of western New-York, a changeable whig, moved on further reflection, to reconsider the vote of yesterday non-concurring with the amendment of the Senate changing the ratio of the apportionment from 50179 to 70600. and after a long wrangling debate, the question of reconsideration was taken by yeas and nays and lost 106 to 108. After which I moved to concur with the second amendment of the Senate providing for the representation of fractions, by allowing one additional member for every State whose fraction will amount to more than half the standard number— Thompson of Mississippi, moved to strike out one half, and insert thirty thousand maintaining that the fraction of less than thirty thousand would conflict with the letter of the constitution— I argued that the main reason assigned by President Washington, rested avowedly on a construction of the words in the constitution, which I thought not correct; and I shewed that by allowing the representation for the fractions, with our standard there would be 11. additional members representing 558constituents, the aggregate of all the fractions, and far from bringing any member within the limit of 30000 souls would give to each member more than the standard of 50179—But W. Cost Johnson, made a warm and vehement speech against the amendment. The veto of President Washington was read; and after the rejection of Jacob Thompson’s amendment without a division, the fractional amendment itself was rejected by yeas and nays 55 to 183. The specific change of numbers connected with the alteration of the standard number, were all rejected by one motion to disagree to all of them; and then a Resolution offered by Fillmore was carried to take the temporary tariff bill out of the Committee at 2. O’Clock p.m. to-morrow and Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, M’Kennan in the chair immediately followed— Gilmer, W.

Lieutenant Wilkes, in his conversation with me last evening complained bitterly of the reception which he had met from the President of the United States and the Secretary of the Navy— He that his name had been omitted from the list of nominations for promotion in the Navy recently submitted by the President to the Senate; while the name of an Officer whom he had been obliged to send home under arrest had been included in it— That Officer, while under arrest had been permitted to present charges utterly frivolous and futile against him; and contrary to the first principles of Justice and what he believed the universal usage, those charges had been entertained— All the other Officers and men returned from the expedition returning after three years of hardships, toils and dangers had naturally expected to be welcomed home, with some cheering smile, and some kind word from the Government of their Country— They had found instead of this a cold and insulting silence.— Had this ungenerous treatment been confined to himself he would have borne it with patience; but extended as it was to all the gallant and meritorious men, and to the accomplished Officers and Artists and Men of Science, whose labours had atchieved results of which they might well be proud, it had overpowered him; and all the anxieties and cares and suffering of the whole three years were as nothing to the anguish he had endured within the last five days.— I said little in answer to him, but must wait to hear the statements of the other side.  At the house, after two or three Resolutions offered and adopted or laid over and two or three bills reported, the provisional Tariff bill, extending the collection of duties till the 1st. of August, and repealing the suspension of the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, was taken up in committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, M’Kennan an excellent chairman in the chair— The proviso was the only stumbling block between the parties and that was sharply debated by W. Cost Johnson, Pope, John W. Jones, White of Indiana, J. P. Kennedy, Arnold, and Habersham till 2. O’Clock, fixed for taking the question numerous captious amendments were then successively proposed and rejected— The question upon striking out the proviso was lost by yeas and nays 107 to 113— The bill was then ordered to be engrossed, and passed by yeas and nays 116 to 103.— Everett then called up the apportionment bill, returned from the Senate, insisting upon the amendments disagreed to by the house— Everett moved to receive and Wise moved the previous question—the house refused to recede by yeas and nays 184 to 110. W. Cost Johnson moved to adhere; but the house refused that 80 to 127. Adjourned. On coming home I found a note from Isaiah Townsend whom I visited at Fuller’s hotel. "

                "text": "16: V:30 Thursday—  Mr Townsend, brought me Letter of introduction from Ambrose Spencer of Albany in the State of New-York, warmly recommending him to attentions: he has recently returned from a tour in European Continent and in England— I had a long conversation with him last evening at his lodgings, and he called this morning, but I was engaged with Mr Hassler, who came with a new budget of complaints against the select committee appointed to examine and investigate his accounts, proceedings and expenditures in the survey of the Coast, and in the making of a full assortment of weights, and measures to be distributed throughout the States— He has been employed in these undertakings upwards of thirty years— More than once Congress have become impatient under this waste of time and money and broken him up by the denial of appropriations—but they have as repeatedly been resumed— Jackson took a fancy to him and since that time he has had his own way till Cushing took him to task last Summer— He is quite indignant at the treatment of him both by Cushing and Aycrigg.— He left some of his papers with me, but I am unable to serve him— At the house Ridgway one of the members from the State of Ohio, presented a petition that the house would rescind the resolution of censure upon Joshua R. Giddings, but the house did nothing with it— Stanly moved the appointment of a select Committee to investigate the expenditures on account of Virginia Military bounty land warrants; from which sprung a debate and Hiland Hall opened a hideous sink of corruption till he was arrested by the expiration of the morning hour. Then came a snarling party struggle, about the printing of extra copies of certain tabular tariff statements. Apportionment Bill— Garrett Davis moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday refusing to recede from the disagreement to the Senate’s amendments Thompson of Indiana moved the previous question— The reconsideration was carried by yeas and nays 101 to 97. So a vote of 110 was reconsidered by a vote of 101— Everett then moved to recede and Thompson of Indiana moved again the previous question; but a motion to adjourn, moved at once by Botts and Bowne, in the vain hope of turning the tide again to-morrow was carried— An out of door negotiation, with Southern Slave holders and Northern five points democrats has accomplished this revolution in the voting of the house, all linked together by a common hatred, envy, jealousy and fear of one man— It is an exact counterpart of the restoration of the gag rule, effected in the same manner and by the same tactics.

Mr Connell was here this morning to enquire what I proposed to do, about the bill to indemnify the claimants of sufferers by French spoliations before 1801. I said I should either move to take it up in committee of the whole on the state of the Union this day, or give notice that I shall make that motion next Saturday. I called at the Treasury Office and enquired concerning the report on the call for a statement of the amount and condition of the State debts. M’Clintock Young told me that they had not yet received returns from New-York or Louisiana— That they had written a second time to the Governor of New-York who in reply stated that he had forwarded returns; but they had never been received— Young said he believed they must answer the call to the extent of the returns which they have, the remainder to be furnished as they may come in— I told him that if the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands to the States should be made on the first of next month, I shall want tabular statements of the amount paid to each State, and of the amount retained in payment of interest on the bonds of States due to the United States— I received at last the warrant for payment of 500 dollars in Treasury Notes, due on the 3d. of April last, with interest till now 536.33. which I deposited together with a check of Speaker White for 600 dollars at the Bank of Metropolis— At the House Edward T. White by an explosion of indignant eloquence, and a suspension of the rules, introduced and drove through by a headlong impulse a bill taking away the power of holding to bail on mesne process a debtor unless upon affidavit of the debt by the creditor— He declaimed about Liberty and the natural, inalienable rights of man, as if there was not a Slave in his State or in this District— If I had said one word about Slavery I should have had the whole pack of Southern Doulocracy and Northern Servility upon me; produced merely a brawl, and been branded as a fire brand, in my own land of the pilgrims— I retired in utter disgust without the bar, and suffered this paroxism of frenzy for the rights of man, to liberate one Louisiana constituent of Edward D. White, from imprisonment for want of bail, leaving six thousand Slaves to drag their lengthened chain for life, and as inheritance for their children forever. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union M’Kennan in the chair— Tariff Bill. Habersham made an hour speech. minority and A. V. Brown an anti-tariff speech— Committee rose.

                "text": "19. V:45. Sunday—  With my wife, Mrs De Windt and Mrs John Adams, I went to the capitol, and heard the Revd Mr Edgar of Nashville Tennessee, upon Matthew 11. and 6. “And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.” Mr Edgar can hardly yet be called an elderly man— He is a handsome speaker, with a strong, clear voice a good delivery, plain piety, sound sense, and rational religion— He did not allude to the circumstances under which the words were spoken; nor attempt to explain the reason why John the Baptist, who at his first meeting with Jesus had so emphatically proclaimed him the lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, should afterwards have sent from prison to enquire of Jesus, art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? Sterne’s 36th. Sermon is upon the same text; and I thought he had accounted for this message from the baptist, as an indirect appeal to Jesus, to release him from prison by a miracle—the liberation of prisoners being from the prophesy of Isaiah 61.1.2 the special object of the mission of the Messiah— But on referring to Sterne’s Sermon, I find that although it does allude to the message from John, it does not account for it, nor mark the peculiar point of Christ’s answer, with reference to John’s own situation as prompter to the message— Mr Edgar confined himself to enumerating the causes of taking offence with the Christian religion: and with exhortation to the duty of forbearing to take such offence—his argument might have been greatly fortified by illustrations of comparison and contrast between the causes of offence in the Christian now operating upon the hearts and minds of men, and that against which the answer of Jesus admonished John to be upon his guard— I cannot pursue this disquisition— This afternoon at St. John’s church, Mr Hawley read the evening service for the fourth Sunday after Trinity; but as he ascended the pulpit to preach, the heavens darkened with a heavy thunder cloud, so that he could not see to read his manuscript, and after a few words of prayer he dismissed the congregation, but for nearly half an hour, floods of rain continued to fall and locked up the auditory within the church. As it subsided, I passed over to Mr T. B. Johnson’s house and spent a couple hours of conversation with him— I then walked home, where I found my nephew, passed midshipman Joseph H. Adams, and soon after Mr Daniel D. Barnard came in and spent the Evening with us— He urged me to attend to-morrow evening the adjourned meeting of the American institute, where Lieutenant Wilkes is to deliver an address and give an account of the four years voyage of the exploring expedition under his command recently returned— Mr Barnard is anxious to sustain Lieutenant Wilkes, against unjust persecution.

I left her there; she was going to visit the patent Office— In the house, immediately after the reading of the journal, I offered a Resolution calling upon the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the house as soon as may be practicable after the 1st. of July now impending the amount paid or credited to the several States of the Union from the proceeds of the sales of the public lands. The amount retained in payment of interest or principal of debts due from the States to the United States, and the amount due from the indebted States to the United States— My Resolution was received and adopted without opposition and without remark. T. B. King presented a petition from certain inhabitants of Alexandria praying to be receded to the State of Virginia, so that they may enjoy the right of suffrage in the election of members of Congress.— I opposed it as being a petition for the dissolution of the Union—and moved its reference to a committee of one member from each State, with instructions to report against it. King himself moved its reference to a committee of one member from each State, but a motion to lay it on the table was carried by a large majority with refusal of the yeas and nays— A message from the President was received, but not communicated by the Speaker to the house— It was in answer to the call made at my motion for copies of the quintuple Treaty, of Cass’s protest and all the correspondence concerning it. He says that no copy has been officially communicated to this Government, and that he therefore cannot send an authentic copy, and he declines sending the other papers, believing it incompatible with the public interest.

Mr Burnell is to present it to the house, and Mr Whitney requests my influence in his behalf— Dr and Mrs Baldwin were occasional visitors; but the Doctor has a claim against Mexico, and a Memorial to Congress, concerning it, which invokes sympathy, to which my feeling responds more freely than my reason— In the house this day, Casey made a thrust to drive through a land pre-emption plunder bill, partly but not wholly successful— Goggin scolded his hour at Hiland Hall, for exposing the frauds of Virginia Military Land-warrants, and W. O. Goode took the floor to follow him— In Committee of the whole on the state of the Union M’Kennan in the chair, Pickens spouted for his hour antitariff statistics against the tariff-bill— Snyder of Pennsylvania ditto and by way of originality exhibited a pair of coarse worsted socks of home manufactures The members one by one stole away from their Seats— The debate languished— Smith of Virginia, extra billy took the floor but was not ready.

Kennedy took the floor and the Committee rose— Fillmore gave notice that he should move to-morrow to take up the Senate’s amendments to the Navy-appropriation Bill, and the house after 4 adjourned— Mr Horsley Palmer had visited at my house, and left a Letter of introduction from C. A. Davis of New-York. Mr Mitchell of Cincinnati sent to my seat for me and asked me for a Letter of introduction to the Astronomer royal, and I complied with his request. I had evening visits from Mr Hiland Hall with a Mr Hays, a native of this Country, domiciled in the Island of Barbadoes, and now a transient visitor to his native land— This morning, I called at the Office of the Commissioner of Pensions, and left with him a document in support of a widow’s pension claim. Then at the Navy Department after waiting a full half hour for David Levy the Delegate from Florida to close his interview with the Secretary, I succeeded him in the Office— I made some enquiries about the amendments of the Senate to the Navy Appropriation bill, which neither he nor I could understand it— Upon another half hour’s conversation with him, I found it would be necessary for me to pursue my own course upon the bill, without regard to his opinions— I came to the house and found Barker Burnell, inveighing agains the reduction of the appropriations, after which Charles J. Ingersoll delivered his hour talk for and against the appropriation and the Navy. Meriwether who followed him said he had argued both sides of the question so well, that he had left him in doubt on which side he would vote. Meriwether himself pressed his retrenchment reductions with great vigour and vehemence— He attacked the Secretary with great severity for the errors in his estimates; he commented also with indignation upon the speeches of Buchanan and Bayard in the Senate censuring the conduct of the house of representatives— Sprigg came next with a wild rhapsody for reducing the expenditures and against the Navy— I spoke about half an hour against agreeing to the Senate’s amendment reducing the item of appropriation for pay, and also against their amendment sanctioning the appointment of Navy Officers till the close of the present Session; and providing that hereafter Midshipmen shall be appointed from the several States, Territories and District, according to federal numbers in the service—and I adduced proofs from public documents, positive proofs of extreme disproportions in the appointments of naval officers, in favour of the States of Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, and against Massachusetts. M’Clellan of Kinderhoek, Mark A. Cooper followed—then Fillmore—Charles Brown took the floor. Committee rose— Adjourned— Evening visit from Nathan Appleton. "

St. John’s day. 28th. anniversary of my arrival at Ghent— Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs— Present Adams, Stuart, White, Granger, Meriwether.— A bare quorum— Absent Cushing, Everett, Caruthers and Shepperd— The Message of the President referred to the Committee on Wednesday was at the printer’s. They sent from the Clerk’s Office to the printing Office for it; but when it came the Committee had adjourned and the house was in session— The Committee did nothing. In the house the Resolution of enquiry by a select Committee about the appropriations for the allowance of Virginia Military Land warrants, W. O. Goode followed the Virginia pack against Hall— James Cooper moved the previous question, but withdrew it at the request of Hall to give him the opportunity to reply to the Virginia vituperations— Fillmore moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, but Cowen claimed the day for private business, and the house sustained him— There were 52 private bills engrossed for a third reading, which were read by their titles and passed.— A bill for the relief of Hugh Stewart, was rejected by yeas and nays 70 to 78— I voted against it because on hearing the report read I saw no sufficient proof in it of the justice of the claim— Samuel S. Bowne of Cooperstown Otsego, New-York voted against it, and immediately after moved a reconsideration of the vote. A practice very common in the house, but which I deem neither fair nor honest— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. John C. Clark, of Bainbridge, Chenango New-York, in the Chair— Two or three cases were taken up and passed to be reported without examination or enquiry; a bill purporting to be for the relief of James C. Watson of the State of Georgia, filthy with the stench of slave-trade abomination was passing with the same silent connivence of the servile North— Giddings had spoken to me of the abomination of this bill; but Giddings was now not in his seat—nor was Slade in his—in three minutes the bill would have been repoted to the house without amendment, and passed through, by the screw of the previous question— I rose and moved to strike out the enacting clause of the bill—and Mark A. Cooper blazed out for the slave trade— Caruthers had reported Bill with a report, and said he could satisfy me in a very few words with the justice of the claim— The chairman said if the Bill was to be debated, it must lie over and direct the clerk to take up the next. Cooper, sputtered, and blustered, and rioted till he declared he would object to every bill called up until my objection to the Bill for the relief of Watson the result of which was that Cooper disgraced himself in the face of the world, but I have no time or space here to tell how— Mrs De Wint and Emily left us. I dined with Lord Ashburton, and the Commissioners. "

                "text": "25. VI. Saturday  Dr Mayo called on me yesterday morning just as I was going out to the capitol, and asked me if I could let him have the Letter which he wrote me early in 1838. when he furnished me copies of his Letter to President Jackson of 2. Decr 1830. and of that of 10. Decr. 1830. from Jackson to W. Fulton then Secretary of the Territory of Arkansas— I told him that if I had received from him such a Letter, of which my recollection was indistinct it must be on my files of Letters of the year 1838 which were at Quincy. That of course I could not furnish the Letter now, but on my return to Quincy, I expected I could find it, in which case it should be at his service— The verdict of the jury in the Doctor’s suit for a libel against Blair and Rives editors of the globe, was against him— He says that his Counsel Mr Coxe, will move the Court for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was against Law and evidence, and has no doubt that he will succeed— He intimated that the affidavit of James D. Westcott in 1830, Secretary in the Territory of Florida and himself an enormous speculation in Texas adventure had operated much against him before the jury, and he left a copy of it with me— Mr Westcott says he was perfectly well acquainted with Houston’s projects in 1829, for the emancipation of Texas and largely shared in them but that he never received from President Jackson such a Letter as that to Fulton— This morning I called at the Treasury Department to enquire for the report on the call for a return of State debts— I met M’Clintock Young in the entry on the lower floor, who told me that the report had been sent to the house— I went immediately to the Capitol for a day of business so diversified multiplied and important that I can make no record of it. My call on the Secretary of the Navy for returns of native Seamen by States, had been left last Evening under the previous question, and a forced adjournment for want of a Quorum— But there were five or six other fragments of unfinished business to be taken up in turn— And I had last week given notice that I should move this day to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the French claim bill— I got the floor by moving an amendment of the Journal, which was clear and made without opposition; and while up, referring to my notice given I moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up my french claim bill: but I had numerous competitors for the floor— Mark A. Cooper and Black consumed an hour and a half, to bully and browbeat the house to rescind the record of Cooper’s disgrace on the journal— Hiland Hall took the morning hour to flay T. W. Gilmer on the Virginia Military Land Warrants— The struggle for the floor was continued through a great part of the day: Several bills at their third reading were passed without opposition— Two reports from the Secretary of the Treasury, were presented by the Speaker—one of them the answer to the call of the house of last Summer for a return of the State debts, which at my motion was ordered to be laid on the table and printed— By dint of importunities I obtained the adoption of my resolution offered yesterday, calling on the Secretary of the Navy for returns of native and naturalized Seamen by States—to which Cave John succeeded in adding an amendment concerning the cost of Ships. Filmore moved a suspension of the rules to take up the amendments of the Senate to the temporary tariff—he failed by a vote of 127 to 66. not quite two thirds. The bill was nevertheless soon after taken up—the previous question called and carried on the amendments of the Senate, containing the suspension of the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands to the States, from the first of July to the first of August—this surrender of all the proceeds of the public lands, and was perpetrated by a whig vote of 104 to 96. Bowne’s motion to reconsider the vote rejecting the bill for the relief of Hugh Stewart was carried 95 to 43. and the bill was passed 87 to 69. I voted for the reconsideration and for the bill upon explanation made to me this morning by Mr Nye. I moved so often to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, that I finally succeeded by tellers 62 to 60.— Kennedy had the floor on his report and bill from the Committee of Commerce; but yielded it to me, and I moved to take up the French claim bill. Carried by Tellers 72 to 70. Dixon H Lewis instantly moved the committee to rise—lost by tellers 66 to 79— At last the Clerk read the bill through; and I then made an exposition of claim, and had read by the Clerk B. Howard’s report as Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs in March 1838. I moved the Committee to rise and report the Bill—but Arnold made a heated speech against the Bill, Tillinghast a short one in its favour and Hunter moved the Committee to rise, for the chance of another day to pour out his volley against it and the Committee rose. John Tyler junr delivered to the Speaker a message from the President of the United States announcing to the house that he had approved and signed the apportionment bill; and had sent with the Bill to the Department of State, his reasons for signing it— I moved that the message be referred to a select Committee with power to send for persons and papers— I gave my reasons for this motion which were answered with great violence by Wise. Adjourned after 5. O’Clock— Walk and heard the music in the President’s grounds— Evening visit from Lieutenant Hudson. "

                "text": "26. V:30. Sunday  I went alone this morning, to public worship at the hall of the house of Representatives. Mr Tustin preached from Luke 23.43. “And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day, though shalt be with me, in paradise.” There are various points of view under which this text may be and has been considered. One of them upon the dangers of death bed repentance; upon which I twice heard a discourse of great power from the late D, M’Cormick which I always suspected to be of other than his composition— Mr Tustin dwelt upon the exemplification in this instance of the unbounded power of repentance; he marked the apparent difference between the narratives of Matthew which charges both the malefactors with reviling Jesus and Luke which represents one of them as penitent, and thereby securing the instantaneous and free pardon of all his sins.— He supposes to reconcile the two Stories together that the repentance was instantaneous, and after the nailing of the malefactors to their crosses— In the course of the services Mr Tustin alluded to the unusual number of deaths among the members of the present Congress, and distinctly intimated that there was now another added to the list. William Parmenter who sat in the seat behind me informed me after the services were over, that the deceased was our colleague William Soden Hastings of the 9th. congressional district— He died on the 17th. instt. at the red Sulphur Springs in Virginia. Mr Parmenter mentioned and Briggs confirmed that it was proposed to hold a meeting of the Massachusetts delegation at the Committee room of the Committee of the House on Post-Offices and Post roads at 9 O’Clock tomorrow morning; which I promised to attend. After church I called at Gadsby’s hotel and enquired whither Mr Abbott Lawrence was gone? they told me to Major Turnbull’s— Thither I went, and there I found him— He has been unwell, but is now better— He gave me a general idea of the state of the negotiation, which is not very promising. But he says he has had confidential conversations with Lord Ashburton; and finds him fair and candid— After dinner at St John’s church Mr Hawley read prayers for the 5th. Sunday after Trinity, and a stranger preached from Luke 16.25. [“]But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy life-time received it thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.” A sensible well written and judicious discourse upon the parable of Lazarus.— After church I called at Fuller’s to see Mr Horsley Palmer who had brought me a Letter from Charles A. Davis of New-York, but he was out I paid an evening visit to Mrs Madison, and on returning home found Messrs. Kavenagh, Kent and Otis, Commissioners from Maine at my house— Mr Preble and the others had been here. "

Met the members of the Massachusetts delegation in both houses of Congress, in the Committee room of the Committee on Post-Offices and Post roads of the house. I nominated Isaac C. Bates as Chairman and he was chosen. Choate was also present; and Baker, Borden, Briggs, Hudson and Parmenter whom I had taken up in the Pennsylvania avenue Burnell was also there; but neither Appleton, Calhoun Cushing nor Saltonstall was there— A motion was made, and it was voted that I should announce Mr Hastings’s decease to the House— While we were there Mr Yorke of the New-Jersey delegation in the house, came in and delivered to me a note from Mr Maxwell informed me of the death of Samuel L. Southard late President of the Senate; he died yesterday morning at Fredericsburg, Virginia; and requesting me to announce the event to the house, or to follow the member from the state who shall announce it— After some consultation it was agreed that the death of Mr Hastings should be announced in the house, and that of Mr Southard in the Senate, this day; but that the latter should not be communicated to the house till to-morrow; when the funeral is to take place. Accordingly as soon as the journal had been read, I rose and announced the death of William Soden Hastings, a member of the house from the 9th. Congressional district of Massachusetts; and after a short address to the house upon his character I moved the usual Resolutions, of the deep sensibility of the house at the decease of Mr Hastings, and that the members will wear crape 30 days, which were unanimously adopted— Also, that the Speaker inform the Governor of Massachusetts of the vacancy in the delegation from that State; and then that the house do adjourn. I remained in the house till 2 O’Clock, and then called and left cards for Messrs. Appleton and Saltonstall at their lodgings, and at Gadsby’s hotel to see the four Commissioners from the State of Maine, but only saw Mr Abbott Lawrence and Charles Allen and John Mills, the Commissioners from Massachusetts. Towards evening Mr Surault teacher of French came looking out for employment, and Mr Hassler to take back some of his papers, and again bitterly to complain of the treatment of him by Aycrigg and Cushing— At 8 O’Clock I attended at the adjourned meeting of the National Institute at the Patent Office building, where Lieutenant Wilkes completed his narrative of the exploring expedition— Found Dr and Mrs Baldwin here when I came home— "

V:15 Tuesday  Mr Minot is an Inspector of the Customs by the appointment of the collector at Salem, but is an inhabitant of the village of Neponsett, and claims to be one of my constituents, without knowing it; for he thought Neponsett was in the adjoining district, represented by the late W. S. Hastings— He is an everlasting talker, and so full of self-satisfaction with his talent at detecting smugglers that it does one good to witness his happiness— But although I informed him of the necessity I was under of reaching the Capitol by 9. O’Clock, his streams of oratory delayed me for half an hour beyond that time— I found only four members of the Committee at our chamber, Stuart, Caruthers, Shepperd and White, and by my arrival we barely formed a quorum— Absent, Cushing, Everett, Granger, and Meriwether— Two Messages from the President referred to the Committee were yet at the printers— A Fresh Letter from C. P. Van Ness with additional documents relating to his accounts was read, and the Committee adjourned to Friday. In the House, immediately after the reading of the journal, the Secretary of the Senate Asbury Dickins came in, with two messages—one communicating a resolution honorary to the memory of William S. Hastings, adopted on receiving from the House the message announcing his decease,—and the other communicating to the house the decease of Samuel L. Southard late a Senator from the State of New-Jersey and inviting the house to attend his funeral this day from the Senate chamber—at 11. O’Clock— John P. V. Maxwell, then rose and delivered a funereal eulogy upon Mr Southard; closing with a direct appeal to me and moving the honorary resolutions one of which was that the house would attend the funeral— I seconded the motion, and responded to the appeal of Mr Maxwell, by pronouncing a brief panegyric upon Mr Southard, which he had well deserved at my hands— The house adjourned, and I followed with Mr Granger, immediately after the Speaker and Clerk, in the procession to the Senate chamber, where the impressive funeral solemnities were performed by Mr Tustin, the chaplain of the Senate. Mr Maffitt the chaplain to the house was not present. Mr Tustin made a long prayer—read the 15th. chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians and preached a discourse of nearly an hour upon John 14.1. [“]Let not your heart be troubled” The corpse was not brought into the Senate chamber. In the procession of carriages to the grave yard, I went with the Speaker and clerk and Mr Appleton. We returned to the Capitol, and left the Speaker and Clerk there— I left Mr Appleton at his lodgings and came home— The President and his Cabinet were at the Senate chamber, but did not go to the grave— My address to the house this day was less pleasing than that of yesterday— Lieutt.

The melancholy duties of the last two days have been succeeded by others equally distressing of another character— The thermometer is up to 90, and I can scarcely move one foot before another.— At the house after the usual number of creeping in resolutions about Post roads and land claims Proffit offered three resolutions of enquiry about dismissed officers handing over public monies which were adopted— I called up my resolution for the appointment of a select committee upon the masked veto message— I had some difficulty in getting it up; and foreseeing, that my right to speak to it a second time, I offered a modification of it, that the Committee should consist of five members— Landaff W. Andrews who had the floor yielded it to me— Objection was made to my speaking a second time, but the Speaker said that the resolution having been modified since I spoke, it was no longer to the same question.— So indispensable is small management in this great assembly. But for this little artifice I should surely have been silenced— I spoke a full hour, and brought out all my objections to the masked veto— When I finished Landaff W. Andrews moved the previous question— Seconded 75 to 72. Proffit moved the yeas and nays on the question, shall the main question be now put—Yeas and nays 107 to 97. Boyd moved to lay the whole subject on the table—yeas and nays 91 to 107. I proposed then to modify the resolution by striking out the power to send for persons and papers; but this was objected to: I therefore required and M’Kay moved to divide the question.— The reference was carried without division, and the power to send for person and papers was rejected.— The Indian appropriation bill was then taken up— M’Kay made a feeble demonstration of enormous abuses and Gwinn moved a new section but the previous question swept off all else, and the bill was passed. John Tyler junr. brought in a Message from the President returning the little Tariff bill with his objetions to its passage, which produced a burst of indignation from Granger and Fillmore—of exultation from Holmes; of Jesuitism and double dealing from . . . . Cushing replied to with spirit and vivacity by Saltonstall— Briggs took the floor—and at 5 the house adjourned— Mr Belcher paid me an ing visit— He had lent me a Chinese map of China. "

At the house this morning, Fillmore offered a Resolution of enquiry of the Secretary of the Treasury, whether he has changed his opinion since he reported to the house that it might well be doubted whether without further legislation by Congress, any impost duties can be collected after this day; and if so what has caused the change. Adopted without opposition. John M’Keon came to my seat with a Resolution which he was about to offer directing the Committee of Naval Affairs to enquire into the expediency of testifying in some manner the high sense entertained by this house of the merits and services of the officers and men employed in the late exploring expedition— I advised him to insert the name of Lieutenant Charles Wilkes the commander, which he did. But Mallory of Norfolk objected to the Resolution as untimely— He was for waiting to know what had been the results of the expedition— Ay—said M’Keon— Wilkes is not a Virginian— M’Keon’s resolution was not received. John P. Weller, the rankest 5 points democrat in the house volunteered to be the new Tyler financier, and first asked the unanimous consent of the house, and then moved a suspension of the rules, and called for the yeas and nays to enable him to introduce a bill, to be carried through both houses of Congress and signed by the President this day, to continue all the tariff Laws, as they existed on the first of this month, until further Legislation by Congress— Bowne moved a Call of the house— Cushing called the yeas and nays on this motion and they were taken 89 to 80— The house was called—202 members answered to their names. Weller modified his bill, limiting it to the 3d. of next March instead of till further legislation by Congress and adding to existing laws the words in actual operation— James Cooper moved to lay Weller’s motion to suspend the rules, on the table but at Everett’s request withdrew his motion— The vote by yeas and nays to suspend the rules was 96 to 106. not even a majority— Roosevelt immediately moved again to suspend the rules to enable him to introduce a bill, authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations for the appraisement of imported goods, ad libitum under the direction of the President— Yeas and nays on Roosevelt’s motion to suspend the Rules 91 to 113.— Then the debate on the little tariff veto was resumed. Briggs, A. H. H. Stuart Tillinghast, Proffit, Lane of Indiana and Weller kept it up till 5. O’Clock. Caruthers took the floor. Committee rose—and house adjourned. We had a numerous party of evening visitors as per margin— Fahrenheit has been these last two days down to 90.— I saw in the house this day Isaac Southard and his Son. "

Wednesday  Committee of foreign affairs— Present Adams, Stuart, White, Granger, Everett, Shepperd, Caruthers— Absent Cushing and Meriwether— Two Messages were referred to the Committee 1. on the 21st. of June, declining to communicate copies of the quintuple Treaty, Cass’s Protest and the correspondence relating thereto— 2. 24 June, with the proposal to establish a line of Steam packets between Havre and New-York at the joint expense of the Governments of the United States and of France— The first only was taken up and discussed— I stated my reason for offering the Resolution call, and my opinion that the answer of the Message was not satisfactory.— Difference of opinion with regard to the relative rights of the House and of the Executive appeared.— After some discussion Mr. Everett against which, drew up and offered a Resolution against which he said it was not improbable that he should himself vote— The Committee had not time to consider it—nor to take up the message relating to a line of Steam-packets between New-York and Havre.— In the house Fillmore, from the Committee of Ways and Means reported the army appropriation bill, with the Senate’s amendments, and amendments thereto—referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and ordered to be printed— Pendleton reported a Bill for payment of Florida militia— Casey of Illinois moved a joint Resolution to adjourn on Monday the 18th. of this Month— Objection made— Casey moves to suspend the rules— Call of the house refused— Suspension refused by yeas and nays—75 to 80— The veto message to the little Tariff bill was now taken up, the question being whether the bill shall pass notwithstanding the objections of the President— Every body knows that it will not pass even the house. All debate upon it therefore with reference to the action of the house, is waste of time—but the reasons of the President, and the President himself are canvassed with great bitterness— Caruthers had the floor this morning— A man of placid temper, courteous manners, and mild deportment— A steady southern Slave-holding whig. He exposed the futility of the President’s reasons for objecting to the bill, and got into the muddy stream of Tennessee politics which called up Gentry Turney, Christopher H. Williams and W. B. Campbell— Rhett, Summers, Barnard, and Joseph L. White, followed, each for an hour. William Smith of Virginia, the competitor and successor of the late ill-star’d Linn Banks took the floor—the Committee rose and the house adjourned— The heat, insupportable— I was occupied amidst the din and bustle of the day in preparing a report for the select committee on the Message, about the Presidents exposition of reasons for approving and signing the apportionment Bill— The Committee are Adams, Pope, M’Kennon, Hunter and Proffit.

Met at 9 this morning the select committee on the President’s Message, informing the House of Representatives that he had caused to be deposited in the Office of the Secretary of State, an exposition of his reasons for giving his sanction to the apportionment Act— Present Adams, M’Kennon, Hunter and Proffit— Mr Pope did not attend. I presented a Resolution, which I proposed the Chairman of the Committee should be directed to offer to the house, calling upon the Secretary of State to bring or transmit to the house of the exposition of the reasons for his approving and signing the apportionment act, deposited in the office of the Secretary of State, accompanying the Bill— There was little debate on the subject in committee— Proffit said he would prefer asking for a copy—voted against the Resolution, and asked if I should have any objection to a counter minority report— I said, certainly not— I reserved my own unfinished report till the purport of Mr Tyler’s reasons shall have been ascertained— In the house immediately after the reading of the journal, and two or three other intrusions, I presented the Resolution as directed by the Committee; which was opposed first by Proffit, who doubted the power of this house to send to a public department for an original paper or document, and then by Cushing who maintained that the house had no right to send for an original paper to a public department in its judicial capacity.— Charles J. Ingersoll enquired what was the object of the committee in proposing to send for the paper— I answered that the house might know what the paper was, and what it contained.— He said he should then vote for the Resolution, and with some other remarks did so— I called for the yeas and nays on Cushing’s amendment, which was carried 94 to 80. a close party vote of 80 democrats 6 of the guard and 8 whig deserters— The resolution was then adopted without a division.— Joseph L. White had in his speech yesterday charged Calvary Morris one of the deserters from the whig ranks to the guard, with frequent absence at the calls of yeas and nays during the Session. Morris asked this day to make an explanation— That he had been disabled by painful and dangerous cramps in his stomach—whereupon White said that if he had known that he would not have made the charge, and he withdrew it. The temporary tariff veto bill then came up— William Smith rattled his hour in honor of the compromise and the veto and baited granger into a catechism, of question and answer, which Granger would have done better to treat with scornful Silence— Payne of Alabama, Watterson, Howard, Arnold, Wise, and Underwood followed, each an hour till near six O’Clock—when Tillinghast moved to adjourn over to Tuesday— The yeas and nays were called; I voted no—two or three others did the same. Tillinghast withdrew his motion and the house adjourned— After dinner I walked in the President’s grounds to hear the music of the marine corps band— Met there Mr Storer the Clergyman from Portland, returning from a visit to the State of Mississippi— Great perplexity for divine counsel.

                "text": "3. V. Sunday  I attended public worship this morning, in that hall of the house of representatives— Mr Tustin made the prayer and sung the hymn— A stranger, young theologian preached from what he called the Letter of St. Paul to the Hebrews 10.9. “Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.”— There is much of the obscurity in this text, charged upon the writings of St. Paul—though it is not entirely clear that this epistle was written by him— It does not like all the rest of Paul’s epistles, begin by announcing the writer in his own name, and does not after the manner of Paul devote much of the Epistle to himself and his own concerns— It begins by declaring in the most emphatic manner Jesus Christ infinitely above not only all preceding prophets but even all the angels in heaven. Only Son of God— God himself by inheritance, and by whom God made the worlds. And upon this foundation is raised the argument that Christianity has superseded the Levitical law—that the crucifixion of Jesus, by one sacrifice of blood, made an atonement for the sins of all mankind past, present and to come, and abolished all other expiatory sacrifices of Bulls and goats, and sheep and pigeons, which the Mosaic law required to be continually repeated, and of which the apostle says, it is not possible that they should take away sins— Our preacher gave us a small dose of the usual galimatias about the atonement, and an abridge narrative of the crucifixion. There were certainly not one hundred auditors present.— After the hall was cleared out Mr Leavitt, and Mr Gentry severally came to my seat to converse with me— Mr Leavitt soon withdrew, and Gentry most earnestly entreated me to make a speech to-morrow on the monthly tariff veto— and he urged me specially to make it to-morrow— I have had so many applications to the same effect, that I can no longer resist, and must commit my cause to Heaven, with a supplication that nothing may pass my lips injurious to the cause itself or unworthy of me— When I came home I found Mr Abbott Lawrence at my house. I enquired of him the state of the negotiation— He said not so promising as he could wish— They had received a projet from Lord Ashburton respecting the Northeastern boundary—they had sent him through the Secretary in return their projet— But the Commissioners from Maine were tenacious upon trifles— Lord Ashburton was tenacious upon trifles—much more so than he had appeared to be when he first came.— He had recently received instructions from home, and had intimated that they tied him up, far beyond those he had brought with him; and even that if they had prescribed to him before he left home, he would not have accepted the mission— Clouds are thickening around us— Mr Lawrence said he would see me again, shortly. And he too urged me warmly to make a speech on the Tariff-bill veto— I was again this afternoon detained from church by a heavy thunder-gust which came up precisely at the time of meeting, and spent the Evening in making hasty minutes for a speech to-morrow.

Mr Mercer, a son of the Revolutionary Officer killed at Princeton 1777. called on me this morning— He resides somewhere in Virginia, and told me that he had been introduced to my father when Vice President of the United States at Philadelphia in 1796.— He had much conversation and declared his approbation of my course in Congress— His visit detained me so that on reaching the house I found Robert M. T. Hunter, fretting out his hour speech in support of the little tariff veto, and in personal justification of the President. When he finished James Cooper of Pennsylvania took the floor— William Cost Johnson urged him to yield for a motion to adjourn— Cooper declined, and spoke an hour against the President and the veto— Romulus M. Saunders followed in a violent invective against the whig, which includes the whole compass of his conceptions. There is not a more cankered or venomous reptile in the country— Thomas F. Marshall of Kentucky, came next, with a splendid hour speech against the veto, enlarging into more general considerations, embracing the State debts and the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands— I had risen to take the floor several times without success and felt very aukward and reluctant to take it while the impression of Marshall’s speech was bearing so heavily upon the house— I took it nevertheless, and began by a compliment to Marshall which disarmed him of his resentment so that immediately after I finished he came and offered me his hand— Of the hasty minutes which I had noted last evening I followed the course of about one quarter part through and was cut off from my argument just as I began to examine the veto message— The previous question was immediately afterwards moved and after much struggling was carried— Cushing whom I had somewhat annoyed by exposing his unconstitutional doctrines was excessively anxious to reply— W. C. Johnson and Sprigg asked to be excused from voting, for the purpose of making short speeches and then withdrew their motions. Sprigg reared up and kick’d up his hind heels like a rampart colt— The vote upon the bill was 114 to 97. Not two thirds, and of course was lost— The report of the Secretary of State, with a copy of the President’s reasons for signing the apportionment Bill, was presented by the Speaker to the House— I moved that it should be printed, and referred to the select Committee— But John Campbell was gravid with a speech and an adjournment was moved and carried— Visit from George Brown— Evening with the Ladies at Dr Thomas’s. Saw and heard a few Sky-rockets. Mrs Roosevelt promised to send me her Album. "

The Resolution offered last Friday by Everett, was a call without qualification upon the President for copies of Cass’s protest against the ratification by France of the Quintuple Treaty But Everett himself in offering it doubted whether he would vote for it; and cannot settle in his own mind, whether the intercourse between the House and the President with regard to calls for papers is matter of courtesy; or of right. Cushing pretended that the house had no more right to call upon the President, than the President had to call upon the house— I gave my opinions of the right of the house to make a peremptory call, without reserve; but the other members of the Committee seemed afraid to speak their minds on the subject, which was postponed for further consideration, as was the other proposed project for a lure of Steampackets between Havre and New-York at the joint expence of the Governments of the United States and of France— At the house after two or three reports of Committees, and as many petitions, one of which was presented by Mr Botts, for a protective tariff from 2000 inhabitants of Richmond Virginia at which he declared his delight—the morning hour was given to Mr Thomas W. Gilmer for his personal explanation under the merciless scourge of Hiland Hall— He spoke with lordly but blushing contempt of the paltry pittance of one percent commission of one percent upon whatever might be recovered upon the Virginia Military Land-warrant claims—but his tone towards Hall was changed from over bearing insolence to humble courtesy— The Resolution for the appointment of a select investigating committee of the Virginia Military bounty Land-warrants was then adopted with the proposed amendments, and Fillmore moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the general Tariff bill— I pleaded for a decision on my motion to print and refer to the select Committee the Report from the Secretary of State with the copy of the exposition of the President’s reasons for signing the Apportionment Bill; but John Campbell insisted on making a speech, and the house would not wait to hear him— They went into Committee, M’Kennan in the chair— John P. Kennedy, Nathan Appleton, Romulus M. Saunders, Bidlack, M’Keon and Joseph R. Ingersoll successively debated the Bill till S. Triplett took the floor, and the house adjourned. Fillmore gave notice that he would to-morrow move two Resolutions to limit the time of debate on this bill— Ingersoll’s speak was beautiful—classical eloquent— Kennedy’s ingenious and cogent— Appleton’s concise and curious. Isaiah Townsend paid me an evening visit. "

Wednesday  Mr Foster is one of the Armourers employed at the U.S. Armoury at Springfield, Massachusetts, and was sent here as a delegate from the body of those workmen to remonstrate against the change in the management of that institution from a civil to a military superintendence, made in the course of the last year.— A commission was instituted by the Secretary of War to examine the condition of the establishment, and made an unfavourable report which was communicated to me last November in manuscript at Boston, and is now printed. Executive Document N. 207. of the present Congress and Session— Mr Foster had a copy of it with him, and complained that it was partial and unjust— That the examination was clandestine and unfair, and that Daniel Tyler the chief reporter was interested in a private manufactury of arms in hostile competition with that of the public— Some weeks since there was here a deputation from the inhabitants of Springfield to remonstrate against the change from a civil to a military superintendency who called one morning on me— The subject is now under consideration in the Senate— I called this morning at the Bank of the Metropolis— Then at the Treasury Department, where Mr Young informed me that the report upon the Resolution calling for the amount due to the several States on the first of this month, was nearly ready and would very soon be made, with the returns from the States of Louisiana and New-York, of the amount of their debts, which had been so long waited for, and have at length been received.— At the house, after the stopping at Charles Nourse’s office I came in just in time to demand the decision of the house upon my motion to print and refer to the select committee the report from the Secretary of State with the President’s Exposition of his reasons for signing the apportionment Bill— Cushing started up and said Mr Campbell, had declared his intention to speak on this question— Cushing’s object was to stave off the question— I said if Campbell wished to speak he should be here. Cushing said he would then take the floor himself, which he did, though Campbell in the meantime came in. The question to print was first taken and carried: and then Cushing spoke near an hour, upon the Legislative power of the President. He was followed by Campbell for nearly another hour— Botts then moved the previous question, in which I acquiesced, and the reference was carried without opposition.— Fillmore offered his resolution to take the Tariff Bill out of Committee next Monday, which was amended to Tuesday, and carried by yeas and nays, 98 to 94.— But he could not obtain a suspension of the rules to offer the resolution to cease general debate on the Tariff bill, and take up the details on Friday next— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, M’Kennan in the chair on the Tariff Bill—Triplett—Washington, Barnard, and Mark A. Cooper spoke each for his hour— John T. Mason took the floor— The Committee rose for lack of a quorum and the house adjourned after 5.

                "text": "7. V. Thursday  Mr Jesse Murdock of Carver one of the towns of the 12th. Congressional District of Massachusetts, called on me this morning with a recommendatory Letter from Mr. Nathaniel M. Davis of Plymouth. Mr Murdock has been many years a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts and was Postmaster at Carver from 1832. to 1839. when he was removed by Amos Kendall, and a politician named Ward appointed in his place— He has now a petition from inhabitants of Carver for his restoration; but his main anxiety is to prevent the removal of the Post-office from its present location, which the present officer will soon be obliged to do. I went with Mr Murdock, and presented him to the Postmaster general, with a strong recommendation, and a statement of the grounds of his application— I then left them and came to the House, and found John Thompson Mason in superlatively dull discourse against the tariff bill.— Charles J. Ingersoll had been bustling with a Resolution to prohibit any motion to adjourn before 6. O’Clock p.m. every day till next Tuesday— It was ultimately laid over one day under the rule— William Cost Johnson followed and employed his hour in unfolding his plan for assuming the debts of the States, or a large portion of them— He promised to bring out his plan more fully hereafter— Then Roger L. Gamble of Georgia replied to the furious assault of his colleague Mark A. Cooper— There was some sparring between them— Cooper denied that he had formed any Coalition with the Tyler party— Gamble alluded to a toast given by Charles J. Ingersoll at a dinner given by the President to his partizans last Monday— Veto and ditto. And to two other political cross fire toasts given at a Tyler and a democratic party at Philadelphia last Monday— Payne of Alabama pronounced an hour of invective against protection— Everett came next with a strong protection speech, and in defence of himself for having signed the whig manifesto at the close of the last Session of Congress— He alluded also to the compromise of 1833, but very feebly, and with his ordinary timorous reserve— W. W. Irwin, one of the corporal’s guard made a Pittsburg Iron-tariff speech of an hour—till 4 O’Clock— Black of Georgia then got the floor, and moved the Committee to rise, but the Chairman urged him to keep hold of Time by the forelock, and made his speech which he did, now, all in petulant invective against the Georgia whigs, and especially Gamble.— Milton Brown of Tennessee, finally closed the debate for the day, by a half Tariff hour speech— Gwin of Mississippi, moved the committee to rise. Sundry bills from the Senate were then read and referred among which was the appropriation for the remainder of the Massachusetts claim. Adjourned at a quarter past 6— Evening visitors. Mr and Mrs Poinsett, and the others. "

                "text": "8. V. Friday.  Mrs Turner is a widow formerly of this City, now of Philadelphia, and entertaining a proposal to remove to Boston— Her maiden name was Adams and her father resided here many years, as her mother still does.— Mrs Turner after the death of her husband, having two small children, went to Philadelphia, and kept there a small dry goods store, till she was burnt out; after which she had engaged to attend in the store of a large establishment of the same kind, from which she is now obliged to retire owing to the total stagnation of business in that city— She had recently received a proposal from a person named E. F. Newhall to go and occupy a similar station in Boston, in a Store number 141. Washington Street— She was inclined to accept this proposal, but wished first to enquire into the character and standing, of Mr Newhall—for which purpose she came to me— I told her I was not personally acquainted with Mr Newhall, but probably Mr Appleton the Representative from Boston was; I would this day enquire of him, and if she would come again to-morrow morning I should be able to give a satisfactory answer to her enquires— She said she would come— Committee of foreign affairs—present Adams, Meriwether, Stuart Cushing, Caruthers, Everett, Granger White—absent Shepperd— Message, declining to send copies of the Quintuple Treaty, and other documents— After some discussions Everett withdrew his Resolution of call, and I moved to postpone the further consideration of the subject indefinitely—agreed— Message, with Bacourt’s Letter proposing a joint establishment by the Governments of the United States and of France of a line of weekly Steamers between Havre and New-York— The impression against this measure seemed unanimous. Reason was piled upon reason against it till Cushing moved that the chairman be directed to prepare a report against the proposal— I said I must request that another member should be charged with that report, for I was for accepting the proposal.— What a startling! What were my reasons? I gave them. Everett now was for giving a courteous answer and calling on the Secretary of State for an estimate of the expense of such an establishment.— Left for further consideration— In the house— Fillmore had the Treasury circular transferred from the Committee of Ways and Means, to the Committee on the judiciary— Stanly reported from the Committee of Military Affairs the Senate Bill for reorganizing the army—referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union— Committee resumed the Tariff-Bill, M’Kennan in the Chair—A. H. H. Stuart—Brewster—Calvary Morris, R. D. Davis, Stanly, Saunders, Weller, Mathiot, Gordon, Daniel speaking when I left the house. Hudson and Burke, discoursed till about 9 O’Clock when the house adjourned. I had gone to dine with John P. Kennedy, Granger, Saltonstall and Appleton. Lord Ashburton, with his 3. Gentlemen were there— Senator Bayard an old Mr Gray. "

Mrs Turner called on me again this morning, and I informed her that I had yesterday made the enquiries which I had promised her I would make, of Mr Appleton, who had assured me that he personally knew Mr Newhall—that he was in good repute, and kept the largest and most fashionable dry goods Store, in Boston.— This was satisfactory to her, and she said she thought she should accept the proposal of Mr Newhall— His object was to introduce into Boston the practice very common in Philadelphia, of employing females to attend in the Stores. I met the select Committee of 5. on the report of the Secretary of State with the Presidents exposition of reasons for signing the apportionment Bill—present Adams, M’Kennan—Pope, and Hunter— Proffit absent. I read to the Committee what I had prepared of a report, which took me half an hour; but it was unfinished, and we had no time to discuss it— We adjourned to next Thursday morning at 9. In the house William Cost Johnson asked leave to introduce, with a very long labyrinth of preamble his plan for the assumption of the State debts— Objection made he moves to suspend the rules, and calls for the yeas and nays—ayes 7. one of which was mine. noes 132. They dont imagine that it will ever become a serious question— Cave Johnson offered a long grubbing resolution about the plundering appropriations for Cherokee Indians, which was adopted and will come to nothing— I reported from the Committee of foreign Affairs the Bill for the relief of Alexander Hammett without Amendment— Fillmore then moved to go into committee of the whole of the state of the Union,—done— M’Kennan in the chair— Tariff bill— Summers and William Smith, both Virginians made counterpart hour speeches for and against the Tariff— John T. Stuart, and Reynolds both of Illinois did the same— Underwood of Kentucky came next and then Wallace of Indiana, a Tariff Speech of great power—while he was speaking, at the earnest and repeated intreaties of Lieutt. Wilkes I went over to his house, and inspected a great number of the drawings collected during the exploring expedition— Portraits of men women and children of the Ocean and Fegee Islands— Fishes—birds, plants, shells, and navigating charts are in great profusion, more than I had time to examine— I returned to the house, and found Patrick G. Goode discoursing on the Tariff after Beeson who had succeeded Wallace— John Hastings of Ohio read an hour Speech. Randall of Maine followed— It was past 6. p.m. I left the house and came home— Almon H. Read, closed the day’s debate— Mrs Baldwin and R. D. Cutts here this Evening. "

Sunday  I attended with my wife, and Mrs. John Adams public worship at the Hall of the House of Representatives where the services were performed by Mr Maffitt, after an absence of five weeks— It was announced in the Globe last evening that he was to preach on “the moral aspects of the 19th. century.” His text was Revelation 19.6 “And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.” The discourse was a rhapsodical declamation upon the moral improvements of the age—Sunday Schools—Bible—Tract—Missionary and Temperance Societies— But no abolition—not even colonization— Not one word on the subject of Slavery or emancipation. Oh! no! we never mention her! Mr Maffitt gave notice that he should preach in the Hall, next Sunday, and the Sunday after—when he would deliver a discourse on the mysterious fate of the Revd. George Cookman, heretofore a chaplain of the house who in March 1841. embarked at New-York for Liverpool in the Steamer President, which with all on board perished at Sea— Before dinner, Mr John C. Spencer, Secretary of War called on me with a message from Daniel Webster Secretary of State, who he said was on his back with rhumatism in his back.— Mr Webster sent for my perusal a translation of a note to him from Joaquin Velazquez de Leon, styling himself Chargé d’Affaires of the Mexican Republic, dated at New-York, and enclosing to him two notes of 18 and 31. May last from Jose Maria de Bocanegra, the Mexican Secretary of State, bitterly complaining of the toleration by the Government of the United States of the hostile interference of their citizens in the civil War between Mexico and Texas— Mr Spencer says that Velazquez styles himself Chargé d’Affaires but has never presented himself as such, or with any credentials at the Department of State— Mr Webster wished for my advice, and thought it most expedient that there should be a call from the house for the Documents. He would answer the two notes from Bocanegra to-morrow— I had a long conversation with Mr Spencer, in which his opinion of the present prospects of the negotiation with Lord Ashburton were more favourable than I believe the facts will warrant— After dinner, at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read the evening service for the 7th. Sunday after Trinity and preached from Luke 21.31. “So like wise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.” After church— I went to Mr Webster’s house to see him, but was told by a servant that he was riding out— Then I went to Major Turnbull’s to see Mr and Mrs. Abbott Lawrence, but, there was nobody at home there— I returned to my own home— My wife and Mary went out and spent the Evening at Mrs Madison’s— I passed it in writing and musing over my own condition, and that of my country at the close of my seventy-fifth year— "

There is a bill before the house to legalize them; reported by Mr Briggs, chairman of the Committee on Post-Offices and Post-roads, for which Mr Smith solicited my support. Dr Mayo came to enquire if I had found his letter to me, when he communicated to me his Letter to President Jackson of Decr. 1830 and Jackson’s to Fulton then Secretary of Arkansas. I had not. The Dr expects to obtain a new trial of his libel suit against Blair and Rives. He told me that David Fulton, father of the Senator had deposited what purported to be the original Letter from Jackson to Fulton of Decr 1830—but he suspected it to be a fabrication ex post facto, and that Jackson never sent the Letter to Fulton— This is absurd, and only shews the Doctor’s suspicious nature— Edmund Addington is a young man, who has come all the way from Martha’s Vineyard, to apply for an appointment as an Officer in the Marine Corps. He asked my advice. I enquired if he had any recommendatory Letters or certificates of character?— He could get some— I advised him to go to the Secretary of War, but said I was sorry he had come so far, with so poor a change of success. Mr Wright is here to circulate his translation of La Fontaine’s fables in two octavo volumes with a multitude of copper-plate engravings— He says the work cost him 6000 dollars of which he has realized 4500— But he meets with little or no encouragement from members of Congress.— I found the house in Session— M’Kennan asked leave to present Resolutions of a meeting, at West Alexander, Washington County Pennsylvania against Tyler and the little Tariff veto— But objection was made—suspension of the rules refused, and the Resolutions not received.— John W. Jones presented sundry anti-tariff resolutions, and attempted to speak; but they were laid on the table— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, M’Kennan in the chair.— Tariff or Revenue Bill— Holmes of South-Carolina, Dixon H. Lewis, John Minor Botts, Charles J. Ingersoll, Robert M. T. Hunter, Ezra Dean, and Elisha H. Allen, hammered out each a one hour speech for and against protection— At 6. O’Clock p.m. I left Allen speaking and came home—the house continued in Session, till half past twelve at night, with less than 40 members present, one drowsy Orator succeeding to another, hour by hour, without intermission and nobody listening to any one of them— We had a small evening party at home. I am snatching every possible moment, at home or in the house, for the draft of a Report on the exposition of the President’s reasons for signing the apportionment bill. "

Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs— Present Adams, Stuart, Everett, Cushing, Caruthers, Granger, White— Absent Shepperd and Meriwether.— The Steam Packet line Negotiation was passed over. C. P. Van Ness’s accounts, assigned for consideration on Friday next. The Letter from the Secretary of State, with the enclosed note from the French Minister de Bacourt and other documents relating to the claim of the house of La Fitte were debated till the house-bell rang, but no conclusion— In the house, I offered a Resolution in two clauses, calling on the President for the diplomatic correspondence with Mexico, and with Texas— It was no sooner read than Pickens started up, and said he had no objection to the first branch of my Resolution, but he had to the second, whereupon Fillmore insisted that if debate was to arise it must lie over— I then intreated that the question might be taken on the first branch of my resolution the call for correspondence with Mexico— Landaff W. Andrews now came in savage as a famished wolf, called for the reading of my resolution and objected to the reception, and the Speaker sustained him in his objection— I called for a suspension of the rules and demanded the yeas and nays, which were ordered— Thereupon Andrews withdrew his objection—the question was taken on the first branch of my resolution, which was adopted with scarcely a negative voice— Pickens still objected to the second branch of my resolution— I extorted from the Speaker a promise that it should be taken up at my call to-morrow morning, and then submitted to its lying over.— Fillmore then moved a Resolution, postponing the territorial business assigned for tomorrow, and the two succeeding days, till the first three days of next week, and postponing the final question, on the Tariff bill, till Friday next at 12. O’Clock, allowing from this day at Noon till then for amendments of detail, each mover of an amendment, to have 15 minutes and any one member 10 minutes to oppose it.— This resolution he finally carried through by two successive suspensions of the rules— Jacob Thompson then made a foolish hour speech and George B. Cary of Southampton, Virginia a remnant of twenty minutes till noon, when down came the Chairman’s hammer— And the commenced the amendments of detail. All the chicanery of the house now came into play.— The Committee rose after 4. O’Clock— Underwood sprung upon the house by surprise a Resolution postponing the retrenchment of the hostler John Lee, till the close of the present Session— It passed by acclamation in spite of the pettish remonstrances of Cave Johnson— He raved remonstrance till the house on the motoin of Briggs cut him short by adjourning. I received short evening visits from Mr Gurley with Mr Emery, Minister at North Weymouth. "

December last, which I did not obtain, I barely reached the Hall of the house, while Mr Maffitt was saying grace over the coming deliberations of the day. The instant French, the sub clerk had closed the reading of yesterday’s journal I started up with the shrill cry—Mr Speaker!— But Cave Johnson who had stationed himself in the lane right opposite the chair caught his eye, and got the floor.— He moved a reconsideration of the vote of mercy to the stable keeper John Lee, snatched from the good nature of the house last evening by Underwood. Cave launched out into lamentations and indignations, with a direct thrust at Briggs who was last evening in the Speakers chair, for putting the question to spare John Lee for this Session, without heeding his Cave’s fiery remonstrances. Cave’s motion for reconsideration was first met with the objection, that he having voted in the minority and against the resolution could not move a reconsideration; but he persisted in scolding, till Bowne a brother radical, who had voted as he said for the resolution, took pity on Cave and moved the reconsideration— And now Cave flourished away upon retrenchment and reform—the uselessness of the services of the Stable keeper John Lee, and the fortune he was heaping up, by hiring out to other people his six horses.— Cave demanded the yeas and nays upon the reconsideration, and it was carried 79 to 70.— Then upon the Resolution itself which was again carried 84 to 80. and so this mountain of patriotic parsimony was delivered of its mouse.— An hour and a half had been consumed in this trifling, and my second shriek of “Mr Speaker!” brought him to. I called up the second branch of my Resolution offered yesterday; the call for the correspondence with Texas— Pickens feebly objected; said he would not press his objection, but did press it, and called piteously on any member of the Committee of foreign affairs to help him.— Cushing started up and moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— I said if my colleague wishes to suppress information, tis time to call at least for the yeas and nays—there were barely enough rose to obtain them— I said it was for the sole purpose of taking the question on my resolution. Cushing called me to order, and said “no debate”! and he carried his motion 99 to 74. half the house not knowing what was the alternative. M’Kennan took the chair— I was boiling with indignation, but suppressed my feelings and submitted in silence— They skirmished upon the tariff-bill till 4. O’Clock, when the Committee rose— I instantly called up my Resolution again and moved the previous question— Pickens was gone— Cushing was silent— Thompson of Mississippi moved to adjourn—refused. Caruthers questioned whether the Resolution was in order. The Speaker said it was— Snyder called for the yeas and nays—refused, and my resolution was adopted with an almost universal shout. The house immediately afterwards adjourned— I left the draught of my Report on the President’s Message, relating to the apportionment Bill to be copied in the Clerk’s Office, and walked about half way home— Mary Cutts was here this evening.

Thursday  Meeting at 9 O’Clock of the select Committee on the President’s Message of 25 June announcing to the house that he had caused to be deposited in the Office of the Secretary of State, accompanying the apportionment act, an exposition of his reasons for giving his sanction to it— Present Adams, M’Kennon, Pope— Absent Hunter and Proffit— I read the remainder of my report, about half of which I had read at the last meeting— It concludes with a Resolution protesting against this act of the President, and against its ever being adduced as a precedent hereafter— M’Kennon concurred entirely with the report— Pope agreed to its being presented to the house, but not to the report itself— He had voted against the districting section in the Bill, and had voted to lay on the table the motion to refer the message to a select Committee— Wise had as usual brow-beaten the Speaker by the base insinuation that he would appoint a Committee of the bitterest enemies, of the President, and they would report violent measures, the result of which would be to raise the President to the very pinnacle of popularity, and to prostrate the whig party forever— The Speaker as usual cowered under Wise’s scourge, and appointed 3 out of 5. members of the Committee, Tylerites.— Proffit at the last meeting asked me, if I should have any objection to a counter-report—to which I answered, none in the world. The House went immediately after the reading of the Journal went into committee of the whole on the state of the Union, M’Kennon in the chair on the details of the Tariff Bill— The day was consumed in numberless motions of amendment, a very large portion of them mere chicanery to waste time and throw obstacles in the way of the passage of the Bill— About 4. O’Clock this tiresome foolery was superseded by the rising of the Committee— Beeson then offered an amendment to strike out the 25th. Section, the land distribution and insert three sections, as a substitute, to levy stamp duties on Notes and Bank bills— Objection was made— Beeson moved a suspension of the rules, the objection was withdrawn, and Beeson’s amendment was laid on the table and ordered to be printed— Arnold gave notice that he would next Monday ask leave to introduce a Bill to reduce the pay and mileage of the members of Congress.— The Speaker presented a Message from the President, with the correspondence with Mexico, in answer to the first branch of my resolution adopted by the house last Monday— It was read, ordered to be printed and referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs— The Speaker presented also certain Resolutions of the whig, Clay, anti-Tyler committee at New York— Objection was made to their being received, and the house fell into confusion, in which a motion to adjourn was carried. There had been thunder part of the day, and the remainder of it was showery— Mrs. W. S. Smith came from her brother’s to our house. "

Van Ness as Minister to Spain had been assigned for this morning. Present Adams, Cushing, Everett, Granger, Caruthers—absent Meriwether, White, Shepperd and Stuart. Mr Cushing read about one half of a long report upon Van Ness’s Accounts; on which conversational debate arose as he proceeded—item by item till we were obliged to adjourn—to attend the house— Everett moved and we agreed to meet again and finish this business to-morrow Morning— In the house, I attempted to get the floor to present my report on the apportionment bill message, but failed. Cushing on account of pressure of the tariff bill on which the debate was to cease at 12 O’Clock, moved to go immediately into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Moore of Louisiana, at the same time asked leave to offer two new Sections to the tariff bill, and to have them printed; alledging that they were intended to suppress abominable frauds in the collection of duties on sugar, and allowance of draw-backs on exported molasses, but no debate was allowed. Moore moved to suspend the rules, but it was refused— Part of Moore’s object was to provide that upon cotton imported from Texas and exported, only one percent of the duty should be retained of the drawback and that drawback should be allowed on all foreign goods exported by land to Texas and Mexico— I could not obtain the question upon the reception of my report— The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and debated further the details of the tariff Bill, till half past 6. O’Clock when at Botts’s motion, the Committee rose and reported the Bill; Bronson of Maine immediately moved the previous question; whereupon the house immediately adjourned— Mr Aaron Leggett one of the large Claimants on Mexico came to me this morning, with a memorial to Congress stating the facts of his claim, and invoking the interposition of Congress to obtain payment of it— He said he wished to have some conversation with me concerning it. I appointed 8 O’Clock this evening to see him at my house; and just as we rose from dinner he came— He remained with me upwards of an hour arguing with me on the duty of Congress either to compel Mexico to pay him or to assume and pay the debt for this Nation— I told him that I should be willing to give all proper consideration to his memorial, and to agree to any practical measure consistent with justice for his relief— But he complained almost as much, and with as much justice of this Government as of Mexico— The Convention for the settlement of the claims, was so wretchedly contrived, that its real object must have been, to multiply and aggravate the causes of War between the two Countries. Mr and Mrs Abbott Lawrence and Mrs Turnbull, spent a short evening with us— My wife has been very unwell; but is recovering. "

Absent Meriwether, Shepperd and White— Cushing, concluded the reading of his report which was discussed, and slightly amended— It was accepted, and Mr Cushing was authorised to present it to the house— It substantially sustains. Mr Van Ness’s charges upon all the items disallowed by the 5th. Auditor Pleasonton, and the Secretary of State Forsyth— They amount to upwards of 25000 dollars in a mission of 7 years. Van Ness has raked and scraped at every possible table for crumbs of contingency and actually increased his Salary from 9 to more than 12000 dollars a year— Yet he is able to adduce precedent for every charge, and like a tavern-keeper, who upon any objection made to his bill trumps up new charges, he now claims of right, Salary from the day of his appointment, though notified at the time of his appointment, that it would begin from the time of his departure from home on his mission—Cushing favours all the charges, because he keeps a steady eye upon a mission abroad, himself— Everett favours them all because Van Ness is a Vermonter, with whom he sees it is for his interest to be well;—Granger favours most of them from the liberality of his spirit, but he scores out two or three of the most rapacious items; and the Southern economists would gladly apply the retrenching sickle, but wish to cast the responsibility of the operation upon me— Cushing’s report studiously evades the expression of an opinion against any one of the charges; but refers back to the executive, and the judicial Courts those that are glaringly illegal and iniquitious— The result will be the admission of them all— In the house, I presented the report from the select Committee on the apportionment bill message; and moved that it be laid on the table and printed; and that the Resolution at the close of the report should be read— Cushing enquired whether I proposed to consider the resolution now. I said no— Not until the report should be printed. Bowne objected to its being received— I moved a suspension of the rules— Barnard moved that the Committees should be called for Reports, whereupon Bowne withdrew his objection to the reception of mine— It was laid on the table and ordered to be printed— The previous question had been moved last Evening, on the engrossment of the tariff-bill—there was now a second to the motion, but the question shall the main question be now put was taken by yeas and nays, and decided in the negative 98 to 102.— Christopher H. Williams moved a reconsideration, which was carried 110 to 104.— The day was then consumed in taking yeas and nays on swarms of amendments till near 6. O’Clock— Then the bill passed to engrossment 116 to 111 and passed 116 to 112— Reconsideration moved and refused— Adjourned. "

After the Tariff bill had passed last Evening, John Campbell of South-Carolina moved an amendment to its titles to read a Bill for the protection of manufactures and for other purposes— Mark A. Cooper moved as an Amendment to this amendment, A bill to raise revenue for the support of Government and for the protection of manufactures— Cooper’s amendment was immediately rejected, but Campbell insisted upon having the question upon his taken by yeas and nays and it was also rejected; by a large majority— Many of the whigs, inclined to adopt his amendment, and it would have been very acceptable to the North as an avowed assertion by Congress of the protective principle, I could not well account for Campbell’s pertinacity in urging it, till Gamble told me that President Tyler had in the most energetic manner, that if the word protection was used in the title to the bill— After this flurry was over a poor Pennsylvania mute hucusque came down from his seat in the outer circumference—took his stand upon the area fronting the Speaker’s chair, and gave notice that at the next Session of Congress he would introduce a Bill for levying a tax upon paper money, made in the similitude of metallic coin. This morning I attended the public services at the Hall of the House of Representatives where Mr Maffit preached from Psalm 97.1. [“]The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. 2. Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.”— After the ceremonies I walked home. I thought I could extract nothing good.— Mr Maffit was more rhapsodical than I had ever known him—but the house was full. He gave notice that he should preach again next Sunday at the Capitol; but that he should defer the Sermon upon the death of Mr Cookman till the Sunday after next, as he was waiting to receive some information concerning some of the incidents of his life— After dinner at St. John’s church, Mr Hawley read the Evening prayers for the 8th. Sunday after Trinity, and preached from Luke 12.32 “Fear not, little flock; for it is your father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” Though he did not name the book from which he took his text— In the evening we had visits from Coll. Talcott of the Ordnance corps, and from Mr Connell.— Coll. Talcott came to speak . . . the report concerning the condition of the Armoury at Springfield— And there is a similar complaint respecting the Armoury at Harper’s ferry— Coll Talcott gave me at large his views upon the questions relating to the superintendence of the Armouries— Mr Connell was also here—from Wilmington, Delaware, where he now resides.

Monday  Mr Leggett brought this morning the manuscript report of the American Commissioners under the Convention with Mexico, upon his claim; which he requested me to present with his memorial, and to move that it be printed— Leggett’s original claim was one in which he had no right to claim the interposition of the Government of the United States— But this mode of intermeddling with the claims of our citizens upon foreign Governments has become quite familiar to us, and we have not yet very closely examined how far it will warrant foreign nations in reciprocating the practice with us.— Leggett’s claim and many others upon Mexico were taken up by Jackson’s administration to make an offset to the enormous outrages of Jackson himself and his administration against Mexico—and when in 1837. Jackson’s project of kindling a War with Mexico, was baffled and defeated, he left his successor Van Buren to trump up a Convention, which he well knew would terminate in no adjustment or satisfaction of the claims, but leaving them, aggravated causes of War— And now these claims are saddled upon us, so that we cannot cast them off— At the meeting of the house, I attempted to offer Leggett’s memorial, with the Report of the American Commissioners, but could not get a hearing even to ask for the printing of these papers— Arnold attempted to introduce the bill, of which he had given notice to reduce 25 per cent the pay, and mileage of the members of Congress, and the salaries of all the executive Officers, but he was not permitted to introduce it, and he opposed the introduction of any thing else— Barnard struggled to report two bills from the judiciary committee, but could not succeed— This and the two succeeding days, had been assigned for the consideration of Bills relating to the Territories— Pope Chairman of the Committee on the territories moved to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union—the Speaker called John W. Jones to the chair—he declined taking it, and the Speaker called Thomas W. Gilmer in his place. Stokely from the Committee of Military Affairs, called up a bill from the Senate, for the armed occupation of Florida—amended by the military Committee— Everett and W. Cost Johnson started an opposition to the bill which consumed the day in debate— I took myself a part in this debate without success— Sundry amendments were moved some of them carried—others rejected— The Committee rose twice for want of a Quorum and there was one call of the house— The Amendment reported by the military Committee, amended by the Committee of the whole, was reported to the house—the engrossment of the Bill was carried by yeas and nays 80 to 50 and the passage of the bill 82 to 50.— Pickens moved a reconsideration and I moved to adjourn which was carried shortly before six— We had evening visits from Mr and Mrs. Daniel Webster, with Miss Fletcher and from Mr Kent of Maine.

Tuesday  Mr Leggett was again here this morning, enquiring about his memorial, with the report of the American Commissioners upon his claim; I told him I had attempted in vain yesterday morning to present them to the house. That I would repeat the attempt this morning; but as objection from a single member is potent to prevent its reception it would probably not be possible to obtain its admission— Leggett was red hot for War till I told him that the first coup de canon would spunge his claim. Now he is for an armed negotiation, to purchase a slice of California, and especially the harbour of San Francisco, and paying for it with the claims. Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs.— Present Adams, Stuart Cushing, Caruthers, White— Absent Everett, Granger, Meriwether and Shepperd— Cushing brought up a claim ofPinkney Administrator of Charles Williams upon the French indemnity claim convention— Cushing said it was not a valid claim, and it was referred to Cushing for a report against it— A petition for a large appropriation to support an expedition to occupy and settle the Territory of Oregon— Agreed to pass it over. The Message, with the application of the French Minister Bacourt by order of his Government, for a joint establishment of a line of Mail Steamers between Havre and New-York was taken up—and I was directed to prepare a Resolution to be presented to the House, calling on the President to cause estimates and a report to Congress at the commencement of the next Session to be made of the expense of forming and maintaining such an establishment— In the house I made another very urgent attempt to present Mr Leggett’s Memorial and the report on his claim, but could not obtain a hearing— Casey asked leave to offer a joint Resolution for adjourning Congress on Monday the 1st. of August at 2. p.m.— Fillmore objected— Casey moved a suspension of the rules; but this was not in order; the special order devoting these three days to the business of the territories overriding all other orders— Casey then moved to postpone the special order of the day—a call of the house, and the yeas and nays— The call of the house produced 157 names in answer— Upon the yeas and nays there was 81 to 84. and the house refused the permission to introduce the Resolution— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, T. W. Gilmer in the Chair— The first bill taken up was of appropriations for the harbours of Milwaukie, Racine, and Southport in the Wiskonsin which raised a long debate, and was followed by sundry other bills and much debate till near 6—when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— I went to hear Count Barato at the Apollo hall— But there was no audience and I came home— Tremendous thunder-shower— Richard and Mary Cutts here.

Kearney, at the Corner of 14th. street, within stones throw of my door; and staved in one of the windows of his house. It strip’d the tree of a small portion of its bark on one side, with out other apparent damage— Mr Leavitt called on me this morning. He is to leave the City to-morrow for Boston— He has collected for me several slips from newspapers relating to the affairs of Mexico and Texas, which I may want for debate hereafter— I am grieved that I have it not in my power to render useful service to this excellent man, who is of the salt of the earth— The woman named Louisa Wood came again and brought a Letter from another woman named Laura Rice, complaining of ill-treatment by certain persons in the State of Ohio— It was apparent from the Letter, that the woman who wrote it was insane, and I had already strong suspicions that Louisa Wood, was in much the same condition— I told her that I considered her so, but she insisted that she was not— I said that at all events, I could be of no service to her or her friend from whom she had brought the Letter—and I advised her not to trouble herself to come to me again— I found the house in Session, and John Edwards of Missouri was speaking against a Bill to fix the boundary between the territory of Iowa, and the State of Missouri.— He spoke through his hour, and when arrested by the chairman’s hammer struggled sometime for another hour, by moving an amendment thereby changing the question— Wise once succeeded at the special Summer Session last year in this trick and spoke two hours at one time— But the chairman now decided that the amendment involved the same question upon which the member had spoken, and that he therefore could not continue his speech— He closed therefore by presenting an amendment substitute for the Bill, against which Augustus C. Dodge the delegate from Iowa made his hour speech.— A succession of territorial bills followed till a bill for establishing a new collection district in Florida which after debate a motion being made to reject the bill, the numbskull chairman Gilmer put the question whether the bill should be reported and pronounced it carried in the negative.— Accordingly he did not the bill report the bill with the rest— I made a question of order of it; and the Speaker and Gilmer brazened it out that the Committee were not bound to report the bill. I advised the Speaker to look into Hatsell, Gilmer said there was nothing about it in Hatsell. Adjourned after 5.— Mr Frye, Mr Lawrence and William Darby were here this evening. "

He spoke also of the claim of his brother Thomas Ap Catesby Jones, for services in an expedition to the Sandwich Islands— The Commodore has a judgment against him as surety for a defaulting Postmaster of about 5000 dollars, and his wife and brother claim this allowance as a set off to that debt— Mr Leggett came again to enquire after his memorial and the report accompanying it.

Arnold attempted again to introduce his bill for reducing the pay and mileage of members of Congress and the salaries of executive officers.— I succeeded at last in introducing Mr Leggett’s memorial, with the report of the American Commissioners on his case. Cave Johnson at first objected to the printing but afterwards at the request of Houston of Alabama, withdrew his objection—and the order for printing was adopted— Pickens of South-Carolina had moved on Tuesday to reconsider the vote passing the Bill for the armed occupation of Florida. He then suffered yesterday to pass over without calling it up; and this morning he said he withdraw it Briggs questioned his right to withdraw— The Speaker decided he had although the time had passed within which any other member could make the motion— Briggs appealed from the decision, but it was sustained by the house 93 to 79 upon a motion of C J. Ingersoll to lay the appeal on the table. The resolution of the judiciary Committee declaring it inexpedient to extend the bankrupt act to Corporations then came up, and Roosevelt concluded a Speech he had begun before, on an amendment reversing the opinion of the judiciary Committee.

The previous question was then called and while pending Arnold renewed the motion to lay all upon the table and it was carried— Sundry other Reports were made, till the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the Navy appropriation bill returned from the Senate with amendments— Mr Burnell and myself were both denied the floor, for having made hour speeches when the bill was up in Committee— Cave Johnson made an hour speech against concurring with the first amendment of the Senate increasing the appropriation for pay— Wise made a brutal attack upon me, for having exposed the enormous disproportion of Virginian Navy Officers— Caruthers took the floor at half past 5. the Committee rose and the house adjourned.— Dr. Edward Jarvis of Louisville, Kentucky with a young clergyman brought me a Letter of invitation, to a meeting of teachers in that city.

Friday  As I took my seat in the house this morning Mr Granger who sits immediately behind me, said that the Committee this morning had supposed I was sick, as that was the only way to account for my absence— It was the Committee of foreign affairs, and the real cause of my absence, I am mortified to say, was that I forgot it was the day for the meeting of the Committee— There were present at the Meeting only Granger, Carruthers, Stuart, Shepperd and Cushing— He was authorised to report unfavourably to the house on the petition of Somerville Pinkney Administrator of James Williams.— In the house— Botts presented a petition from Wetumpka in the State of Alabama praying Congress to pass a Resolution, requesting the acting President to resign, and if he refuses, to impeach him— Laid on the table— Mark a Cooper offered a Resolution to enquire of the Secretary of the Treasury, who is dangerously ill with a fever, why the Bank return report has not been made; and when it may be expected— Not received. The report from the judiciary that it is not expedient to extend the bankrupt Law so as to embrace corporations, was in order for debate, but Cave Johnson moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, which was finally done. Romulus M. Saunders in the chair and the Amendments of the Senate to the Navy Appropriation Bill— Caruthers made an hour speech, against concurring with the Senate’s first amendment which was to increase the item of pay, about half a million which the house had curtailed from the estimates of the Secretary— Cushing made two or three captious issues with Caruthers while he was speaking, but always to his own discomfiture.— There was but a half an hour left for debate, which was occupied by Thomas Butler King, who as heretofore was for the Senate’s amendment and the largest expenditures— At the hour of Noon down came the chairman’s hammer—and the voting began. the first of the Senate’s amendments the increased item was non-concurred by Tellers 66 to 89.— The second, after sundry abortive attempts to amend it, among which one by me to make the officers from each State in the Navy, proportionate to the number of Seamen from the same State was also non-concurred—ayes by tellers only 40. of the other amendments some were adopted, and others rejected—till the bill was reported to the house. W. W. Irwin moved instantly the previous question. I asked him to withdraw his motion, to give me an opportunity to offer some remarks on a personal attack made on me yesterday. He refused to withdraw but only 39 votes seconded him— I took the floor, and answered Wise, according to his folly— Burnell then spoke his hour upon his own plan.— Wise then replied to me in his own way—closing with a threat of murdering me in my seat.— Charles Brown scored him for his insolence to him— It was near 6 when the house adjourned. One had for evening visitors Mr Hawley and others. "

Mr. M’Lochlin who was here last evening, is one of the Commissioners from the Province of New-Brunswick in attendance upon the negotiation just now concluded between The Secretary of State and Lord Ashburton. Mr M’Lochlan is an inhabitant of Fredericton, and seemed either not aware that the negotiation was concluded, or desirous of appearing so; for he said he was told, he must stay here till September, and jokingly alluded to a recent rumour that the St. John’s river would be the boundary, which would bring him and Fredericton into the State of Maine— Mr Acosta is chargé d’Affaires from the Republic of New-Grenada, and one of the most intelligent, well informed and social men that I have seen from the South-American Republics. I attended at 9 this morning, in the Senate’s Committee room, of Military affairs, a meeting of the delegations from Massachusetts and Maine, in both houses— There were 15 present, but Mr Choate was absent, and all the democratic members from Maine.— The Bill appropriating money for payment of the adjusted balance of the Massachusetts claim has passed the Senate, but labours in the military Committee of the house. Mr Bates called this meeting, and a Committee of 3 members from Massachusetts in the house, Briggs, Hudson, and Parmenter was chosen to attend the meeting of the Military Committee of the house and explain to their satisfaction the merits of the claim— I was asked to act as chairman of this Committee but requested to be excused, having been absent from this country throughout the last war with Great-Britain, when all these claims originated, and having paid no special attention to them in the long series of years during which they have been in a process of adjustment— In the house, Arnold figetted about the introduction of his bill to reduce the pay of members of Congress and the Salaries of executive officers but could not obtain a suspension of the rules to introduce it. Cowen pleaded earnestly but in vain for the devotion of the day to private bills— The question was taken upon the report of the judiciary committee that it is not expedient to pass a corporation bankrupt Law— The resolution was negatived by yeas and nays 53 to 113. and yet the house was so entangled with forms and rules of order that the banks slip’d through their fingers and escaped— Barnard from the judiciary Committee presented a report, and a bill; and after a sharp altercation with Saunders a member of the same Committee the question of printing the report was carried by yeas and nays— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Summers in the chair on the amendments of the Senate to the Army appropriation Bill— Explosion. Committee rose, and the house adjourned soon after 2— Walk in the President’s grounds— Dr Frye here. "

                "text": "24. V:30— Sunday  The explosion noticed yesterday sounded its first crack by Gwin of Mississippi, who announced that he had voted for all the reductions of the army when the bill was before the house—but that he might perhaps change his vote now: as there were rumours of a Treaty agreed upon between the Secretary of State and Lord Ashburton, by which a large portion of the Territory of the State of Maine was to be ceded to Great-Britain; and he had rather a thousand times have a War— Black of Georgia swallowed back all the bile he had disgorged upon the army, and said he had found upon enquiry that the second Regiment of dragoons was the finest regiment in the army, and its Colonel (Twiggs, a Georgian) one of the most gallant Officers that lives— He too is now for increasing instead of reducing the army. Gilmer said he should still vote for reducing the army, though, if the Treaty should be such as Gwin had represented it he should be as much as Gwin himself against it— This burning patriotism for Maine is kindled at the stake prepared for Madison Washington— The Creole slave-traders, and the repudiating debtors of Mississippi, are the guardians of the sanctity of the territory of Maine— This debate is a premonitory symptom of acrid matter to come— Landaff W. Andrews with his March hare look, moved the Committee to rise, to stifle debate—the vote to rise was 38 to 44—a majority against rising, but compelled to rise and report no quorum—whereupon just after 2 the house adjourned.— There was another long snarl upon a message from the President, with a counter-report to that of Poindexter on the New-York Custom-house, by Stewart, another of the Commissioners— There was a heavy tug against the order to point this report, but it was finally carried by yeas and nays 84 to 66— After the adjournment I went to the chamber of the Committee of foreign affairs and wrote there till near 6— Mrs John Adams dined at Mr Frye’s, where Mrs Smith has been these two days, and remains. After dinner I went and heard the music of the marine band upon the grounds back of the Presidents house— Met there John Hastings a democratic member of the house from Ohio, who never speaks but occasionally reads a long speech. He is an Irishman; and has remnants of the brogue. He told me that he had a brother—Sir Charles H. Hastings, a baronet—a General Officer in the British army and many years, until the present Parliament a member of the house of Commons. I met also on the grounds James Graham, and Joseph L. Williams. My wife went to Mr Frye’s, and brought Mary home with her— Doctor Frye came with them, but was unwell, and made no stay.  The preceding page, is rather a continuation of yesterdays Diary than properly belonging to this day. I went alone this morning to the Hall of the house of representatives, and heard Mr Maffitt preach, from Matthew 20.6. last clause of the verse—“why stand ye here, all the day, idle?” Congress have got into so bad repute for neglect of business, that there appeared to be a sarcasm couched under the surface of the text— I suppose it was suggested by the prevailing prejudice against Congress, but there was no allusion to it direct or indirect in the Sermon— That was specially and very earnestly addressed to the members of Congress, and they were in bold and unmeasured terms charged with standing here all the day idle— I could not fail to observe the address with which he preserved through the whole discourse the tone of severe reproach and stern rebuke, and yet steered clear of every sore spot of his auditory— His charge of idleness was not of negligence to the affairs of this world, but on the contrary of excessive devotion to it. He said the members of Congress had no heart— They were all head, all intellect—absorbed and imbedded in worldly concerns, but religion must come from the heart, and they had no heart— Then he rang the changes for upwards of an hour upon the various ways of standing all the day idle, talked very boastfully about himself—gloried in the blessings he had received from an old woman, who told him that he had reclaimed a vicious son of hers from wickedness to virtue— He gave notice that he should preach the funeral Sermon of Mr Cookman next Sunday— After dinner there was a transient thunder shower, which passed off in time for me to attend at St. John’s church. Mr Hawley read the Evening prayer for the 9th. Sunday after Trinity, and preached from Psalm 149.2. “Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their king.” Auditory very small— After church I went over and sat an hour in conversation with Mr Thomas B. Johnson— Mrs Frye was there when I went, but soon after went home— Thence on my return homeward, I stop’d at Lord Ashburton’s, and spent an hour with him— I understood from him that all the sharp points of his negotiation are adjusted and settled, though the Treaty is not yet drawn up, and executed in form— The Oregon territory and Columbia river question remains open. I conjecture the same of the Creole case, for upon that he said he had been able to yield little or nothing. And that he supposed Mr Calhoun would not like it—but he could not help it— This remark opened the dungeon. "

Monday  Upon the reading of the Journal of the House this morning, Arnold observed that no notice was taken in it of the motion he had made on Saturday to suspend the rules for the introduction of his bill; which had been objected to by R. M. Saunders for the reduction of the pay and mileage of members of Congress— The Speaker said the usage was not to enter upon the journal unsuccessful motions to suspend the rules, unless the yeas and nays are taken.— Arnold said he had asked the yeas and nays, but the house had refused them. The Speaker said the motion would be entered, but not the name of the objector, which is never done.— Fillmore called up the Resolution he had offered on Saturday, to take the questions on the amendments of the Senate to the army appropriation bill, in Committee on the whole of the state of the Union, this day at one O’Clock, and moved the previous question which was carried by yeas and nays, called for by Pickens 91 to 56.— He then moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. carried— Summers in the chair.— The first amendment of the Senate struck out the proviso in the bill as it went from the house, reducing the army to the standard of the act of 1821. and withholding pay from the 2d Regiment of dragoons, after the 30th. of next September, and substituted another, and much scantier reduction— The question was on concurring with the amendment of the Senate, recommended by the chairmen of the Committees of Ways and Means, Fillmore, and of Military Affairs. Cave Johnson rather feebly objected to concurring in the Amendment and called the house to stand by its own principle of reduction— Ward of New-York urged an immediate decision, and said he had received many Letters complaining of the delay to pass the army appropriation Bill. James Graham of North-Carolina made a short speech against concurring with the Senate and Caruthers did the same— I assumed the same ground, and made a speech of about three quarters of an hour urging to the extent of my power that the house would not concur with the amendment of the Senate— Horace Everett followed me, and said when the bill had first been before the house he had voted against the reduction of the army, because during the pendency of an important negotiation, he did not think it proper to change the military position of the country— But since what he had heard from Gilmer on Saturday, he believed the President was about to veto the Treaty now on the point of conclusion; and he should now vote against concurring with the Senate—an explanation was then made by Gilmer disclaiming any particular intercourse with the President but avowing the hope that the Treaty would not be ratified. The vote in the Committee to concur was 49 to 100. all the other amendments of the Senate except two were non-concurred— In the house the vote on the main amendment, by yeas and nays was 65 to 117— Arnold then moved again and obtained a suspension of the rules and introduced his bill— A curious scene ensued till the adjournment.

L. Brent, for an outfit as Chargé d’Affaires at Madrid in 1815. After some discussion Mr Stuart was authorised to make the reports to the house.— In the house James Cooper presented certain Tariff Memorials from Pennsylvania, and William O. Goode presented a memorial from Hugh A. Garland in self defence against charges affecting his character as Clerk of the House of Representatives in the 25th. and 26th. Congresses— After some objection from L. W. Andrews, which he afterwards withdrew it was referred to the Committee on public expenditures, and ordered to be printed.— Arnold then called up his bill to reduce the compensation of members of Congress, and the salaries of public officers— The question left last evening was upon the rejection of the bill.— First came a call of the house, which produced first 143 and secondly 168 names in answer, then 11 excuses, and then further proceedings dispensed with— Arnold moved to refer the bill to a committee— Everett opposed this and moved the previous question. L. W. Andrews moved to lay the bill on the table—which was refused, and the previous question rejected 67 to 71. Arnold renewed his motion to refer the bill to a select Committee, and that he should not be a member of the Committee— Richard W. Thompson of Indiana moved a string of amendments, as instructions to the Committee, which he supported with a very eloquent hour speech. Botts, Dixon H. Lewis, Fillmore, Shields, Gwin, followed and Gwin made a coarse and groundless attack on Fillmore chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means for delay to bring forward his tariff Bill at an earlier period of the session— Bowne made a modest and moderate speech, a rarity for him, against the Bill— Gilmer after an explanation with Everett, moved to take up his retrenchment bill instead of Arnold’s— Debate continued— Previous Question on engrossment carried 89 to 72. Bill engrossed. 89 to 79— T. F. Marshall’s Speech against the Bill. W. B. Campbell moves reconsideration. Adjourned. "

In the house, the morning hour was allotted to the reception of reports from Committees, among which I presented the report of the Committee of foreign Affairs on the Message Doct. N. 151. the proposal from the French Government, to establish a weekly line of Steamers between Havre and New York, concluding with a Resolution requesting the President to cause to be prepared by the Secretaries of State and the Navy, and reported to the house at the commencement of the next Session of Congress, a plan of such a line of Steamers in the joint-expence and co-operation of the Governments of the United States, with estimates of the expense which would be necessary for carrying the plan into execution.— There was some difficulty in obtaining the reception of the report; and afterwards to the consideration of the Resolution, but the objections were finally withdrawn, and the resolution was adopted. Cushing and Stuart made also the reports with which they were charged from the committee of foreign affairs— Arnold next called up his bill to curtail the pay and mileage of members of Congress. W. B. Campbell had moved to reconsider the vote of engrossment, and now made a rambling hour speech in favour of the bill, and then withdrew his motion to reconsider— After some confusion Shields renewed the motion to reconsider—and to commit the bill with instructions, forming his budget of retrenchment— Proffit moved the previous question, and while that was pending Shields claimed the question on his motion to reconsider. Fillmore objected to this as not in order.— The Speaker decided it was in order, from which Fillmore appealed, and after long discussion his decision was sustained by the house 143 to 34.— A motion to lay the reconsideration on the table, rejected— Reconsideration finally carried 86 to 82. Then more discussion, and half a dozen sets of instructions moved by different members, each utterly averse to the motions of all the others— At last the motion to refer the bill to a select Committee of 9 members— It was half past three O’Clock— I intreated them to take up a number of Bills from the Senate, which had come in this morning; and Fillmore proposed to take up the Navy Appropriation bill, returned with disagreements, and a request for a conference—but Botts moved to adjourn and it was carried. I went to the chamber of the Committee of Foreign Affairs and remained there till 5. and then walked till I met Thomas with the Barouche.

Fillmore moved to insist on the houses former votes, and to agree to the conference— Cave Johnson moved to adhere to the house votes and refuse the conference— A captious question arose which of the questions to insist or to adhere should be first put— I warmly adjured Cave Johnson to withdraw his motion to adhere, and in courtesy to the Senate to agree to the conference, but he declined— The vote to insist and agree to the conference was however carried.— Joseph R. Ingersoll then moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the general contingency appropriation Bill— Carried— Atherton in the chair. The committee immediately fell again foul of the retrenchment monsoon. Cave Johnson cavill’d at every new clerkship to be legalized for any one of the departments, till I advised him to beware of using the retrenching knife too freely—as he and his friends would themselves have the appoints to make in the next Congress— He resisted also the appropriation of Salaries for the Consul at London, and for a dragoman at Constantinople— I explained the reason for the allowance to the Consul and testified to the merit of the Consul Aspinwall. Cave Johnson’s motion to strike out this item was voted down without a division—the bill was worried through the Committee with sundry amendments, and reported to the house about 5. O’Clock when the house adjourned— Charles Brown, brought and delivered to me an invitation from a Temperance Society at Moyamensing to deliver before them an address on the life and character of John Hancock. He had evening visits from Mrs Elliot with Mr and Mrs Harrington, and Mrs Oldfield. The two latter Ladies, grand-daughters of judge Chase. "

I attended at the chamber of the Committee of foreign affairs, but only two other members of the Committee attended—Caruthers and Stuart— Absent Cushing, Everett Granger, Meriwether, Shepperd and White— No Quorum. In the house, sundry reports of Committees were received and among them by James Cooper, chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, on the Answer from the Secretary of War, refusing the papers called for by a Resolution of the house, and disclosing gross and fraudulent abuses in transactions with the Cherokee Indians— The report and Resolutions assert in forcible terms, the right of the house to demand the papers, and the final Resolution contains a call upon the President for them— Upon the reading of the report, the house began to heave convulsively with the agonies of the Tylerizing corporal’s guard, and their sympathising democracy— Manifested chiefly by Proffit, and by Gwin of Mississippi— Their objects were 1. to refuse reception both to the report and the resolutions. 2. to prevent their being printed; and 3. to smother all debate upon them— So they objected to the reception, but were overruled by the Speaker— They resisted the printing, upon the pretence that they wanted to debate the Resolutions, by which they hoped it would be laid over to another day and then never come up again. To meet and overreach these tactics Cooper was obliged to make two motions, and demand the previous question upon both at once 1. to print and 2. to adopt the Resolutions— Proffit sputtered and snapped like parched corn—denied the right of Cooper to offer two motions at once and call the previous question upon both— The Speaker decided that he had— Proffit moved to lay the whole subject on the table—yeas and nays 58 to 101—previous question carried 72 to 59. yeas and nays on the printing 92 to 67. Proffit then instantly moved the orders of the day— Cooper then offered to withdraw the previous question, upon the motion to adopt the Resolutions, but this he had no right to do— But the hour had expired, and Cowen chairman of the committee of claims, insisted upon the orders of the day—private business. After some struggle this was carried by yeas and nays 100 to 58. Committee of the whole on private bills— William Smith of Virginia in the Chair— Sundry bills were discussed and debated till 6. O’Clock with about 20 members within the bar, and about 30 without, at the windows— Adjourned at 6.— Evening visits from Loring B. True, and John Connell. True has been a school-teacher and is labouring for a place— I promised Cushing to bathe with him in the Potowmac to morrow morning— "

Mr Cushing went with me this morning and we took a short bath and swim in the Potowmac— This exercise formerly so delightful, and I had reason for so many years healthful to me has of late years been followed by accidents of disease, which I am compelled to take as warnings, that however suited to youth and manhood, there is an interdict upon it in old age— My old friend Dr Waterhouse, four or five years ago, as a physician dissuaded me from continuing to use it— I have from year to year since then discontinued it almost entirely— Last summer I was tempted to resume it, till it covered me with blisters, and put me for three weeks under the care of Dr Bigelow at Boston— Under all the temptations of a scorching atmosphere, for the last three weeks I have stood firm in resistance till yesterday, when Mr Cushing enquired of me, where I had been in the habit of bathing— In the house—the select committee to which Arnold’s bill for reducing the pay and mileage of members of Congress, and the Salaries of executive officers, reported back his bill with slight modifications, with a minority report and a substitute Bill, confined in its operation, to the members of Congress; and now there was a good deal of trouble about what to do with the bill, some being intensely desirous, as they have been from the hour of its introduction per saltum, without rhyme or reason, and others panting for a chance of chattering upon a retrenchment scheme of his own, and each one inflexibly opposed to every other than his own— Upwards of fifty members have taken part in this debate, and not one has discussed it with one spark of the reason and justice, appropriate to the subject. The bills and counterreport were finally ordered to be printed and referred to the Committee of the whole house on the state of the Union— Sundry private Bills were debated, and two or three fair pension claims, were defeated by the canker’d niggardliness of Mallory of Norfolk— The Committee on conference upon the disagreeing votes between the two houses on the navy appropriation bill; Wise, M’Kay and William B. Campbell, reported a compromise, by which the Senate yielded almost the whole that was in contest, and especially all that I had resisted; Wise had refused to agree to it in joint committee, but made the report, and moved its acceptance by the house Cave Johnson recalcitrated, but without effect— Both houses accepted the report and the bill is passed— Joseph R. Ingersoll had brought up the contingent appropriation bill, at the 3d. reading— Gentry began a long prepared set speech against the bill—but soon moved to adjourn— Ingersoll called the yeas and nays but Arnold was in the chair and declared the house adjourned.

Sunday  I attended with my wife this morning at the hall of the house of Representatives, and heard Mr Maffitt deliver his long announced funeral eulogy upon the late chaplain George M. Cookman. The house and galleries were crowded almost to suffocation— There was a numerous representation of singers from the methodist churches who began with the Anthem of [“]the dying christian to his soul”— [“]Vital spark of heavenly flame”— Then Mr Maffitt gave out Watts’s 100th. psalm, “Before Jehovah’s awful throne” as a hymn, and at the close of the discourse he gave out a long hymn of his own composition— He was an hour and a quarter in delivering the Eulogy—the first three quarters of an hour moderate, rational eloquent and even pathetic—glowing but not gorgeous—imaginative, but not fantastical— The last half hour was an agonizing abortion of the sublime flashy and trashy, laborious and impotent.— He still commanded universal attention till his last word, but he drew not a single tear.— He announced that he should deliver the same discourse this Evening at the Wesleyan Methodist chapel; and that at 4. O’Clock this afternoon he should preach a charity sermon at another church in this city— He said that ever since he was honoured with the appointment of chaplain to the house of representatives he had felt an ardent desire to deliver this funeral eulogy, and he wished to have it printed to offer it as a tribute of affectionate consolation to Mrs Cookman, and if any gentleman inclined to subscribe for any number of copies he would please to leave his name at Mr Tucker’s.— The text of the Eulogy was Revelation 14.13. “And I heard a voice from Heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours: and their works do follow them.”— The notices of Mr Cookman’s life, were of no uncommon nor yet of uninteresting events.— He was born at Hull in England in 1800 one of four sons of a Wesleyian Minister there. He had been in this Country since the year 1825. and had resided at several successive stations at various places two or three years at a time.— A fresh breeze had blown with a clear sky all day yesterday and all last night— This day it gathered in clouds and fell in showers, but in an interval I attended the evening service at St. Johns church. Mr Hawley read the prayers for the 10th Sunday after Trinity and preached from Acts 5.41. [“]And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. 42. and daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.”— After Church, I went over and spent an hour with Mr Thomas B. Johnson. When I came home I found Mr and Mrs Lawrence had been here to take leave "

Monday—  Maher is the gardener of the Capitol and the public grounds, extending to those round the President’s house where Ousely is only the kitchen gardener— Maher came to me this morning complaining that Mr Stanley had been deceived by misrepresentations, and thus induced to charge him with abusive expenditures on the public grounds— Stanly had attacked him, he said, two years ago, but Governor Lincoln then chairman of the Committee on the public buildings had defended him— Mr Stanley now renewed the attack; and he had lost his friend Governor Lincoln— He explained to me some of the facts alluded to one day last week by Stanley, who yields too much to his indignation at the plunder of the public, the incurable vice of all the departments of governments, and for some petty, perhaps inconsiderate over charges, said there was no part of the public expenses more corruptly managed than those of the public gardener.— I believe this is unjust—but I despair of convincing Stanley— Mr Babbitt came too this morning—urging me to call up the French spoliation bill: and he brought me a second list of members, marked, shewing a majority of the house in favour of taking up and of passing the bill— At the house Bowne of New-York made a ridiculous attempt to turn Arnold’s over-hasty adjournment of the house into a grave misdemeanor to be entered formally upon the journal— It was a mere inadvertence of no importance whatever in as much as the house was in a state of dissolution, not 50 members within the bar— Bowne raised a squall, but it soon passed away; and his motion to amend the journal was laid on the table by yeas and nays 97 to 87. Some question arose as to what business was to be taken up— The Speaker said it was petition day and Cushing presented one petition— Pendleton proposed to present a report from the military committee, to which Proffit objected. The contingent appropriation bill was taken up— Gentry resumed his speech and concluded it, to which Joseph R Ingersoll replied—debate followed and the engrossment of the bill was carried by yeas and nays 91 to 78. and afterwards with the help of the previous question was passed— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. I moved to take up the French spoliation bill, ayes 51. Stanly moved to take up the Senate’s bill for reorganizing the army, which was carried.— Cave Johnson moved a substitute, beginning by a repeal of the act of 1838 increasing the army—after long debate the Committee rose— I offered a call on the Secretaries of War and the Navy for returns of the number of coloured persons enlisted or employed in the Army or Navy. Carried against some resistance from the South— Adjourned at 5— Walk after dinner.— Evening cold— Mrs Smith dined out. "

In the house Nathaniel G. Pendleton of Ohio, asked leave to present a report from a select committee, on an iron steamer constructed on one of the Northern lakes— Proffit objected to its reception; charging the whigs with bringing indictment after indictment, against the President—poisoning the public mind; but without ever calling any of them up— I immediately moved to take up my report and resolution upon the message announcing the deposit at the department of State of the President’s reasons for signing the apportionment bill— R. M. Saunders objected— I moved a suspension of the rules— Proffit, Cushing and W. W. Irwin voted for it but the whole democracy voted against it—the yeas and nays were 93 to 66—not two thirds,— So James Cooper’s report and resolutions upon the Secretary of War’s refusal to send papers called for by a resolution of the house was taken up for the morning hour. Gwin of Mississippi and Cushing made speeches against the reported Resolutions— Gwin is a repudiator— Cushing has no moral principle; and would have been a Prodicus or a Gorgias, at Athens in the days of Socrates— He has indefatigable industry, burning ambition, a subtle and a daring spirit, an infidel in religion, with a system of morals founded on the code of honour and expediency, cautious and crafty, with an active mind full of undigested knowledge, a captious intellect, and a treacherous heart—his speech this morning was interrupted by the expiration of the morning hour— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Fessenden in the chair— Senate Bill for reorganizing the army, debated by Barton, Sprigg, Goggin, W. B. Calhoun, and Ward. When the Committee rose Stanly moved to take the bill out of Committee at 3. O’Clock to morrow— Cave Johnson pleaded for ten minute indulgences to explain; but Stanly was inexorable and the resolution was adopted.— Evening visitors, the names in the margin. Coll.

Proffit replied that he never was more serious in his life—for the army was to be sacrificed and destroyed, and he had foreseen its fate from the day that I had declared my purpose to reduce it— Proffit abandoned his motion; little imagining what a dose of wormwood he was administering to Captain Tyler and his democratic allies by imputing the reduction of the army to me— Cave Johnson’s substitute for the whole bill was then taken up— I moved the reduction of the rank and file in all the regiments from 50 to 42 and instead of disbanding the 8th. regiment of infantry and authorizing the President to form a regiment of mounted riflemen, to continue the regiment of infantry, and have no mounted riflemen. At 3. O’Clock, the voting began, upon the amendments—the bill was made to conform entirely conformable to my views so far as related to the reduction of the army, and was reported to the house. Cave Johnson moved to lay it on the table—rejected 55 to 115— Stanly moved the previous question, which was ordered, and the house then adjourned.— Cushing made a very animated speech against the reduction of the army. Meriwether and Gilmer have disappeared— Wise when his name was called said he did not know how to vote— Evening visit from Mr Connell. "

Appleton somewhat excited said that the judge’s opinion was the unanimous opinion of all our friends at home— I said I was sorry for it, but could not help it— But I see the whigs will finally flinch, for the sake of a tariff, and will surrender forever the public lands— I had yesterday a conversation with Speaker White in his chamber, on this subject in consequence of a Letter which he had delivered to me from H. Clay, who earnestly urges me to take the lead in the approaching crisis— And Richard W. Thompson came to me this day, and urged me to attend a meeting of a committee of 21 members one from each whig State, to consider what is to be done, when the veto of the tariff will come.

Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Present Adams, Cushing, Caruthers, Everett, Stuart, White— Absent, Meriwether, Granger and Shepperd. Mr Cushing’s bill, for requiring annual reports from the Secretary of State of changes in the commercial regulations of foreign countries, introduced by him into the house yesterday and referred to the Committee, was discussed and amended, and he was authorized to report it to the house— He was not ready with a report on the petitions of Dr Baldwin, and Aaron Leggett; in addition to which I proposed to take into consideration the claim of the ex-marquis Attellis de Santangelo— The whole subject of our political relations with Mexico, with Texas, and with Great-Britain was brought into discussion, and particularly the debts of the States and Territories, and the liabilities in which they may involve the Nation— We continued the debate until the house had been half an hour in Session— I found James Cooper speaking on the Resolution reported by him from the Committee of Indian Affairs of the right of the house to call for papers, and the answer of the Secretary of War, declining to send the papers called for— He finished his hour, and Mr Everett followed, offering an amendment as a substitute for the three resolutions: merely that the reasons of the Secretary of War for declining to send the papers are not satisfactory— He made a very short speech in support of his motion.— When he closed the question was about to be taken— Just before, I had been called out of my seat, by judge Swymmer from St. John’s New Brunswick, who reminded me that he had visited me, when I was in that city, in September 1840.— I introduced him on the floor of the house, and was talking with him when Cooper came, and urged me to say a few words upon the question, which was about to be taken— I returned to my seat, and spoke 27 minutes till the expiration of the morning hour. Committee of the whole, Boardman of Connecticut in the Chair, upon the Calendar of private Bills, and this being the first Friday of the month no bills could be acted upon, but those upon which there was to be no debate— 121 Bills of the house and perhaps 30 Senate bills were reported to the house without objection or with objections withdrawn; about 70 were laid aside as debateable, and upwards of 20 were reported with recommendation that they should be rejected— The whole Calendar was gone through— William Smith objected to the bill for the relief of Joseph Holmes and the owners of the Schooner Industry, but withdrew the objection at my solicitation— Stanly did the same, on the bill for the relief of Alexander H. Everett— Adjourned at 5. In the evening I went to a party at General Jesup’s, where the children performed, Miss Edgeworth’s old poz. William Miles here— The Senate passed the Tariff-bill 25 to 23— "

Gave a sitting from 9 to 10 to Mr Beard— His progress hitherto is not encouraging— It is the most hideous caricature that I ever beheld— At the house after a full half hour of obtrusions as usual of business out of order and out of time, the Speaker announced James Cooper’s resolutions from the Committee of Indian affairs, with Everett’s proposed amendment as the business of the morning; and that I had the floor— I enquired what time I had left to complete my hour—he said 33 minutes— I am confident it was at least ten minutes more, but I lost my time by not marking it myself— I said I was very desirous of abridging the time in which I should be compelled to trespass on the indulgence of the house; and there was a contingency which might happen before Monday Morning, and which would render a very large portion, of what otherwise I must say, altogether unnecessary. I meant the signing by the President of the Tariff bill— I said I would therefore move the postponement till Monday Morning of Cooper’s Resolutions, and to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the French spoliation claim bill.— The Speaker said it was not in order to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up any particular bill. I then moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, generally: but not more than 50 members rose in the affirmative.— So I was obliged to proceed, in a defence of Congress against a violent charge by Cushing that they must fulfil their destiny, which is to prostrate the Government of the United States, to be resuscitated and restored by our successors. I had not proceeded 3 minutes before Bowne raised a point of order; that no answer can be made in the house to what has been said in committee of the whole— The Speaker said that was the rule; but that Cushing had been very liberally indulged in the remarks upon which I was animadverting, and Cushing himself reminded Bowne, that I could put it as a supposed case, and it was of no use to attempt to arrest me and he was ready to meet whatever I have to say— I proceeded but had barely reached the threshold of my subject when the fragment of my hour expired, and Proffit was upon the floor while I was in the midst of a sentence— He replied to me, till the expiration of the morning hour, and has another half hour in reserve for Monday— Committee of the whole upon private bills Boardman in the chair— A Bill for the relief of Michael Sullivan was testily debated between Medill, Patrick G. Goode Samson Mason, and Cowen, and finally laid aside— The bill repaying 1000 dollars to Captain Allyn for bringing over Genl. La Fayette— Objection was made to this Bill— No Quorum. Committee rose and reported the fact. I moved a call of the house—carried—but before a quorum answered, Holmes moved to adjourn at 3.— Adjourned— Music on the President’s grounds— Call at R. Cutts’s.

On returning last evening from hearing the music of the Marine corps band, passing by Mr Cutts’s house, he was sitting with Mrs Madison at the window, and his daughter Mary standing with Anna Payne at the door invited me in— I went in accordingly, and had half an hour of chat with them, till Mrs Madison left, to return home.— After the adjournment of the house yesterday, I went to the chamber of the Committee of foreign Affairs, to write till 5. when I had ordered Thomas to come for me with the Barouche— I found Underwood there writing who told me he was waiting to meet a Committee there at 6. O’Clock— This morning I attended alone at the Hall of the house of Representatives where Mr Tustin preached from Matthew 12.31. “Wherefore I say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven, unto men: but the blasphemy against the holy Ghost shall not be forgiven 32. And whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost, it shall not be forgiven him; neither in this world, neither in the world to come.” A discourse upon the unpardonable sin— A subject much beyond the powers of the preacher.— He treated it very feebly— There is not perhaps in all the Scriptures a subject of more difficulty and delicacy. There is a learned and ingenious Sermon of Saurin in which it is discussed with all his ability. Mr Tustin’s auditory did not exceed 100 persons— The chief and perhaps insuperable difficulty of discoursing on the unpardonable sin is to ascertain what it is— The prevalent opinion that it is the crime of imputing to an evil spirit the operations of the Spirit of God is very unsatisfactory to me. Mr Tustin adopted it without controversy— There is some plausibility in this opinion, countenanced by collation with other passages, but it is all inferential. Notwithstanding this dreadful denuntiation against the sin, it is not explicitly said what the sin is, and I incline much to doubt whether the text itself is not an interpolation of the unhappy and fatal effect it has produced upon the weakness of multitudes in the fear that they had unconsciously committed this sin without knowing what it was. Mr Tustin said nothing— He exhorted affectionately his hearers to great caution by fulfilling all their duties, to avoid the possibility of committing it, and assured them, that with such caution they would never be in danger of committing it— After dinner at St. John’s Church a stranger read the service for the 11th Sunday after Trinity and preached from 1. Corinthians 1.22. [“]For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom 23. But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness. 24. But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.” Mr Hawley said he should be 2 Sundays absent. "

At the house— Resolution day. Ohio called Samson Mason offered a joint resolution to adjourn the two houses on Monday the 22d of this month at 2. O’Clock P.M. which passed by acclamation— A resolution passed by yeas and nays 90 to 74. to furnish the new members with books which have been furnished to the old members— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the contested election bill— Fessenden in the chair— I had taken some part in the discussion upon the first and second Sections, of the bill; but the debate immediately ran into party bitterness, and I resolved to withdraw myself from it altogether— A multitude of amendments were proposed and rejected. others, proposed by Halsted, chairman of the Committee of elections, were adopted—among which was one forbidding the clerk of the house to enter on the list of persons presenting themselves as members of the House of Representatives at the commencement of any Congress, anyone elected otherwise than as a Representative of a single district.— Fessenden left the chair to speak to an amendment, and Briggs took his place— When the bill was reported to the house John Campbell moved its recommitment of the bill with instructions to report two small amendments; but Halsted moved and insisted upon the previous question which was carried.— The single district section was carried by yeas and nays 99 to 79. and the bill 99 to 82. The report of the Committee of Conference on the army organization bill was then taken up and after some debate it was found that it must be referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, which was done with an order to print the Bill with the report of the Committee of Conference and the army appropriation bill with the report of the Committee of the conference upon that— Sundry territorial bills followed; and then a resolution offered by Sherlock J. Andrews, to rescind the vote of censure upon Giddings.— The other Andrews objected and the house adjourned. When I came home I found Mrs Treadway, and her daughter Mrs Crane here, and Mrs Smith going to Mr Frye’s— The five members of the house of Representatives, and Mr and Mrs Roosevelt were evening visitors till 11 at night.

W. Cost Johnson presented as second memorial from Pennsylvania, praying for an appropriation of 200000000. of acres of the public Lands to be distributed among the States to enable them to pay their debts.— He moved to refer the memorial to a select Committee, and asked the yeas and nays.— Morgan moved its reference to the Committee of Ways an Means— Charles Brown bristled up with scorn and indignation at the idea that Pennsylvania should receive any aid from the general Government—and chuckled in bragging that there was no member from Pennsylvania, who would present and advocate such a memorial— Toland asked him if he meant to say that he would not present such a memorial if it should be sent to him— Brown dodged the question, by enquiring if Toland would present and advocate such a memorial. Toland said he would present but not support it—the time not being yet come. Cooper’s Resolutions on the Secretary of War’s report declining to communicate papers called for by the house employed the morning hour— Proffit finished his hour of scolding at me— And Cushing fired his broadside also at me— Fillmore then moved the previous question, and said there was a message from the President— At the request of Caruthers, who said he wished to address the house on the question, and pledged himself to renew the question— The morning hour was expired— The Message was a Veto of the Tariff-bill sent to the President last Saturday.— Fillmore moved that the Message should be entered on the journal, and printed, and the considera be postponed till to morrow, and moved the previous question, all which was carried— The report of the Committee of Conference on the army organization bill, was after long debate rejected and a vote to ask another conference was carried— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, John C.

IV:45 Wednesday  I had been solicited and urged from various quarters of the house to take the lead of the measures to be adopted by the house on the reception of the veto message; and yesterday while the house was in committee of the whole, the Speaker came to my seat, and asked me to call in at his chamber, for a few minutes after the adjournment of the house, which I did. he then again urged me to address the house on the reconsideration of the tariff bill— I said I would make a speech on the message, and conclude with a motion to refer the message to a select committee— I prepared last evening and this morning minutes for an hour speech, which I could have expanded at pleasure into a speech of two, three or even six or seven hours.— It is the first experiment of this that I have made since the establishment of the hour rule, and although now but partially successful, I am convinced it might by a younger man be improved into a powerful and most effective practise.— I called at 9 this morning, at Mr Beard’s painting room, and told him I had not leisure this day but would give him a sitting to-morrow morning— At the house I consumed the hour till the meeting in collecting the documents and my thoughts for the speech— After the preliminary intrusive matter the morning hour was well occupied with an excellent speech on Cooper’s Resolution from the Committee of Indian Affairs against the Secretary of War’s suppression of evidence— He then moved the previous question as he had promised Filmore to do— Weller the same man who moved the previous question to cut off Giddings from his right of self defence, remonstrated against the previous question after a party speech— Caruthers voted against his own motion but it was carried— The question was ordered but not taken, the hour having expired— The Speaker then announced the veto Message; I took the floor and compressed within one hour, brief and cursory remarks on all the topics which I had minuted for discussion.— It was not skilfully done; nor with any of the bursts of eloquence, which I have not the power to command— Its effect was far more visible upon my adversaries than upon my friends— I closed with a motion to refer the message to a select Committee of 13 members, with instructions to report thereon. Foster of Georgia started a question of order, denying the power of the house to refer to a Committee—what the Constitution required them to reconsider— And now commenced a scene of bullying and chicanery by Wise, Cushing, Proffit, and W. Cost Johnson, which lasted three hours and after laying on the table three appeals from the Speaker’s decisions my motion to refer was carried by yeas and nays 108 to 84. and the Bill was laid on the table by 97 to 73— Other business was transacted till near 6. p.m. when the house adjourned— I have neither time nor space to note particulars— Mrs Thornton was here this evening.

At the house, the journal was amended on my motion—it had stated that my motion yesterday to refer to the select committee was the objections of the President to the tariff bill— My motion was to refer the message— The committee announced were Adams, Jeremiah Morrow, Francis Granger, Truman Smith, John Minor Botts, James K. Pearce, Kenneth Rayner, James Cooper, Thomas J. Campbell, Thomas W Gilmer, W. W. Irwin, James I. Roosevelt, and Charles J. Ingersoll— Cave Johnson moved a Resolution calling on the Secretary of War for a list of the officers of the army who have resigned since 1834. Stanly objected, but Cave moved and carried a suspension of the rules, and the call was adopted, with an addition afterwards of the officers educated at West Point— A Senate bill for altering the judicial circuits was then taken up, and after some debate was passed by yeas and nays 115 to 68. I voted against it, because it will prevent a more general and entire revisal and new organization of all the circuits— Proffit moved to take up the vetoed Tariff bill, and called the yeas and nays which were 82 to 104. I moved that the report and Resolution upon the apportionment bill message, be referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the union— Cushing objected— And the Speaker decided that the Report having been laid on the table could be taken up only by vote of two thirds— I then moved to suspend the rules to present my resolution, and called the yeas and nays—they were 95 to 80— A majority but not two thirds— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, George W. Hopkins in the Chair on the fortification appropriation bill, which was warmly debated for about 3 hours when Graham of North-Carolina, moved to report the Bill with a recommendation that it be rejected.— Cushing took the opportunity to make a cut and thrust speech at me to which I made a very short reply. Bowne made a furious speech against the whigs, which Fillmore blew up by an instantaneos answer— I personally notified all the members of the select Committee on the veto message to meet at 9 to-morrow morning in the chamber of the Committee of foreign Affairs. W. W. Irwin with a strut of the mock heroic, asked to be excused from serving on the select veto committee, because the appointment of a committee was unconstitutional, the constitution requiring that the house should reconsider the bill. A full hour was spent upon this balderdash, till Irwin was excused— Mr and Mrs Johnson are from Philadelphia— She originally from Medfield.   "

Ingersoll, and Roosevelt—11 members— Absent—Thomas J Campbell from indisposition. he had told me yesterday that he should probably not be able to come— I proposed to the Committee to authorize me to prepare a report, and to indulge me till next Monday morning to have it ready to be submitted to the Committee— There was a desultory conversation till the time of meeting of the house, upon the views and topics proper to be presented in the report. Ingersoll, Gilmer and Roosevelt, voters against the reference to the Committee, were readily for allowing me till Monday to prepare the Report, but said they would need a similar indulgence of reasonable time afterwards to prepare a minority report which was agreed to. They manifested some curiosity to know to what conclusion my report would come; but I said I had not sufficiently meditated that. Negatively I would assure them I should not close with Articles of impeachment— Roosevelt enquired if the report could not conclude with a recommendation to pass another Tariff bill. I said it certainly could; but if that was the purpose of the Committee, I should request them to charge some other member with the preparation of the report— In the house W. Cost Johnson gave notice of his intention to ask leave to-morrow to introduce a sort of Salmagundi bill for revenue, for disposal of the public lands, and for constituting a funded stock of 200,000,000 of dollars to pay the debts of the States. W. Cost Johnson sees that the whigs have abandone him, and he is preparing himself, to pass over with his uniform and baggage to the corporal’s guard. Tom Marshall, Sprigg and John Pope are moving in the same direction M’Kennon by sheer dragging got up his bill making appropriations, for fixing the sites of 6 or 7. marine hospitals in the western waters— The bill was passed by yeas and nays 86 to 67. C. H. Williams moved a reconsideration to substitute, instead of a Napoleon in Arkansas, Memphis in Tennessee, for one of the sites—reconsideration carried 91 to 90. Then Williams’s amendment was rejected, and the bill was again carried—104 to 79. C. J. Ingersoll moved a suspension of the rules for him to introduce his bill to provide a revenue from imports. suspension of the rules refused 43 to 117— Irwin and Wise made speeches at me— Fortification bill laid on the table— Visits of Scofield and Davis, sugar refiners. H. van Rensselaer returned. "

I went to the Capitol at 9 this morning, and my niece Mrs Treadway’s daughter, Susan Maria Clark Crane, and my granddaughter Mary-Louisa, rode with me— I had promised a sitting to Mr Beard, and stop’d at his room, but he came out and said he was quite unwell and unable to work; so I agreed to defer the sitting till Monday—a convenience to me, oppressed as I was with the preparation of the report upon the veto message— I was obliged to work upon it during the sitting of the house—and could there give little attention to any thing else. R. M. T. Hunter presented an Anti-tariff memorial from Virginia Summers seized a moment of the mollia tempora fandi, and worried through the bill for the relief of William Willis— Barnard persuaded the house to discharge the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union from the new circuiting bill the object of which I understood from Botts was to deliver Virginia from the judicial authority of Daniel as the circuit judge— Barnard carried his motion by suspension of the rules and the bill was passed— Arnold bustled and blustered about his bill N. 548. to reduce the pay and mileage of members of Congress, but the principal incident of the day was the adoption of the 3. Resolutions reported by James Cooper from the Committee of Indian affairs, amended by Caruthers, on the report of the Secretary of War declining to send papers called for by resolution of the house— The amendment moved by Caruthers to the first Resolution was adopted—then Mr Everett’s substitute for the 3 resolutions was rejected 62 to 104— Then the first Resolution merely declaratory of the right of the house to call on the President or heads of Departments was carried 142 to 8. Cushing, Irwin and Proffit, being 3 of the 8— Wise asked to be excused from voting, because he could not vote against it as a general declaration, and could not vote for it without an implication of censure where he did not think it was deserved and he was excused— The second Resolution that the call was for papers relating to business before the house and should have been communicated was carried 93 to 64— For this Everett voted; but on the 1st. and 3d Resolutions did not vote— The third was a request to the President to cause the papers to be communicated to the house—carried 83 to 60—numerous dodgers on both sides— It is hardly conceivable, how many members start back at any approach to gall the kibe of the executive chief. There was a flare up, between Arnold and Fessenden, upon mutual charges of each against the other of being about to join the guard—retracted— Adjourned soon after 3— Heard the band on the President’s grounds— Heated and flushed with toil.

With Mrs John Adams, Mrs Susan Maria Clark Crane, and Mary-Louisa I attended public worship this morning at the hall of the house of representatives, where Mr Maffitt preached from Luke 10.42 [“]But one thing is needful; and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.” The one thing needful is religion— The house as is usual when Mr Maffit preaches was well filled— After closing his discourse, he sung by himself a short methodist hymn.— He gave notice that he should preach a charity Sermon this afternoon at Georgetown, observing that it had been by mistake announced for last Sunday. That he should preach again in that hall, probably for the last time— Mr Maffitt’s manner of preaching is exceedingly attractive, and yet very much censured— It is eminently theatrical—and although the theatre ought to be the best school of public speaking, there is a universal prejudice against the application of the very best manner of speaking on the stage to the pulpit— The impression always is that the preacher is acting a part— I believe this to be a prejudice, but am not free from it myself. Mr Maffitt’s manner of preaching, approaches the perfection of theatrical declamation— He preaches the love of God—obedience to his will—the love of our neighbour, benevolence, toleration, charity—all the Christian virtues and graces— He preaches the atonement in the blood of Jesus—the divinity of Christ—the trinity in unity of the Godhead, and the fall and redemption of man— He always commands intense interest and eloquent silence— He adverts too frequently and with too much complacency to himself— Upon the whole I always hear him—often with pleasure—sometimes I hope with profit—never to the detriment of moral principle, or of religious faith.— After the morning service, I had a visit from Benjamin, son of Richard Rush. There was no Church at St. Johns, and in the afternoon I attended, at the second Presbyterian church, and heard a stranger in the place of Mr Clark from Malachi 3.8. [“]Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me”— This was an objurgative discourse. Evening visits from Mr Mildmay one of Lord Ashburton’s Secretaries, who came to take leave and departs to-morrow, and from Dr Thomas— The whole of this day, save that portion of it devoted to the Sabbath and to visitors, has been oppressed even till the midnight hour with labour, in preparing the report on the tariff veto message to be presented to the select Committee of 13. to morrow morning.

                "text": "15— V. Monday—  I closed this morning the report on the Tariff veto bill just in time to meet the select Committee at 9. O’Clock— Every member was present J. Q. Adams, Jeremiah Morrow, Francis Granger, Truman Smith, John M. Botts, James H. Pearce, Kenneth Rayner, James Cooper, Thomas Jefferson Campbell, Thomas W. Gilmer, James I Roosevelt, Charles Jared Ingersoll, and Henry S. Lane— I read the Report and with two or three slight amendments I was authorised by nine members of the Committee to present it to the house. Mr Gilmer said he wished to present a counter report which he had partly written, but wished a short time to finish. It was agreed that he should present his report, at the same time when I should present mine.— I proposed to conclude with a Resolution to amend the constitution of the United States, so as to make a majority of the whole number of members of each house— Several members came to me and urged me to present the report this day, but Gilmer came and said he was very unwell, and obliged to go home and undergo an operation (for the piles) and asked me not to present my report till to morrow morning, which I promised— I went to Underwood for a set of proposed amendments, which he offered some months ago, among which this curb to the veto was one—he sent for his budget to his lodgings at Georgetown, and when it came I took from it the curtail of the veto, and drew up from it an Article of amendment in a few words— Botts had proposed in Committee another Resolution that the house have no confidence in Tyler or his administration; but I objected to it as offering a second and unnecessary issue; and he withdrew it. In the house there was a scramble for what bill should be taken up. W. Cost Johnson moved for a suspension of the rules to introduce his multitudinous bill—in vain— Arnold invoked his retrenchment bill N. 548. in vain— W. W. Irwin pronounced the name of the Cumberland road bill and was laughed at. D. D. Barnard got up a bill about remedial justice, by 79 to 76. but it was soon attacked by John G. Floyd, and Gordon, and laid on the table, whence it will never rise again— Sundry-bills reported from the Committee on naval affairs were piddled with an hour or two— Mr Wise even vociferating them up, without forcing progress upon any one of them. Mr Binda and his daughter Mary were here this Evening. "

As I was going out this morning, Mrs Royall’s Sally made me a visit after the usual manner for the subscription to her weekly paper the Huntress— This was the morning for the meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Only four members attended, Adams, Caruthers, White, Granger— No Quorum— Botts and Rayner of the Select Committee on the Veto message attended, supposing by mistake that a meeting of that Committee this morning had been appointed, at the adjournment yesterday— Botts said that he and other members of the majority of the Committee wished to sign their names to my Report; and he asked me to give him my original draught of the Report, signed by me, which I did, and he, James Cooper, Kenneth Rayner, Thomas J. Campbell, Truman Smith, Francis Granger, Henry S. Lane, Jeremiah Morrow and James S. Pearce, signed the Report and my original draught which Botts said he would keep as the second Declaration of Independence. At the Meeting of the House, after some intrusive business occupying about half an hour, I read in my seat the report signed by ten members of the Committee concluding with a Resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution— The reading took me just three quarters of an hour— Gilmer had announced his Report, and Charles J. Ingersoll now announced that he had a minority report signed by himself and Roosevelt Not a word of this was said, in Committee; but I made no objection to its reception— Gilmer read his report, which took an hour, and Ingersoll read his in 40 minutes— A great part of Gilmer’s was a Dissertation to prove the unconstitutionality of the appointment of the Committee, and of the proceedings of the Committee on the subject.— Ingersoll’s was a lampoon upon me in revenge for my blast upon his five points speech— After the reading I moved that the three Reports together with the Bill and Veto Message be printed and made the special order of the day for to-morrow at 12 O’Clock. Wise then immediately moved to take up the vetoed bill, which the house by yeas and nays 98 to 104 refused. Stanly then presented the report of the second Committee of Conference on the army organization Bill, which was accepted by the house in four several questions contrary to the usage and rule that the report of a committee of Conference cannot be amended. W. Cost Johnson offered his Bill with a title half a yard long, and asked the yeas and nays on its being referred to a select Committee and printed. They were 8 to 122. I was one of the minority— Barnard moved to take the remedial Justice bill out of Committee in two hours—and moved the previous question— Bowne moved to adjourn carried. Maher here full of his grievances— J. J. Crittenden here. "

At the meeting of the house this morning M’Kennan moved the suspension of the rules to introduce a resolution that it is expedient to pass another revenue bill, the same with the one just vetoed with the exception of the 27th. Section, containing the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public Lands, and exempting tea and Coffee from all duty— After much agitation, the question was taken by yeas and nays 108 to 85 not two thirds—but the numerical majority was in favour of the measure and it was clear by the result that it will be carried. Next Charles Brown, moved a suspension of the rules to offer a resolution to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up house bill N. 547 to supply a temporary defect or failure in the laws relating to the collection of duties on imports, The yeas and nays on the question of suspending the rules were 113 to 81— Fillmore moved a reconsideration of the vote refusing to reconsider, and this was carried by a majority less than two thirds 130 to 70. and then the motion to suspend the rules was again lost, by an increased majority 122 to 72.— Noon had come; and I called for the special order of the day. W. Cost Johnson claimed as a privileged right the motion to take up the vetoed tariff bill: and the Speaker recognized his right. I moved to lay his motion on the table, but the house refused. They took up the bill— Cost Johnson made his speech and urged his creation of two hundred millions of United States, 4 per cent stocks, to pay the debts of the States, and to be redeemed by the proceeds of the sales of the public lands— When he finished Arnold moved the previous question on the passage of bill, and it was taken as prescribed by the Constitution 91 to 87. the same majority by which it originally passed in the house— My report and Resolution then came up—the Report was adopted by yeas and nays 100 to 80. The Resolution lost by 98 to 90— Marshall moved a re-consideration of the last vote—made an hour speech against it, and withdrew his motion— Wise moved a reconsideration— Spoke half an hour of invective against me, and then at Cushing’s motion the house adjourned. It was at the request of Botts that I modified my motion to include the adoption of the report— I told Botts, the majority of the house would not vote to adopt the report— He said they would, and they did— My wife had an evening party of Mrs Madison and other friends as above— Susan M.

Going up this morning to give a sitting to Mr Beard before the Meeting of the house I called in at Keyworth the jeweller’s shop and settled with him a small bill. He appeared much gratified to see me; introduced me to Mrs Keyworth, and as if in kind and gentle reproach, said he believed it was the first time I had ever entered his shop, and it was true. The remark put me upon self enquiry why it was; and the answer was an aversion to jewellers’ shops as scenes of temptation— Always pinched with want of money to pay for the necessaries of life, and bear up under the daily burdens of the household, I never have a superfluous dollar to offer in jewels or even trinkets to my friends— I have no time now to enlarge upon this topic as I might. A son of William Brent was with Mr Beard, and was also at work with the pallet. It was half past two when I reached the house, and I found Wise on the floor finishing his hour invective not only upon me— But the majority of the select committee and the house. He was followed by Kenneth Rayner, a spirit as fiery as his own, who began by making Wise disclaim all personal application in his bullying defiances, and lashed him with scorpions for an hour— Garrett Davis, Arnold, Colquit, continued the debate till Granger moved the previous question, upon which I said that the house would see what claim of Justice I had for reply, to personal assaults from various quarters; but I would rather than occupy the time of the house forbear to assert the claim, and acquiesce in the previous question— It was carried, and the reconsideration rejected 14 to 140. Fillmore then moved that the Committees be called for Reports I asked that the Report on the Quasi-veto, apportionment bill message should be taken up— Cushing objected— Fillmore from the Committee of Ways and Means reported a Resolution, instructing that Committee to report speedily another Revenue bill, the same as the one just vetoed, excepting the 27th. Section, and making Tea and Coffee duty free— This is the same project presented yesterday by Mr M’Kennon— Botts moved to lay it on the table—lost 73 to 103— Fillmore moved a call of the house carried—200 members answered— Holmes objected that the Committee of Ways and Means were not authorised to offer this resolution, but the Speaker overruled the objection— Hays asked a division of the question, first including only the title of the bill; but the Speaker pronounced the whole resolution indivisible. Hays appealed, but on the motion of M’Kennon the appeal was laid on the table. The vote was at last taken and the motion was lost 86 to 114. Many of the members on both sides withheld their votes at the call of their names; but Wise called for compulsory process, upon them and they were all compelled to vote— Gilmer and Fillmore being of the number both of whom and Wise voted no— W. W. Irwin immediately started up, and moved a suspension of the rules, to introduce another Tariff bill, but Botts moved to adjourn—carried 110 to 80— I went and dined with John P. Kennedy at his lodgings—Appleton—Granger, Saltonstall and Hudson there— Whig Caucusing. "

The position that I have taken is arduous enough to crush any man in the vigour of youth; but at 75 with failing senses, and blunted instruments surrounded by remorseless enemies and false and scary and treacherous friends, how can it end but in my ruin?— But I must meet the shock— Mr Thompson called on me this morning to say that the Messenger from Mexico had arrived, so that in the course of another day to two, Committee of foreign Affairs would receive information upon which they can decide what to do. Mr Thompson spoke also of the compensation to be fixed by one of the navy appropriation bills for the engineers employed in the armed steamers, among whom he has one Son— Mr John Connell was also here, and thought this was a time for me to come forward as a mediator of a compromise between the parties, and to surrender the public lands, for a protective tariff— This is precisely what is called the Pennsylvania platform, of which we had a surfeit this day in the house— My visitors made me tardy at the Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs— I found a Quorum assembled— Caruthers, Cushing, Granger, Stuart and White— Absent Meriwether, who has gone home— Shepperd, who has ceased attending the Committee from indisposition, and Everett, who is busy, jobbing with Charles Ingersoll for a Tariff without distribution and with Tea and coffee free.— The Committee had taken up no business and Cushing had asked time till the next Meeting if there should be one to report on the Mexican claims— In the house the day was consumed in a struggle, of divided parties for a tariff, and surrender of the lands— John Campbell began with a project of a 20 per cent tariff, with tea and coffee and an excise on gold and silver.

Ingersoll in the Chair, and the Committee took up Barnard’s bill from the judiciary Committee to supply a defect in the revenue Laws— C. J. Ingersoll moved his bill, as an entire substitute— W. Cost Johnson moved his bill, as an entire substitute— Barnard moved an amendment to save penalties.— I made a short hour speech against the amendment and against the bill; contending that no tariff bill ought to pass at this time— Proffit and Cushing replied to me—wormwood and gall. Granger chastised Cushing, and skirmished with Wise— Thompson of Indiana lashed Cushing— M’Kennon blew hot and cold, and T. F. Marshall took formal leave of the whig party, from which he said he had been yesterday expelled— "

My wife was somewhat suddenly afflicted with a sore throat and hoarse dry cough which in the course of the night became so severe and alarming that I was roused from bed and called up Mrs Goods, who applied a poultice round the throat— It was half past 9. when I reached the Painter’s room. Wise was there when I went, in but immediately retired— Young Brent lent me a number of the Democratic Review to shew me an Article on the Supreme Court of the United States in Jany 1838. I found the house in Session after an altercation between W. Cost Johnson, and Bidlack, about certain petitions purporting to come from Pennsylvania and presented by Johnson— Bidlack had questioned the genuineness of the Petitions, which were for Johnson’s utopian creation of 200000000 of stocks, to be issued at 4 per cent interest, to be redeemed by an equal number of acres of the public lands.— I found the house debating, amendments to a bill relating to the District of Columbia returned from the Senate, with amendments— The debate so animated yesterday upon Barnard’s Bill to amend a defect in the revenue laws, was not resumed this day— It was suspended by general consent, and the present project of the whigs is to carry the bill reported by Fillmore from the Committee of Ways and Means, as an Amendment to Barnard’s Bill, and some of them delude themselves with the belief that they will finally reject that— But a Tariff they must and will have.— Now the house concurred in an amendment of the Senate to the Bill for establishing a police in the city of Washington— An amendment of the Senate was also concurred in extending the benefits of the pension acts of 1836 and 1838 to certain widows— Fillmore moved a Resolution to take the contingent appropriation bill out of the Committee at 3 O’Clock this afternoon— A multitude of Reports from Committees were received and acted upon— Arnold attempted to introduce a Resolution to take his retrenchment bill out of Committee on Monday, but he could not obtain a hearing— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Alexander H. H. Stuart in the Chair— The contingent appropriation bill had been returned from the Senate with numerous amendments some of which were adopted and others rejected.— At 3. O’Clock the voting commenced on the amendments and it was very tedious and quite unintelligible— Fillmore read a Letter from M’Clintock Young acting Secretary of the Treasury stating the forlorn condition of that office and praying for funds to meet arrearages— Referred to the Committee of Ways and Means.— Adjourned about 4. Mr James Bradford formerly of Louisiana, now of Ohio visited me this evening to play chess but Miss Cutts and Miss Payne took me to R. Cutts’s. "

                "text": "21. V:15 Sunday  There was a small party last Evening at Mr Cutts’s where our Ladies were (except my wife who was better, but still confined to her chamber[)], when Miss Cutts and Miss Payne came and invited me to join them— I went accordingly and found there Mr and Mrs Poindexter, Mrs Madison and two or three others— Poindexter, on my going in immediately rose and with his wife, went away— They had been playing whist, and I took his place for one game with Mrs. Madison, Mr Cutts and Henry Van Rensselaer, the member of the house— Dr Thomas came in, and told us, that the Senate had this evening advised and consented to the ratification of the Conventions (two) with Lord Ashburnham, and that he had seen them on the President’s table.— This morning Mrs Oldfield, a daughter of Commodore Barney and granddaughter of judge Samuel Chase, who is lodging at Mrs Smoot’s opposite our house sent to enquire if I would give her a seat in my Carriage to go and hear Mr Maffit at the Capitol.— This request could not of course be denied— With Mrs John Adams, Mrs Treadway and myself she went to the Representative Hall where the Chaplain of the house delivered his valedictory Sermon; from Genesis 2.7. “And the Lord God formed man, of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” The house was so crowded that with great difficulty we obtained seats.— The Sermon was flashy declamation upon mind— He read that diamond of inspiration the 13th. Chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians—and closed by singing solo as a hymn, “When shall we all meet again.” While he spoke I thought his discourse admirable, and his tribute to the members of Congress deceased in the course of the Session drew tears from my eyes.— His eloquence is the bubbling foam of a shallow stream, rising in mist, and irradiated by the Sun beam with all the evanescent colours of the rainbow. As he descended from the pulpit, I shook his hand, and thanked him for all his labours and services as Chaplain, and particularly for the sermon of this day.— In the afternoon I attended at St. John’s church where Mr Hawley, who has returned from his excursion, read the Evening prayer for the 13th. Sunday after Trinity, and preached from Hosea 10.1. [“]Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself.” As I was returning home I was accosted by a stranger who entered into conversation with me, and said his name was Jason B. Wells, of the town of De Ruyter in the State of New-York; as we came up to my house, I invited him in, and he came in and sat in conversation with me about half an hour. My health is sinking under the combined pressure of summer heat, toil and anxiety— I have daily and nightly warning to be prepared for a sudden summons to meet my maker, and yet disregard them all. My hope is of Mercy. "

I gave a sitting of an hour to Mr Beard, who asked for one more, which I promised—It is a sad exhibition of caducity— Young Brent was there; and read to me a very flattering and ambitious character of me in an early number of the Democratic review. The house had been half an hour in Session when I reached the hall— Arnold was rowing against wind and tide to introduce a Resolution to take his retrenchment bill N. 548 out of Committee of the whole on the state of the Union this day or to-morrow—but the vote was 74 to 90 against suspending the rules.— But this day the surrender of the public lands to dilapidation and waste was consummated— Irretrievably gone— Cowen of Ohio first offered a Resolution to take Barnard’s Bill to supply a temporary defect or failure of the revenue out of Committee, this day at 12. O’Clock— Carried and then at Cowen’s motion also the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Joseph R. Ingersoll in the chair— The first step was to dispose of the patch bill, but Roosevelt, Fillmore, Holmes, Everett and Gordon, kept up a running fire of debate till noon, when the guillotine fell on Gordon’s eloquence— Barnard implored a few minutes to defend and explain his own bill, but was inexorably refused— Barnard offered a succession of amendments which were adopted without discussion—the question was taken upon substituting Charles J. Ingersoll’s bill and lost— The same fate befell W. Cost Johnson’s substitute, but M’Kennon’s substitute, the vetoed bill, with the land-distribution Section struck out and making tea and coffee duty-free, was carried after numerous proposals of amendments, all rejected. M’Kennon’s amendment was at last adopted by tellers 99 to 67— The new bill was reported to the house—the previous question called and carried— Rhett moved to lay the Bill on the table, but withdrew the motion— On the question of the engrossment of the bill the Speaker announced the yeas and nays 100 to 101 and the bill rejected— Thompson of Indiana moved a reconsideration, and the previous question— But it was discovered that in counting one affirmative vote had been omitted— The Speaker announced a tie 101 to 101. and gave his casting vote against the bill— But the motion to reconsider was carried 106 to 98— Then on the second question to engross the vote was 103 to 102. announced carried—long debate whether the Speaker could vote to make a tie—he did vote, but Landaff W. Andrews and Stanly who had withheld their votes, voted ay and the vote stood 105 to 102 and the deed was done. The long agony was over and the lands are lost forever— The title was changed and a motion made to style the bill an Act for revenue and the protection of manufactures, but lost— The Corporals’ guard divided equally upon the bill. Cushing, Irwin, and with extreme reluctance Proffit voting for, and Gilmer, Mallory and Wise against it— General, Mrs and Mary Jesup were here this Evening— Dr Thomas also here in medical attendance— "

Tuesday—  It was half past 9 when I reached the Capitol this morning— I met Mr Granger in the house, who told me that Mr Cushing one other member and himself had met in the chamber of the Committee of foreign Affairs and Mr Cushing not being ready with his report on the Mexican claims they had adjourned without waiting for a quorum, till Friday— In the house, Stanly proposed a joint resolution, instructing the Secretary of the Navy to continue experiments for testing Samuel Colt’s submarine battery— He has already made two of experiments, one of them yesterday, when he blew up a small old vessel, which has cost about 6000 dollars, and now, he wants authority to spend many thousand dollars more in experimenting to blow up Men of War, by submarine explosion. After some debate the Resolution was referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs— Mr Barnard struggled hard to get up a bill for remedial justice and after a failure of a quorum, a call of the house, a motion to lay the bill on the table, and the yeas and nays twice taken, he carried, 75 to 54 the resolution to take the bill out of Committee, one hour after it shall be the next time considered—but he omitted to name the day and could not prevail on the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the bill— The house finally went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union at the motion of Hopkins, and took up the general Post-Office Bill— This is a Bill of details of many Post officers, newly established and a small number discontinued— The bill was read through by sections, and many members were dissatisfied with the decisions of the Committee— More than all Arnold of Tennessee who complained bitterly of the discontinuance of a Post route in his District— The quorum failed three or four times— Arnold would not suffer any question to be taken without a Quorum—and time after time the chairman reported the fact to the house; a call of the house was moved and carried pursued till 8 or ten members beyond a quorum answered—then the call was superseded—the Chairman of the Committee of the whole took the chair, and in five minutes time, another question arose upon which no quorum voted, and the same scene was enacted over again— This trifling was carried on, till four O’Clock when the Committee rose and reported the bill to the house, and soon after the house adjourned— I went into the Senate chamber and spoke to Mr Bates, and Mr Archer in behalf of William Willis for a small increase of his pension and they both promised their aid to carry his bill through the Senate as Mr Summers chiefly worried it through the house— I spoke also to Mr Benjamin about papers required by his nephew Pearce at Albany.

I called this morning at the Department of State and delivered to him a Letter from Dr. Flügel the Consul of the United States at Leipsic— I congratulated him on the successful issue of his negotiation with Lord Ashburton, and he said he was glad to have got it off, of his shoulders. I spoke to him of the Resolution of the house calling for copies of Lewis Cass’s protest against the ratification by France of the quintuple Treaty of the Treaty itself and of all the correspondence relating to it— The President had declined communicating those papers then; alledging that no official copy of the quintuple Treaty had been received, and that the other papers requested could not consistently with the public interest be communicated then but he hoped they might be, soon— This message had been referred by the house to the Committee of foreign affairs, which with my consent had acquiesced in the postponement of the communication of the papers. That on my mentioning the subject again a few days since in Committee, Mr Cushing had enquired if I should be willing to see the Secretary of State on the subject, to which I had readily agreed— He said there might be inconvenience in the publication before the treaty shall come back from England, ratified— And then the whole correspondence would be published— And in the meantime if I desired it they should be communicated to me in confidence.— He said they had a copy of the quintuple Treaty though not communicated to them officially— He spoke with great severity of the conduct both of Cass and of Stevenson upon this subject, and said they thought to make great political headway upon a popular gale— I went next to the Treasury Department and spoke to Mr M’Clintock Young, the Chief Clerk— The Secretary, Walter Forward being yet absent at the Bedford Springs.— I asked for the papers of Mr Miller, the candidate, for an appointment as Lieutenant of a Revenue cutter— He has been teazing me to death about them these eighteen months— He said he would have the paper hunted up if they were there— He said he would also make returns as soon as possible to the call relating to the proceeds of the sales of the public lands— At the house Gwin was packing to get up the bill for the relief of General Jackson— Barnard urged to take up the remedial justice Bill, and Botts moved a suspension of the rules, for a loan bill with a distribution section—lost 61 to 62— Cave Johnson moved a call for annual returns of naval expenditures— Cushing moved to be excused from voting because he said the house had no right by resolution to call for permanent returns— The resolution was adopted.

Cushing and Proffit yesterday opposed Cave Johnson’s call for annual returns of naval expenditures, on the ground that the house had no power by resolution to make any permanent call— I remarked that the Officers of the guard would soon leave the house no power at all; and read the Resolution of the house of 30. December 1791. upon which for the space of fifty years, the annual returns of receipts and expenditures have been made and published— W. Cost Johnson presented a memorial from Maryland for his projected issue of 200,000,000 of dollars of 4 percent stocks, to be distributed among the States and to be redeemed by the proceeds of the sales of the public lands— Botts offered a joint-resolution to adjourn next Monday. Proffit objected— Botts moved and carried a suspension of the rules 117 to 49. Habersham moved to lay the Resolution on the table— No. 68 to 101.— Resolution carried 96 to 71. Landaff W. Andrews, moved a reconsideration to lose it, and it was lost. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, John Pope in the Chair, the Bill to regulate the pay of pursers and warrant Officers in the Navy was driven through, reported to the house and passed: against numerous attempts to reduce the Salaries. It gives salaries to the pursers, and takes away their emoluments. Colts submarine battery was laid on the table, but Cowen moved a reconsideration.— The house at 4. adjourned for want of a quorum— The floods of rain last night were unexampled. The bridge over the Tiber in Pennsylvania avenue was overflown, and partly carried away— The avenue there was one sheet of water much damage done. I gave this morning the last sitting to Mr Beard for my portrait, and he finished it— A living ruin— He has also painted my cousin judge William Cranch, within one year of my own age— At the house Fillmore adverted to the shortness of time left before the close of the Session, and the necessity of selecting from 63 bills from the Senate on the Clerks table, those which can be acted on during the remaining time— He afterwards moved to take up the reconsideration of the vote to lay the fortification bill on the table— It was taken up and carried; and the bill was passed—91 to 79— The appropriation for experiments upon Colts submarine battery was carried after reconsideration— The Post-Office bill was next passed— Atherton moved a Treasury Note bill, while the question is before the Committee of Ways and Means of which he is a member— Suspension of the rules refused 76 to 78. Gentry from the Committee of public Lands presented a land distribution bill— Its reception contested, but carried— I offered a Resolution to stop the pay of voluntary absentee members of the house— Captious objections— Extended by amendment to the Senate— Carried 134 to 18— Then the bill for the re-organization of the Navy Department and a speech from Wise— After the adjournment—I went into the Senate chamber and find them killing my resolution by a tie— Mrs Thornton, Mrs. and Mary Talbot here.

The fate of my Resolution offered yesterday, to stop hereafter the pay of absentee members of the House of Representatives would furnish matter for four pages of this diary—but it must pass— I called at the National Intelligencer Office with a special request to Mr Gales that the proceedings of both houses upon the resolution might be correctly reported— The report in the Intelligencer of this morning of the proceedings in the house is grossly incorrect, and there is no report at-all of the proceedings in the Senate— This morning Mr G. L. Thompson called on me to mention that he had made a discovery of a fund of upwards of a million of dollars in the Navy Department consisting of unclaimed Seamen’s wages, which might be applied to any other useful purpose— This morning at the meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs were present Adams, Cushing, Everett, Granger, Caruthers, Shepperd, White absent, Meriwether gone home, and Stuart, sick— Mr Cushing produced his report on the Mexican claims— After some discussion it was agreed that some amendments should be made to the report and Cushing was authorised to make it, if approved by Mr Everett and myself.— Adjourned to meet again next Tuesday if Congress should still be then in Session— In the house the approaching close of the Session was manifested, by the transaction of much helter skelter business— Gwin of Mississippi continued to teaze the house with the most perverse perseverance to pass the bill to give a gratuity of about 4000 dollars under colour of refunding to General Jackson a fine levied upon him by Judge Hall at New-Orleans, in 1815— This is a crumb of political swindling got up by Davezac a profligate French Creole of New-Orleans, now commorant in the City of New-York, and disgracing it as one of its representatives in the State Legislature— Gwin has been harassing the house day after day to get up this bill reported by three out of nine members of the judiciary committee with a characteristic five points report by Charles J. Ingersoll— Gwin failed to get up the bill this day but it will be carried in the next Congress, if not in the next Session.— Two notable bills were driven through the house this day. One to repeal the proviso to the 6th. Section of the Act of 4. Septr. 1841. suspending the distribution of the proceeds of the Land-sales, among the States— The bill finally passed by yeas and nays 104 to 86.— The bill for remedial justice was also crowded by a rallying of the whigs, first through the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Joseph R. Ingersoll in the Chair, and finally through the house by yeas and nays 92 to 84— The bill for the relief of William Willis passed the Senate— Old Mr Gilpin aged 78 came down 20 miles on horseback this hottest day of the Summer to see and talk, and dine with me— Noah Fletcher came to claim my aid to save him from dismission as a Clerk— And Boyd Reilly for an Invention.

Saturday—  The Calms and breathless summer heats of the Nights continue with unrelenting perseverance— I scarcely slept an hour of the last Night— This was again a day of all work in the house of Representatives. First a bill to compound with the sureties of Samuel Swartwout late collector at New-York and a defaulter for 6 or 1200000 dollars— After a sharp struggle of sundry New-York members to carry it through was laid on the table. Mr Fillmore then proposed to take up successively the Senate bills at the third reading—then those in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and lastly, those in Committee of the whole. The bills not objected to were, passed in numbers, one after the other, but many were objected to and arrested— Linn was chairman of both Committees of the whole— Turney objected to the bill for the settlement of the balance due on the Massachusetts claim— I pleaded hard with Turney to withdraw his objection, but he was inflexible— Mark A Cooper, attempted to get up the bill for the relief of Coll. Watson of Georgia, (for slaves sold to him for a song, by General Jesup’s orders, which he says he paid for, but never had the negroes, nor his money returned to him[)]— I objected to it again— On one taking of the yeas and nays there were 156 votes—there had been yesterday one of 190. but almost all the business done in Committees of this day there were not more than half a quorum of members present— When the bill in Committee of the whole were gone through a motion was made to rise and report the bills. Arnold rose and objected that there was no quorum present, Linn said he must report the bills— Arnold appealed from the decision, Linn refused to entertain the appeal, left the Chair and reported— Arnold objected to the reception of the report and stated the facts The Speaker said he could know nothing of what had passed in Committee but from the report of the Chairman, and he proceeded to put the question on the first of the bills— I called somewhat indignantly for a division; expressing strongly my regret that the chairman and the Speaker had both dealt so roughly with Arnold. The vote on the division was 40 to 15—only 55 members voting.— There was a call of the house and a quorum formed— Adjourned before 5 at my motion— The Senate passed the Tariff bill with amendments 24 to 23.— Mr Bradford came this Evening, and beat me at Chess We had visits also from Mr Benjamin Rush, and Mr Bozman Kerr. At Mr Rodney’s request I wrote 6 lines in his mother’s prayer book. "

                "text": "28. V:30. Sunday.  There was no preaching this day at the Capitol, wherefore I attended the morning service of public worship at the second presbyterian church— The same person preached whom I had heard last Sunday afternoon, the Pastor, the Revd. Rufus W. Clark being absent on a tour for his health— This Gentleman’s text this day was from John 6.44. [“]No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him”; he omitted the remainder of the verse—“and I will raise him up, at the last day.” This is an awfully mysterious chapter— In which Jesus revealed himself to his disciples in assertions of unlimited power; in language professedly spiritual, but so unusually figurative, and so obscurely foreshadowed, that many of the disciples of Jesus, departed from him offended at the immensurate members which he put forth—telling them that they must eat his flesh, and drink his blood— Of all this our preacher took no sort of notice; but in commenting upon the necessity of God’s drawing men to Christ, he fell into a fervid exhortation to his hearers to suffer themselves to be drawn without delay—and then by way of ascending climax he said God the father says—delay not— Our Lord Jesus Christ says—delay not— The holy Spirit says delay not— Hell says delay not— The devil says delay not— Come oh come to Christ! Was it possible to refrain from laughter. After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Welbur read the Evening prayers for the 14th Sunday after Trinity, and preached from Matthew 17.1 After these things Jesus “And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart 2. and was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the Sun, and his raiment was white as the light. 3. And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias, talking with him 4. Then answered Peter, and said unto him Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias 5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and, behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.” This is the scene of the Transfiguration, a subject too weighty for an afternoon Sermon— After the service, I called at Mr T. B. Johnson’s, but he had rode out, and had taken the key of the outside door with him— I afterwards called at Mrs Madison’s. Found Mrs Crittenden, Mary Cutts and Mr Henry van Rensselaer there— Mrs John Graham, and Miss Virginia Tayloe successively came in, paid short visits and retired— I did the same. The heat continues insupportable. "

The closing days of a Session of Congress are always days of extreme confusion— This is one of them, but we have only two more of them in prospect at present— The House had sent to the Senate a joint Resolution for adjournment on this day— The Senate took it up this morning, and passed it, changing the day to Wednesday next 2. O’Clock PM. and the house concurred with this Amendment— A motion was made by Mr Gamble of Georgia to reconsider this vote, but no vote was taken upon it— In the house, Mr Botts moved a Resolution to give an additional gratuity of 250 dollars to the Revd. Septimus Tustin, Chaplain to the Senate for his services during this interminable Session— Objection was made— Botts moved to suspend the rules, but could not carry it— It was observed that the motion did not include a similar gratuity to Mr Maffitt the Chaplain of the house— The tariff bill came back from the Senate with numerous amendments, adopted after an obstinately contested debate last Saturday evening 24 to 23.— The progress of the Tariff controversy exhibits a signal exemplification of what I have long and often remarked as a law of political gravitation as uniform in its operation as that other gravitation which governs the system of the Universe— It is that of all great systems of policy maintained by antagonist parties and subject to deliberative decision the opposite practical measures are modified into mutual approximation, till they come to a balance turned by a single vote. So has it pre-eminently been, in this revenue bill— In the house of Representatives it was twice pronounced rejected and finally carried by a majority of two votes in 208— In the Senate it has been finally carried by a majority of one vote—when it came back, before the question of concurring with the Senate’s amendments was taken Clifford moved to lay the bill on the table— But so little disposed to this was the same house, where a majority of 2 had been so recently extorted by a convulsion that upon the motion now to lay the bill and amendments on the table, the yeas and nays were but 65 to 120.— The amendments of the Senate were all adopted in a lump, without a division of the house, and a reconsideration moved by M’Kennon to be rejected was rejected in the same manner— A great mass of other business was transacted in Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union Joseph R. Ingersoll in the Chair, among which was a Treasury Note Bill for 6. Millions, and a concurrence in the amendment of the Senate to the Resolution of adjournment, fixing it for next Wednesday at 2. P.M— Mr Barnard spent part of the Evening with us. "

The only members present were Adams, Caruthers, Granger, White— Absent Cushing, Everett, Meriwether, Shepperd, Stuart— Adjourned without day— In the house, Calhoun moved a long resolution about the manufacture of firearms in private establishments and at the public armouries; but it was not adopted— Joseph R. Ingersoll offered a Resolution, for granting from the contingent fund of the house a gratuity to the Officers, Clerks, Messengers, Pages, labourers, watch, gate-keeper, lamplighter and other of the house, equal to that which was given at the close of the long session of the last Congress.— The Senate had so done for their Officers— Cave Johnson objected— Ingersoll moved a suspension of the rules, and lost it 61 to 64— The Bill for reorganizing the Navy Department was at last carried through after undergoing a total metamorphosis— It abolishes the board of Navy commissioners; and substitutes 5 bureaus, 3 of them with Captains in the Navy at their head— T. B. King made an hour speech in support of the Bill.— Wise moved a budget of amendments some of which passed without opposition, and others were rejected— I moved an additional section, repealing the laws and parts of Laws, which authorize the President or head of Department to transfer appropriations from one branch of expenditure to another so far as relates to the Navy Department— My amendment was adopted, and then out of regard for King I suffered the bill to pass.— While King was speaking there came in a message containing a bundle of protests by the President against the act of the house, adopting my report of the select Committee of 13 on his last veto message— When it was read I said a few words declining from motives of personal delicacy to propose any measures to the house. Botts moved four Resolutions three of which in the same words with those adopted by the Senate in April 1834 on receiving a similar protest from President Jackson, for which Resolutions John Tyler and Daniel Webster both voted. Botts read large extracts from an eloquent Speech of Webster on that occasion moved a fourth resolution, that the Clerk of the house be directed to return Tyler’s protest to its author.— The first three Resolutions were adopted 87 to 46. 86 to 48 and 86 to 53. I declined voting upon the 4th. which was lost 62 to 69. Other business occupied the house till half past 6 when the adjourned for lack of a Quorum. "

My brother Charles’s daughter Mrs Susan Boylston Treadway, and her daughter Mrs Susan Maria Clark Crane, with her infant son Charles and a black Nurse named Julia, left us, and embarked at 6 this morning in the Steamer for Richmond, Virginia where Mr Crane resides.— I went down with my Grand daughter Mary-Louisa, to the boat with them, and introduced to them Mr Botts who had promised me to pay all suitable attention to them— Mr Arrington and Mr M’Kay, members of the house from North-Carolina, were also in the Boat. The closing day of a Session of Congress is always a day of reckless confusion, and to me of distress and mortification. It was pre-eminently so this day.— Mr Tustin made an appropriate parting prayer. As soon as the journal was read, Wise moved to amend it by inserting the President’s Message of Protest in extenso— Wise thought to get it on to the Journal by this trick, but the house having declared yesterday by Resolution that it should not be entered on the Journal, were not thus to be baffled of their purpose— There was a precedent precisely in point in the New-Jersey election case at the first Session of the 26th. Congress; upon the notification of which by the Speaker to Mr Wise he asked and obtained leave to withdraw his motion.— From that time till half past two O’Clock the time was spent in calls of the house to obtain a Quorum—in passing rejecting or laying on the table bills and resolutions, with or without a quorum, in taking yeas and nays, counting by tellers, and driving through or defeating as the humour happened to work— An appropriation of 6000 dollars by joint resolution was forced through by the Speaker against my earnest and repeated remonstrances— Cushing, William Cost Johnson, Arnold and Pope each gave notice that he should start his favourite hobby at an early day of the next Session; and T. F. Marshall gave notice that he should oppose Cushing’s exchequer, and M’Kennon gave notice that he should oppose Arnold’s bill N. 548. The usual messages at the close of the Session were interchanged, and at half past 2 pm the Speaker adjourned the house to the first Monday in December next— Mrs Smith returned this morning from Mr Frye’s. I called at Major Nourse’s Office this morning—and he called this afternoon on me. I had an evening visit also from my next door neighbour Mr Parris, and from Mr J. F. Lamb. "

Jesse Leach, comes from Rockville— Was a Sadler by trade, and from religious impulses involved himself in debt to the amount of several thousand dollars, from which he has been for several years unable to extricate himself.

I said I knew not whether the President had signed the resolution or not, but I objected to the drawing of any money from the Treasury under its authority— I requested Mr M’Clintock Young the Chief Clerk to inform the President of my objection; and to say that I wished to give no unnecessary trouble to the Department, or notoriety to the transaction, and would be satisfied with an assurance that no money should be drawn from the Treasury upon this resolution before the next Session—but I should otherwise address and publish a Letter to the Secretary of the Treasury on the subject— I went to the General Post-Office with a Letter from Jesse Murdock about the Post-Office at Carver— The Postmaster General was so much engaged that I could not see him, but I read and gave the Letter to Mr Philo C.

Pearce of Newport, Rhode-Island indicted for Treason against the State soliciting my aid in his defence— I could not hesitate an instant to undertake it, though it comes upon me like a thunder-clap— No one can imagine what I suffered, when I engaged to defend before the Supreme Court of the United States the lives and liberty of 36 Africans of the Amistad, nor with what gratitude to heaven, I heard the decision of the Court pronouncing them free— And with what delight I dwelt upon the confident hope that it was the last occasion upon which I should ever be called to stake my personal, moral, intellectual and political character upon issues involving the lives, fortunes, and characters of others as well as my own— I have now on hand a controversial warfare with John Tyler President of the United States; bitter personal hatred of five of the most depraved, most talented, and most influential men of this Country, four of them open and undisguised—C. J. Ingersoll, Wise, T. F. Marshall, and W. Cost Johnson; the fifth under a mask—nameless— And now, this trial for Treason—which will be at least as much a trial of me as of Pearce himself— The Mercy of God is the only anchor of my Soul for deliverance from this ordeal.

He said there was; sent a clerk for it, and put it into my hands— It was signed—Approved—John Tyler— I desired Mr Webster, to say to the President that I protested against the drawing of any money from the Treasury under authority of that Resolution, which I considered unconstitutional null and void— I had remonstrated against it in vain at every stage of its passage through the house— Introduced from the Senate, within the last half hour of the Session; without a word of reason or of explanation—driven through by repeated previous questions, and for an expenditure itself very exceptionable, I had notified Mr Young Chief Clerk of the Treasury, that I proposed to move at the next Session of Congress to rescind that Resolution— That if I could be assured no money would be drawn from the Treasury under its authority, I would take no further notice of it, but I would otherwise address to the Secretary of the Treasury and publish a Letter stating my objections against it— I read to Mr Fletcher Webster the paragraphs of the Constitution which I understand to interdict the appropriation of money by Resolution, and requested him to state them to the President and to communicate to me his decision upon the subject before next Tuesday, when I expected to leave the City. He said he would— This profligate and outrageous violation of the Constitution imposes upon me duties of bitter anguish and hopeless prospect. I called twice, at Major Nourse’s Office, and was compelled to give up my intention to reinvest 1200 dollars of Treasury Notes of which I received payment; in April and June last— At the Clerk’s Office of the House of Representatives I received the minute of Petitions presented by me during the recent Session and of the Committees to which they were referred. I bespoke the printed sheets of the remnant of the Journals of both houses, as they will be published, and in the Library of Congress gave a cursory perusal to Swift’s Contests and Dissensions in Athens and Rome; but found not there what I had expected— At the Office of the National Intelligencer Mr Seaton spoke to me of the Smithsonian bequest Bill, with which nothing can be done till the next Session— Evening walk to the President’s grounds— Music. Evening visitors—Mrs Elliot, Mr Thomas—Walter Hellen—Mary Cutts. "

Morning worship at the Presbyterian Church, where Mr M’Lane preached—the same who ministered in the same pulpit last Sunday— His text this morning was from Hebrews 11.6. [“]But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him—” A Sermon upon Faith— my thunder— How few educated Christians are there but believe that God is— Alas! how much fewer who square their lives by that belief— I believe that God is—but I live as if he was not— Conduct is the result of impulse, far more than of belief— All religious profession passes with the world for hypocrisy or imbecility, or both— The Apostle says that he who cometh to God must believe that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him— A rewarder? must we then like Falstaff follow for the reward? Is there—can there be any merit in seeking diligently, or in following for the reward— The disinterested love of God is a doctrine of the Hopkinsian creed; but I believe there is no such thing in human nature— I reverence God as my Creator—As creator of the world. I reverence him with holy fear— I venerate Jesus Christ as my redeemer; and as far as I can understand, the redeemer of the world— But this belief is dark and dubious— The worship of God is a tribute of the heart—but worship can do no good to him— Worship for reward is the virtue of a sycophant disinterested worship is inanity— The Indian Savage deprecates the malevolence of his deity— So does the Christian trembler, when he says it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God— After dinner at St. John’s church, Mr Hawley read prayers for the 15th Sunday after Trinity and preached from Philippians 3.17. [“]Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so, as ye have me for an ensample (omit the verses in brackets 18 and 19) For our conversation is in Heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.”— I called after church at Mr T. B. Johnson’s house, but he was not at home— I am obliged to hasten my preparations for departure, and to occupy much of the Sunday with the business of the week— Evening visitors to take leave, Mr King the painter, Mary Talbot, Mr Miller, Mr Cutts and his daughter Mary— In rummaging over my files of papers, I found among them those of Samuel N. Miller which have been so long missing, and the petition of George Newcomb and others to the Secretary of the Treasury— "

Mr William Darby the Geographer and Astronomer was here twice, morning and evening—He proposes to take upon a lease for ten years the dwelling house next door to Captain Carbery’s, which has been several years untenanted or worse than empty— It is in a very dilapidated condition, and as property worse than nothing— I called at the paymaster General’s Office and upon consultation with Mr Frye concluded to close with Mr Darby’s proposals— I visited the Treasury Department, where I found the Secretary Walter Forward, returned last evening from his excursion to the Bedford Springs , to recover from a bilious fever— I took to him the papers of Samuel N. Miller, which I had found yesterday among my files; and also the Petition from George Newcomb and others for the bounty upon their fishing Schooner which was lost, and the recommendatory letter with it— Mr Forward said he would give to both cases deliberate consideration, I spoke to him of the joint resolution appropriation—told him the manner in which it had been swindled through both Houses of Congress; and my objections against it, as unconstitutional, null and void— He promised to look into it very seriously; but the deed is done— I received this day an impertinent Letter from Fletcher Webster, bloated with self, sufficiency as an Executive Officer, maintaining that an appropriation by Resolution is quite as proper and valid as if made by Law, and that he has already made the requisition at the Department of the Treasury for the 6000 dollars appropriated by the Resolution— Fletcher Webster, the first exploit of whose manhood was to debauch and get with child his own cousin under the desecrated protection of his father’s roof is by that same father’s appointment chief clerk, and now acting Secretary of the Department of State, strutting about with all the insolence of Office, and blundering on with all the ignorance of an unschooled boy— He says in his Letter that there are numerous precedents of this course— I answered him this Evening, and called for a specification of his numerous precedents— I went also to the Capitol, and examined the journal of the Senate; and traced up the fraud to the South-Carolina Senator, W. C. Preston, connived at by George Evans. Chairman of their Committee of finance—as arrant a piece of sheer knavery, as ever was perpetrated at East-cheap or found its reward at Tyburn— And Preston and Evans are two of the ablest men, and most efficient whigs in Congress. My day was absorbed in making preparations for our departure which is postponed till Wednesday morning— Walter Hellen is going with us and Mary Cutts as far as New-York— Mr Darby and Mr Frye were here this Evening. Darby agrees to take the house on a lease for ten years at a rent of 150 dollars a year— The first years rent to be expended in repairs— Mr Frye will draw the lease— The Revd. Mr Armstrong a Scotch Episcopalian Minister, at Wheeling and Eliza Johnson once, daughter of Roger Johnson now Mrs Armstrong, and J. Bozman Kerr were here— Also Walter Hellen. "

Mr William Darby came this morning and informed me that he had concluded to take the house, next door to Captain Carbery’s, on a lease for ten years at 150 dollars a year rent—the first years rent to be expended by him in repairs on the place— The poor man’s chance for ten years of life, appears to be not much better that my own; but he is ten years younger, and says he has enjoyed good health all his life. I was engaged the whole of this day in procuring money for our journey home; the bank Bills of Virginia and Maryland having no currency in the Northern States— Mr Frye gave me last Evening a check on James Adams, Cashier of the Bank of Washington for 400 dollars, which was almost entirely absorbed by wages due to persons of my house hold— Thomas Dumphy’s wages had run up for more than 18 months, nearly all the time at 18 dollars a month— My household expenses at this place from the 15th. of last November when my wife arrived here to this day amount as daily entered in my book to 2963—66. in which are included no house rent—no taxes; besides many articles purchased by Mr Frye, and by my Son, for our household use, and charged in their accounts— I believe I have been able by extreme parsimony, unremitting and most anxious vigilance, and by keeping a written account of every cent of expenditure to keep my expenses always within my income since I was cast back from the President’s Office upon my own resources, but of all the trials incidental to the retirement of a man from a scale of household expenses suitable to an income of 25000 dollars a year to one of very small means and very great incitements to spend, is the most excruciating. economy is a relative virtue, and that which to a poor man is indispensable frugality to a rich one is insufferable meanness.— I received this day from Fletcher Webster a reply to my answer as impertinent, as ignorant and as insolent as the former:— Into what hands have the Presidency, the Departments of State and of the Treasury fallen! Daniel Webster his father, Secretary of State has gone to Marshfield to shoot snipes and fish for trout, and to patch up some shameful rents in his private finances— Except calling at the Bank of Washington and at Charles J. Nourse’s Office for changeable change, I was all this day drudging to assort papers and packing up for departure— Many of our neighbours called upon us to take leave of us— I have not found time to assort endorse and file the multitudes of Letters that I have received within the last six months, and I go oppressed with invitations from D. J. Pearce and my Constituents which lie heavy at my heart— "

I was very unwell all day yesterday, with a dull headache and a dejected spirit, under the rank and I fear irrecoverable degeneracy of the present age— Irretrievable because it has infected the whole body of the people— I had towards evening some feverish symptoms but I had a good night’s rest, awoke a quarter before a church bell clock rang four, and having no conveniences for writing, lay till five when after a suitable time I roused my family; and taking a hack for my family walked down the Street to the Steamer for Bordentown— I met in the passage way between the barroom and the outer street door, Mr Henshaw of Boston, who told me that he left Boston—had seen my Son, the day before, and he was well—but that Harriet Welsh was at the point of death with the Dysentery— We started in the steamer at precisely at 7. with about 500 fellow passengers, some 300 of whom were bound upon an excursion of pleasure to New-York and thence out in a Steamer, round the harbour and bay and islands— They had a band of music, consisting of seven brothers and two or three besides, who entertained us with frequent symphonies, and for the first time in my life a Serenade of music annoyed me— They say they have these excursion parties once a week through the Summer Season from Philadelphia—and they proceed, swelling in numbers as they go on— Men, matrons and maidens, joining the party at Burlington, Bristol and Bordentown, whence they started in a train of thirty or forty Cars, which were in attendance to receive them, for Amboy and we saw no more of them— From Bordentown we proceeded through Trenton, Princeton, New-Brunswick, Elizabeth-town, Newark, over the Hackinsack and Passaic rivers to the ferry in Jersey city formerly Paulus Hoek— I took a hack to carry us from the landing of New-York, about a quarter of a mile, for which the driver made me pay him two dollars— His name was Develin, and I told him I should remember it— We stop’d at the City Hall and dined there, but the house has sadly fallen off— The dinner was very indifferent— I took passage in the Steamer Massachusetts, Captain Comstock, which I expected would from Stonington proceed round by Newport to Providence, and I intended to land at Newport— But of all the days of the week it happens that the trip of this day is the only one when she does not go round— We left Miss Cutts at the City Hotel, to go up this Evening by the Steamer to Albany and Troy, to visit Mrs Dickinson, mother of Mrs Benjamin O. Tayloe, who is with her. We embarked in the Massachusetts, and cast off from battery pier N. 1. precisely at 5. P.M. The weather, had been again all day warm fair but gathering clouds from the morning, and by the time we had worked round Sands’s point the premonitors of a North easter were discernible. "

V: Saturday  My Son goes every morning to Boston to attend the Session of the Legislature, specially convened to arrange the ten Congressional Districts into which Congress by the apportionment act of the recent session have directed that the State shall be divided— He usually returns late in the Evening, but this day came out by four in the afternoon— On our arrival yesterday in the very fury of the rain-storm we made a repast combining breakfast and dinner— I then had a fire made in my library, and sat me down to write. My diary was in arrear, commencing with the day before we left Washington— I brought up that day, and wrote to Dutee J. Pearce as I had promised— Walter Hellen copied my Letter, and I gave it to my son this morning to put into the Post-Office at Boston— I gave him also Mr Thomas B. Johnson’s order upon him in my favour for 530 dollars, dated last April, since which I have not had time to forward it to him— This morning George Newcome came to enquire about his joint memorial with others to obtain the bounty, upon a fishing Schooner which was lost— I told him that I had myself delivered it to the Secretary of the Treasury, together with the recommendatory Letter, which had accompanied it. He had promised to examine the case and inform me of his decision upon it. I had myself doubts of the power of the Secretary to allow the bounty on such a case, and apprehended he would refer the Petitioners to Congress. Newcomb said he had been told at the Boston Custom-house, that the bounty had been allowed in similar cases— Mr Allen a lawyer living in the State of Maine came to repeat enquiries which he had before addressed to me by Letter, concerning the marriage of the late Ward Nicholas Boylston with his first wife. He had seen my answer to the enquiries addressed to me by Mr Charles Davies of Portland—and I could give him little further information. He entertained an idea that the marriage had been a forced one, and that the parties had never lived together. At dusk of Evening Charles A. Cummings, Justin Spear, and the Revd John Gregory came as a Committee from the Norfolk County Temperance Society with a Letter from Mr Joseph Harrington its President, proposing Wednesday the 28th. instt. for the annual meeting of the Society, at which I am to make them an address. I agreed to meet them at 3 O’Clock p.m of that day—and this too is to be a mock pageant— I took tea and spent the Evening at my Son’s house where Miss Mary Bigelow, daughter of Doctor Bigelow of Boston entertained me with delightful music on the Piano.

                "text": "11. V. Sunday.  Louisa C. Smith, my cousin came out from Boston last Evening to stay with us, till we return to Washington next November— At the stone Temple the Revd. Mr Brazer, of Salem preached this morning from Psalm 19.12. “Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.” an excellent moral discourse. There is no deeper or more difficult study than that of our own secret faults. Secret even to ourselves, for there is no hypocrisy so base as that with which we deceive ourselves, and no weakness more deplorable than that with which we appease our consciences by indulging the faults which we cannot disguise from ourselves— It is perhaps not possible to trace in the Psalms of David the train of thought that constitutes the unity of each Psalm— This one begins by announcing that the Sun and Moon are the irrefragable evidence of the glory of God.— This is Persian Theology and must be natural religion. Then there is a poetical description of the Sun riding daily round the globe with the exultation of a Bridegroom— Then there is an instantaneous transition from the physical to the moral world and a magnificent tribute to the Law of God— All moral virtue is then ascribed to the fear of God—but the question occurs who can understand his errors? and immediately an appeal is taken to the Mercy of God, to cleanse the psalmist from secret faults—to which he adds a suplication for delivery from presumptuous sins and closes with a general petition that the words of his mouth and the meditation of his heart may be acceptable in the sight of the Lord, his strength and his redeemer— Is this not the very consummation of the spirit of prayer? Would not the perfection of human virtue consist in making the whole idea of this Psalm an exemplification of a man’s whole life? Mr Brazer’s afternoon sermon was from Matthew 19.29. [“]And every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren, or sisters or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my names sake shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life.” Mr Brazier guarded against the misapprehension of a construction which would actually require the abandonment of all those objects— on returning home from church this afternoon I found here Mr P. P. F. Degrand and Mr E. H. Derby, who took teas and spent the Evening here. Mr Beale paid us an evening visit— My wife who was confined all day yesterday to her bed, was up and about again this day; but quite unwell, and with feverish symptoms yet upon her. Degrand as usual brought out a budget of Newspapers. "

Walter Hellen went into Boston with my Son this morning, and returned with him this Evening— I sent by my Son, an answer to the Letter of Mr Thomas Kinnicutt Speaker of the House, inviting me to attend the whig convention on Wednesday.— Mr Benjamin V. French of Braintree came with Mr Hartwell of Andover, who has in contemplation to open an agricultural school there. Mr French also brought a card of invitation to my wife and myself and a Letter from Marshall P. Wilder Chairman of the Committee of Invitations, to the Agricultural festival of the 14th. anniversary of the Massachusetts horticultural Society next Friday at 5. p.m.— Mr French spoke to me of the manuscript volume copy of the first volume of the Braintree town Records, which he and others of Braintree borrowed of me last year and promised to return very soon.— He said it was now in the hands of Mr Hayden, who was making rather too leisurely a copy from it—but the work was now nearly completed; and my book would soon by returned.— whereupon I record a Nota Bene. Mr French mentioned also the application to me in behalf of the three towns of Braintree, Quincy and Randolph, to write the history of the town of Braintree—and upon this I told him that I postponed answering the Letter, because it was impossible for me to answer it affirmatively while I retain a seat in Congress. Mr Minott Thayer was here this afternoon, with a nephew of his a youth of about 14 named Brown— I agreed to come to his house next Saturday at 12. O’Clock Noon, there to meet the procession with which I am to go to Mr Perkins’s church, for the reception— He says Mr Nathaniel Morton Davis will address me—and offer a series of Resolutions— I have no time for preparation of an Address as I had intended, and actually commenced, and must rely almost entirely on extemporaneous inspiration— Mr Thayer expressed great alarm that the whigs will lose the re-election of John Davis as Governor of the State for the next year, and seemed inclined to urge me to serve if nominated and said if I would I should receive two thirds of the votes throughout the Commonwealth. I know better; but I shall not make the trial— Mr Lunt also paid me an afternoon visit. Half an hour before Sunset, I took Kirk with me, walked down to Mr Daniel Greenleaf’s wharf and took a cold Sea bath— Charles, his wife and daughter, and Miss Bigelow, spent the Evening with us. "

Last Evening swarmed with musquitoes and there was a light thunder shower— The night continued warm, I cased myself again in summer cloathing; but was scarcely dressed before the Eastern wind breezed up again— A cloudy sky. rain and a gloomy day followed— I looked into my seminary enclosures where my seedling fruit trees have almost all perished— Deacon Spear and Mr George W. Beale came separately and talked with me about the weather and the crops, and fruit, and the bees that sting the peaches to death, and the six cows and a horse of Mr Daniel Greenleaf’s, poisoned last week no one knows how—and so infectious that it poisoned every man that touched them—one of whom Pickering was swolen to a sight, and in a frenzy, taking three men to keep him down in his bed. This morning Charles’s wife went to Boston with him, and Miss Mary Bigelow returned home— I strive to write but my physical strength deserts me, and the pen drowses out of my hand. At 3 this afternoon I walked to the orthodox Church, and heard the Revd. John Pierpont, deliver an address of an hour and a half upon Temperance. His Style was colloquial—familiar, lowly, but not vulgar—occasionally ludicrous— His argument was that the trade in the spirituous liquors, or wine was criminal— That water was created by God, for animals, and among them Man, to drink— That God created nothing else to be drank, and that to drink any thing else is to violate the Law of Nature— I envied Mr Pierpont his Talents— He drew a comparison between the three necessities of Nature, to sustain alike vegetable and animal life—Light air and water; and he argued that as they were all indispensably necessary to animal and vegetable life, there were furnished in quantities inexhaustable for the use of all; and that nothing else can supply their places— There was notice given of a Ladies Fair at Weymouth landing next Tuesday to aid the cause of Temperance and there was another meeting of this same Society this evening, at which Mr Pierpont announced that he should speak again—but more briefly— Charles spent the Evening here— He was a member of the Committee which sat before the special meeting of the Legislature to prepare a bill for districting the Commonwealth, conformably to the apportionment act of Congress. They reported a bill accordingly, and after a week’s debate, it passed they house this day, nearly as reported by the Committee— It has yet to pass through the ordeal of the Senate. "

Never was my mind in a state of deeper agitation than at this time— I awoke this morning some time before two O’Clock— Sat down in my chamber and wrote till five O’Clock— Then returned to bed and lay sleepless till 6. when I rose for the day— I employ what leisure I have in laying out a take leave speech for next Saturday. But the variety of topics upon which I must touch is so great, and every one of them must be so largely treated, that as I think and breathe upon them, they swell like soap bubbles, blown by boys through pipe-stems, till they burst, and resolve themselves into a mist. Mrs T— B. Adams, her daughter Elizabeth and her son John Quincy were here this morning, and I met them again afterwards at Charles’s house— A heavy gloom hung over my Spirits, and a numbness of feeling which I know not how to describe or to name— Immediately after dinner, I lay down on my bed and slept three hours, after which I was fresh and cheerful for the Evening— MrSmith andField called just at Sunset to invite me to deliver a Lecture before the Boston Lyceum on the evening of the 6th. of October.— I have been for the last five or six years, been absolutely teazed to deliver Lectures before this institution and have made them several times conditional engagements to comply with their requests but have been always disappointed. I met Mr Smith again last week in the Steamer from New-York to Stonington, when he besieged me again for the promise of a Lyceum Lecture, which I again conditionally made— This evening to settle the whole concern—I promised I would deliver the opening Lecture on the 6th. of next month, unless some event shall occur which may put it out of my power— Charles and his wife were here this Evening— He had returned home to dine— The house of Representatives having carried through and reported to the Senate their Districting Bill, have now nothing to do, but are awaiting the action of the Senate— The great whig convention for the nomination of Governor and Lieutt Governor for the ensuing year was held in Boston— It is said there were one thousand persons present— Sundry Speeches were made—among the rest, by Osmyn Baker—Barker Burnell, and Leverett Saltonstall—three of the members of Congress from Massachusetts. The Convention with great unanimity nominated John Davis and George Hull, for re-election as Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth; and also Henry Clay as President, and John Davis as Vice-President of the United States for four years from the 3d. of March 1845.

                "text": "15. III. Thursday.  I awoke again by two in the morning with my old catarrhal cough and fever upon me as warning of what I must undertake to go through next Saturday. This reception was projected by two successive meetings of delegates from towns in the District as long ago as last June. Mr Loring of Hingham as Chairman of a Committee of arrangements wrote to me on the 25th. of July, informing me of the design, and requesting me to name a day for the performance— I answered him, and named next Saturday at 3. p.m. and since that it has been advertised in the Newspapers of the District and in several of the daily papers of Boston— All this parade and ceremony is to be made for me, and I only think how ridiculously it inflates my vanity. The Meeting is expected to be very large, but I am prepared for a disappointment in that— The weather is as unfavourable as possible, and I have no reason to expect it will be better. I know how hard it is to fill country Churches, and I do not desire a crowded auditory— But I am to be addressed face to face and to make an extemporaneous answer— I am to receive resolutions, and know not exactly what they will be; and must make some comment upon them— I am expected to make a long speech, and have every reason to fear it will disappoint expectations much too highly raised— The danger of giving offence is imminent. The power of compressing and arranging what I have to say is very severely tested— The themes are all too copious and I feel my deficiency in the art of abridging.— Mr Loring was here this morning, and agreed to meet me on Saturday soon after Noon at Minott Thayer’s house— He spoke also of a fishing party at Cohassett rocks next week, but I could not answer positively.— Mr George Brown of Beverly was here, and summoned me to the performance of what he claimed as a promise at Washington that if I should Lecture any where this Season beyond Quincy and Boston, it should be before the Lyceum at Beverly. He was very importunate with me to fix a day, but I could not—nor could I even make any positive engagement. Miss Tufts was here and invited us to tea at her mother’s on Saturday. Mr Henry Lunt, with his Son came to enquire concerning his claim for prize money on account the captures of Jones’s squadron in 1779— "

Friday  Another dull, gloomy, chilling, rainy North-easterly storm day.— My Son called this morning for the order from the Bank of the Metropolis upon the Merchants Bank at Boston which I brought with me, but could not wait till I found it— The house of Representatives had adjourned to 9 O’Clock this morning, and in the course of the morning the Legislature was prorogued to the Tuesday preceding the first Wednesday in January next— That is the formulary in this Commonwealth, for a final adjournment for the year— At the close of the ordinary winter Session of the Legislature, Congress had not passed the apportionment Bill. The Legislature therefore appointed a special Session to be held on the 7th. of this month, and a joint Committee of both houses to sit during the recess, and prepare a Bill for districting the Commonwealth, conformably to the Apportionment, which should be enacted by Congress— Charles was Chairman of the Committee on the part of the house, of this joint Committee. They met a week before the Meeting of the Legislature, and prepared a bill dividing the Commonwealth into ten Districts conformably to the Apportionment act of Congress, instead of twelve, the number, which Massachusetts has had in the House of Representatives of the United States under the census of 1830— This bill has now become the Law of the State, having been this day been signed by Governor John Davis, whereupon the special Session of the Legislature was closed by the prorogation. Charles came home to dinner—and Walter Hellen and I dined with them upon the hill.— After which, Walter and I rode to Mrs T. B. Adams’s, and took tea with her. Isaac Hull, and passed Midshipman John Quincy, two of her Sons, and her daughter Elizabeth C. are now with her and constitute her family— We came home at 8. and found Charles and his wife here— They spent the Evening here— I gave him the check of the Bank of the Metropolis for 1500 dollars, on the Merchants Bank at Boston— I was up till passed midnight, writing a closing paragraph for my address to my constituents to-morrow— I am now as well prepared for the meeting as I could be in the time— It has been oppressive upon my mind beyond every thing that I ever endured excepting in the preparation of the argument for the captives of the Amistad, and for that I had abundance of time— Very few persons will have a conception of the depth of interest that I take in this Meeting— The last act of a ten years Representation of a District the existence of which was terminated by the new districting act of yesterday and which I have served during the whole term of its existence— The valedictory is painful— Would I were equal to the occasion.

I agreed with him to meet the Committee, between 12 and 1. at Minott Thayer’s house— I rode accordingly accompanied only by Walter Hellen and about 20 minutes to 1. found at Mr Thayer’s a small number of his friends; and a collation; but we had taken one before we left home. Soon after one, the Committee came and met me at Mr Thayer. The Convention having marched in procession from the universalist church to that of Mr Perkins which is of the congregationalist orthodox denomination— At the head of the Committee was Mr Nathaniel Morton Davis of Plymouth, a member of the Governor’s Council— We proceeded to the Meeting house, where Mr Perkins in his pulpit began the ceremony with a fervid prayer. Immediately in front of the pulpit was erected a stage, on which were several clergymen and magistrates, and where the Committee took seats, and I was myself stationed.— The house was crowded in all its parts, almost to suffocation. It appeared to me one solid mass of humanity and that there was not room for one individual more to creep into— The men covered the floor and the women the galleries all round; except apart of the front gallery reserved for a choir of singers— After the prayer, Mr Davis read an Address to the Assembled company announcing to them the object of the meeting, and to me, in terms, which put me to the blush, so that I was utterly unable to reply to them. They were intended in kindness—but in fulsome praise I can take no pleasure; and it always covers me with humiliation— I shuffled off as soon as possible all reference to my former services of my administration; and addressed the meeting as my Constituents, whom I had served for the last twelve years, and from a great portion if not all of whom I am now finally to part— I spoke about three hours from 2 to 5. O’Clock, without interruption, and without a moment’s flagging of attention.— I read several of the pages that I had written, intermingled with so much extemporaneous enlargement and illustration, that the discourse was at once compact and diversified— The introductory and concluding pages which I had written enabled me to begin and finish acceptably.— Mr Sprague’s resolutions were then read and adopted without opposition— And then an Ode was sung written by the Revd. John Pierpont; to the tune of God save the king— Very flattering, but with a monitorial closing Stanza, scarcely intelligible. The meeting was then dismissed with a benediction by Mr Perkins— I then went with Walter Hellen, first to Mr Thayer’s, and afterwards with Mr Loring to Mrs Tufts’s, and at both places found good company, tea coffee and other delicate refreshments. We got home by 8. O’Clock. Charles and his wife came in soon after. "

                "text": "18. IV. Sunday.  I felt little fatigue or exhaustion yesterday after all the excitement of the day, and the exertion of speaking in public three hours without intermission, but as the evening advanced weariness came over me— The will to write two hours till midnight failed, and after a rather uneasy night, I rose this morning, with an aggravated catarrh, hoarseness of voice, and a sore throat which annoyed me the whole day and evening— But the joy of my deliverance from the burden of yesterday banishes all thought of pain. The Roman Catholics of this town, chiefly Irish labourers, and among whom John Kirk and his wife hold distinguished stations, have become so numerous that they have recently undertaken and accomplished the erection of a small church for publick worship— This morning at ten it was dedicated by Bishop Fenwick— I went with Mrs John Adams, and witnessed the ceremony. The Bishop, one priest and two choirist boys were all the performers. The house contains about 500 persons, and was all but overflowing—full as it could hold.— The Bishop in his Mitre and pontificals, followed by the priest and the two boys came out from the vestry, passed through the aisle crowded with people, went out side of the church and all round it sprinkling holy water as he went— He then came in and on his knees consecrated the altar, after which sitting down in a chair fronting the auditory, without laying aside his mitre he delivered a discourse from 2. Paraleipominon 7.11. “Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of the Lord and in his own house, he prosperously effected. 12 And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice” and so to the end of the chapter— The Bishop drew a close parallel between the building of the Temple by Solomon and the erection of this church, and promised the people all the blessings which God promised Solomon, upon the same conditions of obedience to his will, and denounced the same curses against them if they should forsake God, for the world, the flesh and the devil— The Priest then said Mass responded to by a choir of good singers. He gave notice of vespers at a quarter past 3.— The ceremonies occupied about 3 hours— Met Mrs Morton, and Sarah Apthorp there.— After dinner, at the stone Temple, Mr Ezra S. Gannett preached from Romans 6.17. [“]But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin: but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you 18. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.”— A very earnest and anxious exhortation to repentance— C Pearce Cranch with Mrs Lucy and Mrs Mary Dawes here this Evening— Also Charles and his wife.

Yesterday was the only morning of 11 days since we arrived from Washington, upon which the Sun has risen clear.— I saw him rise from the S.E corner of my Son’s house; I went again this morning; but he was veiled behind a cloud till about 5 minutes after he had risen— According to the American Almanac, the Sun rises at Boston on the 21st. of this month at 5:45. and my chronometer is precisely one hour in advance of the Sun.— I had fondly hoped that after our return from home from Washington, and especially after that meeting with my Constituents, which has weighed so heavily upon my spirits, I should be indulged with at least a short period of repose—but I had barely returned from my 30 minutes walk round the temple square, when a young man brought me a Letter from Justin Spear inviting me to attend a Pic Nic of the cold water army consisting of children in the western school district of this town, next Wednesday afternoon, and to address them. I was engaged to go to Hingham on Wednesday, and sent word to Mr Justin Spear that I was so— Then came Mr Marcus Latham for a subscription of 100 dollars to which I had put my name in the Spring of last year for the erection of a building in Cambridge, where the Alumni of Harvard University may hold their meetings and dine, the day before commencement— He had sent me the subscription book, having my name in it, last week, with a polite Letter to remind— I went up to Charles’s house—took of him a check, on the merchant’s Bank at Boston, for 100 dollars, which I gave to Mr Latham and took his receipt in full for my subscription. Visit from Revd. Peter Whitney in the last stage of caducity— Samuel P. Bailey is of South Weymouth and came to enquire if he could not obtain a pension for his mother.— I could not find the act of the late Session extending the provisions of the pension acts of 1836 and 1838. William Shaw my barber came as President of a fire company with a subscription paper for providing furniture for their fire engine. Charles Amberger Andrew came as a deputy from the Salem Lyceum, and Aaron C. Bagley as a deputy from the Lowell Lyceum inviting me to deliver introductory Lectures; in both of which cases I declined— A clergyman from a very flourishing new settlement in Michigan, came also to see me and left with me a mendicant circular for his church— Past Midshipman John Quincy Adams was here this morning, and his Sister Elizabeth dined with us.

I went for the aid of a dentist, and applied to Dr Gray, in Winter Street, who gave me what aid he could by scaling off the tartar, and tying up one of the two loose ones with a thread, but they are past all surgery, and serve me but as perpetual warnings to make ready for my final dissolution— He was an hour and a quarter in the operation, which was painful, and gave me no relief— I then called at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s house and saw Mrs Lawrence, and a daughter of Major Turnbull of Washington— Mr Lawrence was at his counting room, in Liberty square, which I could not find. My next visit was to Mr Plumbe, at his National Daguerreian Gallery 76. Court Street, to which I had been invited by a printed card from him to take a photographic miniature likeness of me. He was so much engaged that he could not take it now, but I engaged to go in again next Tuesday the 27th. at 10. O’Clock A.M which he minuted down, on a book and is then to take it.— He has a very large collection of photographs, but this wonderful invention of Daguerre yields but wretched portraits—for inferior to the Silhouette— I walked down State-street, and inspected the exchange with its granite pilasters which are completed; and the new Custom house at the head of the long wharf apparently not much more advanced than it was last year. I was met and accosted in the Street by Mr Eastburn the city printer, by Coll Thomas H. Perkins, and by the Revd. Dr W. B. Sprague of Albany, who spoke to me of the Letters which he had written me upon the subject of inter-marriage with a wife’s sister, and to which he expressed much solicitude to receive an answer— After visiting Fowle and Capen’s book-store, and two others for a suitable edition of the Pilgrim’s progress which I did not find, I repaired to Dr Frothingham’s, new house, and found there the carriage and my companions, with whom I returned home to dine— Afternoon visits from the Revd Mr Robinson the present rector of the episcopal church in this town, Deacon Spear, the Revd. William Apthorp, now a settled Minister, near Quincy, in the State of Illinois, but here on a visit to his relatives, and Messrs Russell and Greely who brought me a Letter from Solomon Lincoln, and besieged me to deliver an old Lecture before the Boston Lyceum on the 6th. of next Month, which I promised. I witnessed the clear setting of the Sun, from Charles’s house at 6.4. "

Went to see the Sunrise from Charles’s house, on the day of the equinox— It rose over Hortons bake-house, chimney; but beclouded till full five minutes risen— Immediately after breakfasting I went, with my Son, and Walter Hellen, in the Carry-all, and one horse, driven by Philip, to Mt Thomas Loring’s house at Hingham, whence I immediately proceeded with him in his chaise to Cohasset; Quincy Thaxter taking my place in the carry-all— At half past 8 we were at the fishing hovel on the rock, but there was nobody there; and the boat which Mr Loring had engaged for our fishing party—had been taken away this morning without leave by certain gunners from Braintree— Another boat was however procured by Mr Loring in the course of an hour, in which my son and myself, with Dr. Brewer the Editor of the Boston Atlas, and Mr Barnes, went out to fish for perch— The boat was very small, and another, somewhat larger, with a sail soon after came up, and we passed over into her— I was very desirous of fishing for cod; but the weather was lowering the boat very leaky, and there was no inclination to go 4 or 5 miles off from the shore as would have been necessary to fish successfully for cod— We kept therefore close within shore and changing our position twice we caught about 6 dozen of Sea perch with a due portion of Sculpins and pollock—one haddock, which we returned to its elements and one small cod which I caught— At one, upon a signal from the shore, we landed and dined upon a very good chowder— There were now about 15 persons present from Hingham, Cohasset and Boston, among whom were deacon Samuel Greele of Boston, a member of the State Legislature, Mr Doane of Cohasset and sundry others— We had lemonade and coffee at dinner, and a single bottle of Madeira wine— After dinner, a schoolmaster with his whole school; upwards of 30 boys and girls came from Cohasset, for the sole purpose of seeing J. Q. Adams—very aukward— There was a heavy shower, which hastened us homeward— We had an invitation to tea and for the evening at Mr Baker’s, and we reached his house in Hingham about 5. p.m. soon after which the sky cleared up— Mrs Baker, two daughters and a son constituted Mr Baker’s family. The Ladies received us, but soon retired and a party of between 30 and forty men came in succession from 5 to 8 in the Evening when we left them and returned as we had gone out, home to Quincy. Tea and Coffee with a bountiful supply of bread and butter, and a profuse variety of cakes were served round, and several enquiries of political bearing were put to me, for the purpose of drawing me out into loquacity, which it did very largely. Mexico and Texas formed a principal subject of the Conversation— The evening Temple Bell at Quincy was telling 9 as we approached it— Mrs Charles was here. "

I recur to the period of his birth with mingled feelings of anguish and of joy. Will devout supplication to the giver of all good, obtain the prayer that this child may live, to bear and carry down the name to after generations brightening as it descends? So may it be! I gave him James’s Life of Edward the black Prince— There had been here yesterday two gentlemen from Charlestown a deputation to invite me to deliver the introductory Lecture before the Charlestown Lyceum— Two others came this morning— Mr Tolman Willey, and Mr Hutchins— I was obliged to decline— A man named Buckminster, Editor of a weekly Newspaper published at Boston, called the American Ploughman, came to solicit my subscription, which I also declined. He thought it strange that I should be unwilling to patronize agriculture. An old man 80 years of age, came to see me; for the pleasure of having it to say that he had once in his life seen a President of the United States— He had a wild staring eye, and spoke like a man of unsettled mind— I enquired where he lived, and he said he had no particular place of residence, but that he had a son living and doing business in Boston. He finally enquired if I had any Razors that I wanted to have set—intimated that this was his peculiar vocation, and that he had a remarkably fine hone— As I cannot shave myself I had no occasion for this service, and he went away. My son came and we had some discourse respecting the final settlement of my fathers Estate and Execution of his last Will— All the heirs and devisees have been settled with, except Joseph Harrod Adams, my brother Thomas’s youngest son who came of age 16 December 1838. and to whom the payment in full of the bequest to him, has been deferred for various considerations till this day.— My son is now remitting the funds to him at Washington— President Quincy has yet one mortgage of my Court Street Estate in Boston, and two bonds for the execution of the bequests in my father’s will—which must all be taken up before the settlement can be completed— For all this we made arrangements this day.— The weather is so rough and raw that I had no temptation to make an excursion round the farm, or to lounge in my garden and nursery— From Charles’s house, I saw the Sun set clear, precisely at 6.— I am still under an enormous pressure for an Address to the Norfolk County Society for the suppression of Intemperance, next Thursday, and for a Lecture before the Boston Lyceum on the 6th. of next Month— The various avocations of the day consumed so much of it that I was obliged to devote to writing the Evening while my Son, and his wife were here.

Mr M’Kean is the son of Dr Joseph M’Kean a graduate at Harvard of 1794. sometime Minister of a congregational church at Milton, and afterwards my successor as Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Cambridge, but many years since deceased— I recognized the son from his resemblance to his father.— He is now a member and Secretary of the New York Mercantile Library Association, and came to enquire if I could deliver a Lecture before them, on my way to Washington— I told him I had been obliged to decline that, and many other invitations, and had promised if I could Lecture at all at New-York this Season, it should be for the Lyceum— Mr John A. Green editor of the Quincy Patriot came to talk with me about my Address to my constituents last Saturday, a report of which will be expected in his paper to-morrow. Green for the last three years has been a professed democrat, but still holding an insidious course towards me, and towards the whig party— None but my friends were invited to the Meeting at Braintree, but Green was there and acted as one of the Secretaries— He came to tell me that he should not give much of the proceedings in the paper to-morrow. He should give Mr Sprague’s Resolutions and Mr Pierpont’s Ode— Next week he proposed to give Mr Nathaniel M Davis’s address to me, and the week after my Speech as Dr. Brewer has promised to publish it in the Boston Atlas, as I shall write it out. Green’s talk is jesuitical and treacherous like his paper— He had in it last week a Letter from his Boston correspondent puffing Captain Tyler’s veto of the Tariff bill, as the sublimest state paper that ever was written— I asked him how he could publish such ribaldry— He said his Boston correspondent was fishing for an office— Mr Shepperd of New-Orleans, with his daughter Mrs Gorham Brooks and her little son Shepperd came out from Medford, visited us before dinner, and Walter Hellen and I dined with them at Charles’s house— They left us immediately after dinner to return home this evening to Medford— Ruth Turner was here at work mantua-making all day— I was much interrupted and perplexed in my writing—but finished my Letter to Henry Clay, and pondered upon Temperance till Evening.

Briggs at Washington, where he was detained after the close of the late Session by a bilious fever, he gave me a warm invitation to the Cattle show, and fair in his county of Berkshire, which was to be held the first week in October— Though I had little expectation of being able to go, I did not refuse, and yesterday I received a letter from him very earnestly urging and pressing the invitation— I have an aversion almost amounting to abhorrence to attendance at all public meetings for speech making; and avoid them as I would a pestilence— Yet the fashion of holding them spreads and multiplies all over this country to such a degree that I have neither leisure nor quiet, and am kept on continual agitation to escape from them— Having engaged to deliver a Lecture at Boston on the Evening of the 6th. of October, I cannot attend at Pittsfield on the 5th. I wrote accordingly to Mr Briggs.— The sun rose clear this morning, which I witnessed from the S. E. corner of Charles’s house; there was a white frost on the ground and my thermometer was at 30— The day was cloudless in the perfection of autumnal beauty— I wrote assiduously and without interruption all the morning but my Industry flagged before dinner— I visited my garden and nursery— My seedling Oaks, shagbark walnuts, maples, and Baldwin apple trees are flourishing— Most of the others have perished. My interest in plantations languishes— The next century is beyond my reach— Charles brought me three quarterly accounts which must occupy some of my time. Deacon Spear was here this afternoon, enquiring whether I would purchase a small woodlot of Henry Hardwick’s, locked within mine 7 or 8 acres for which he asks 26 dollars an acre just shorn of its wood— I told the deacon I would give 20 dollars an acre for it, and I thought no more— I strolled out after dinner, and found Charles, with John Kirk and Dennis Mooney at work upon his stone wall which he is extending round the enlarged lot surrounding his house— While out I walked over to Mr John Greenleaf’s and found both him and his wife, youthified since I saw them last, about this time— He is blind, deaf, cheerful, and 80 years of age— She is 75, twice within the last five years, supposed to be dying of a slow, incurable fever, and now active and apparently in health. Their daughters Lucy Dawes, and Mary Dawes, with a double tribe of children live with them. Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us. I would have written, but it was cold. "

[“]For they loved the praise of men, more than the praise of God.” A practical dissertation upon one of the infirmities of human nature which Christianity has by no means extirpated; and the preacher well admonished his auditory, when they indulge their astonishment at the pusillanimity of the chief rulers among the Jews, who believed in Jesus but dared not confess him, for fear of the Pharisees, and of being put out of the Synagogue, not to be too confident that they themselves would not under like circumstances do precisely the same— The afternoon Sermon was from Revelation 11.17. “Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come”; omitting the remainder of the verse; “because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned”— The subject of the discourse was Eternity as one of the attributes of God— The contemplation is perplexing— The only conception we can form of Eternity, is of Time indefinitely extended—past—present—future, all which necessarily implies succession, as succession imports change— The power of omnipotence is incomprehensible otherwise than as exercised in the succession of time, and yet the succession of Time confounds all ideas of eternity— Mr Lunt gave notice that the communion would be administered next Sunday. My time presses upon me beyond endurance— In reflecting upon this address to the Society for the suppression of intemperance in the County of Norfolk, I have undertaken to trace the Scripture theory concerning Temperance as a question of morals.— I was engaged upon it during all the leisure of this day— We had evening visits from Dr and Mrs Woodward, and from Archibald Campbell, John Foster and Isaac Hull Adams— I received also this evening a note from Dutee J. Pearce, at the Hancock house, notifying me of his arrival there, and asking an interview with me to-morrow— I answered inviting him to breakfast with me to morrow Morning.— The engagement that I have contracted to defend him before the Superior Court of the State of Rhode-Island, upon an indictment for Treason, is one of those distressing and humiliating incidents of my Life, which seem to come upon me, as by a fatality, to bring home to my bosom the conviction how far beyond my strength they are.

Pearce came this morning, not to breakfast, but immediately after—accompanied by Burrington Anthony, heretofore Marshal of the United States in the judicial District of Rhode-Island, and one of the principal actors in the recent troubles and revolutionary movements of that State— He left Mr Pearce with me, and we had a conversation of two hours upon his present condition. He left with me a copy of the Indictment found against him for treason; in which there are four counts, the overt act charged in them all being the same—namely assuming to exercise the legislative functions, of the office of member of the House of Representatives of the State, not being duly elected there to according to the Laws of the State, but under a pretended Constitution of Government— The second Count charges that he with other false traitors to the jurors unknown, did assemble, and vote and assent to sundry Laws and acts of pretended legislation— The third count charges assembling with others, not being duly elected to exercise the Legislative authority—and the fourth has the same charge, with the addition of the pretended constitution— The date of the offence charged in the first and fourth count is the third, and in the second and third Counts the fourth of May. 1842 In the event of a trial, which is quite uncertain, but if held at all, will be in the last week of next Month, Mr Pearce wished me to act as his closing counsel, and I promised so to undertake— Several questions were started between us concerning the Law of Treason as arising from the case— But we had not time to go largely into them. There was one as to the legality of holding the trial at Newport; but this he said would be decided next week— Mr Charles Bradley resides in Maryland, but was born in Boston, and is here on a visit to his relations— He came to see me as a curiosity— Mr Loring came with a request to me from Mr Fearing that I would deliver an Address to the whig association in Boston— I told him that I might perhaps comply with this request hereafter—but certainly could not within the next three weeks. Mr Congdon came from New-Bedford, to request a Lecture before the Lyceum there. I could not give a decisive answer— He was extremely kind and civil to us, when we visited New-Bedford in 1835. I called this day before dinner at Gill the book-binders, with my Diary Vol. 16. and at Mrs T. B. Adams to deliver Letters to Elizabeth and John Quincy— "

Adams—which I note now, having by inadvertence omitted to note it then— This morning we had visits from Mr Quincy, President of Harvard University with his wife— He spoke of the Observatory which they have erected at Cambridge, and of a new subscription for a Telescope, to cost 6000 dollars, and for which the glass is to be procured at Munich in Germany, and the instrument to be made in London— He mentioned also the new building for the annual meetings of the Alumni the first of which took place the day before the last Commencement. Judge Story delivered the discourse which is highly commended. Mr Ichabod Goodwin of Portsmouth New Hampshire came, and invited me to visit that town, and deliver a lecture there—and after dinner Mr Justin Spear and George Newcome came to make a final arrangement with me, about my attendance at the Meeting of the Norfolk County Society for the suppression of intemperance. The Society are to meet at 9 in the Morning at the town hall, for the transaction of business, and the choice of Officers— Between 12 and 1. they will come in procession to my house, and I am to proceed with them to a pavilion, under which is to be a cold collation, after which we are to proceed to the Universalist Meeting house, and there, I am to deliver my Address—to be succeeded by other speakers— To all this I agreed; although the motives of this invitation to me, I have reason to believe were neither of kindness to me, nor of purling stream purity. This evening Mrs T. B. Adams, with her two sons and two daughters, her sister Mrs Foster, Charles, with his wife and daughter, Mary Harrod, Archibald Campbell and C. Pearce Cranch, spent with us: and the young men, Campbell, I. Hull Adams and Cranch, entertained us with songs and accompaniment of the Piano. I had been engaged all day, with these repeated interruptions, in writing for my Temperance address to morrow, excessively dissatisfied with what I had written—aware that it will suit neither the passions, prejudices, nor tactics of the auditory which I am to address. After our company was gone this evening a thought occurred to me, of an interpolation to bind the parts of the discourse together, which kept me up in writing it, till Midnight. "

Mr Colver, a baptist minister, with Mr Dennison of the Baptist theological institution at Newtown, and a Mrs Green— Soon after 12. O’Clock there came to my house a procession of about 500 persons, with a band of music and the Revd. John Pierce of Brookline D.D. at their head. I met them at my gate; and he said he had been this morning elected President of the Norfolk County Temperance Society; and that they had come to escort me to the pavilion where they were to dine— Justin Spear, George Newcome, the Revd. William M. Cornell ex-Minister of the orthodox congregational church and the Revd. John Gregory, Minister of the Universalist church, were in the procession— We marched, sonorous metal blowing martial sounds to the pavilion adjoining the Town hall in Coddington Street, to which the Town hall itself has been since last winter removed— Under the pavilion, a cold dinner or collation was prepared on a trident table of several hundred covers; every plate of which was occupied, with a profusion of pitchers full of cold water to drink— Mr John Pierpont said grace before meat, and Mr Colver returned thanks; No toasts after dinner, but much discussion whether there should be or not— The dinner lasted about an hour, and the procession then proceeded to the Universalist Meeting house, which the pilgrims of the procession filled to the brim The discourses were all delivered in the pulpit— They were interspersed with the singing of Temperance hymns— Mr Pierce presided. Mr Pierpont made the introductory prayer— Mr Pierce then gave a Sentiment in honour of the town of Quincy; first intended as a toast for the dinner; and somewhat aukwardly introduced me to the auditory— I then read my address, which occupied just one hour in the delivery— It was listened to with deep and undivided attention, and faintly applauded at the close, but did not suit the Society before which I spoke, nor their doctrines of total abstinence from the use of wine, which I neither approve nor practice— Extemporaneous addresses followed from Edmund Quincy, Mr Pierpont, Mr Colver, who made the concluding prayer, and by two other persons; all urging the principle of total abstinence, and pronouncing ludicrous invectives upon wine, fermentation, distillation, alcohol arsenic—also upon Rumsellers, traders in ardent spirits and spruce beer. Quincy was solemn and tragical— Pierpont, facetious and farcical; the others rude and radical— Notice was given of another meeting with addresses at 7. O’Clock this evening at the Orthodox Meeting house— Our Meeting was dismissed with a blessing by Dr. Pierce, after the adoption of several Resolutions— As I walked home I was overtaken, by Edmond Quincy, going home to Dedham, in his wagon chaise.

This was the first day since I reached home from Washington that I have enjoyed any thing like relaxation from involuntary labour, and it was soon absorbed in the promise to write out my speech made at Weymouth on the 17th. Much of the day was consumed in bringing up and assorting my file of Letters yet unanswered and the daily record, yesterday untouched— On recurring to my speech, I found a work of heavy labour before me to finish? it out; and I made very little progress in it.— I visited my garden and Nursery—and gathered a number of acorns from the trees of the English white Oaks which bear them in great profusion— I planted ten of them immediately in a row in the small patch South of the entrance into the garden from the kitchen gate. There are four of those trees in that patch from acorns planted there two years ago.— The great difficulty of raising these trees from the acorn, and also the shagbark hickory from the nut, is that when planted in the fall the seedling does not come up till July or August of the next year; then it has not time to grow in the course of the Season, so as to form a top bud that will survive the first winter— The stem is killed down to the ground by the frost, and the next Summer, throws out two or three slender shoots from the root, which again pass through the same process. Never attaining growth sufficient to abide the frost of the following winter—yet retaining sufficient vitality at the root to throw out annual shoots to languish through the Summer, and perish by the next Winter’s frost.— I have seen them drag along a puny life of six or seven years till a sharper winter than usual kills both root and stem— I suppose there is some remedy for these abortions, but I have not the wit to find it out— Mr Andrew came again to urge me to deliver a Lecture before the Salem Lyceum, which I could not promise to do; and which I had not resolution positively to refuse. I gave Mrs Charles Adams a little manuscript of extracts which I made at Newbury-Port in July 1790. from Sir Charles Grandison. Mrs Angier, Elizabeth C. Adams, Lucy Greenleaf, a daughter of Jacob Norton of Lowell, and Christopher P. Cranch were here this morning—and Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us. "

I was strolling in my garden and nursery, gathering English white oak acorns, and trimming some of my other seedling trees, when I was called into a visit from Mr Lunt— Passed Midshipman my namesake and William Johnson of Utica, were also here the latter of whom came from the Law school at Cambridge to pass the Sunday with us—After dinner Dr Brewer one of the Editors of the Boston Atlas, called, being on his return from Boston to Hingham where he is passing the Summer. He came to urge me to furnish him as soon as possible with a copy of my address at Weymouth on the 17th. of last month— A number of the principal whigs of Boston, during his visit to his farm at Marshfield, gave him an invitation to a public dinner, which he declined, and proposed as a substitute a meeting at Faneuil Hall, where he might exchange greetings with all his fellow citizens, who might be so disposed— This meeting was accordingly held yesterday— The Mayor of the City presided and addressed him in a highly complimentary style, which he answered by a Speech, which was received by a crowded hall, with every external show of enthusiastic applause, but which was bitter as wormwood to nearly the whole of the whig party, and sweeter than honey to the radical democracy.— Boastful, cunning Jesuitical, fawning and insolent, ambiguous in its givings out, avowing his determination not to let them know whether he intends to resign his office or not, arguing all sorts of reasons for his retaining it, but intimating that he may perhaps release his grasp upon it; dealing open blows at the late whig convention for their Resolution of total severance from John Tyler, and sly stabs at Clay and me, without naming either of us, the whole purport of his speech was to propitiate the Democracy, and to split up the whigs, and out of the two fragments to make a Tyler party. I promised Dr Brewer to write out my speech as soon as possible, and that I thought I could have it ready in the course of a week— Caleb Cushing too has had a magnificent reception at Newbury-Port; and the signs of the Tyler party are much stronger than I could have imagined. Brewer told me that he had several Letters from Caleb Cushing against me—particularly written last winter, arguing that the Southern Slave dealers were right, and I was wrong in all the proceeding upon the right of petition— Mr Smith of New York Secretary to the Lyceum came towards Sunset, with his Sister, and pressed me with great importunity to deliver another Lecture for them on my way to Washington, next Month. I positively declined apparently much to his mortification. Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us, and Mr Johnson stays this night— I wrote till near Midnight. "

[“]The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 26. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.” There is no doubt that the woman of Samaria so understood him, but the words of the original are only I am. The english word he is supernumerary— Mr Lunt did not undertake to assign the reason why Jesus Christ revealed himself so directly and expressly as the Messiah, to this Samaritan woman.— It does not appear that she became one of his disciples or ever saw him afterwards— Mr Lunt considered the personal character of Christ, and the incidents of his life as identified with his religion, and that Christ and Christianity are one. Mr Lunt administered the communion. Mr Whitney was present, and partook of it, but took no part in the performance. The infirmities of age have grown upon him, within this last year, more than they had done in five years before— His eldest son, George who was colleague to Doctor Thomas Gray, of Jamaica plains Roxbury, died last winter, and his youngest daughter Mary nearly about the same time was married to Richard Cranch Greenleaf who keeps a shop in Boston. He would be entirely solitary, but that his sister, widow of the late Ebenezer Adams lives with him— In the afternoon Mr Joseph Angier of Milton preached from 2. Corinthians 3.16 [“]But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord”—and 4.6 [“]For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness both shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.” There is something mystical in the text not easy to be understood, and there was more in the discourse— The annual collection forgotten in the morning was taken up in the afternoon, and Mr Whitney just made out to give notice that hereafter for the winter, the morning service will commence at half past 10. and the afternoon at a quarter before 2. Mr George W. Beale and his two daughters spent the evening with us. Also Charles and his wife. Mr Beale approves of Mr Webster speech last Friday. "

Clear skies, occasionally cross’d by transient clouds which gather and disperse from day to day; a warm and genial sun travers in the arch of Heaven from morn to night, with cool and almost frosty Nights and Fahrenheits thermometer averaging 40. just before Sunrise, invite me to stroll about the farm, while urgent occupations still bear with oppressive weight— I have not yet one hour of leisure. My speech of the 17th. ulto. is growing insufferably long— Mr Samuel P. Loud. in 1809 a student in my Office at Boston, now and for many years past, an inhabitant of Dorchester, came with Mr M’Kendry of that town to request me to deliver the introductory Lecture before their Lyceum in the course of the present month. I declined with a reservation that if before my return to Washington I should be able to make a leisure day or evening, I will give notice of it to Mr Loud, and comply with the invitation— Dr Gray and Mr Nathaniel Curtis of Jamaica Plains also paid me an afternoon visit— Dr Gray looks as if he was rapidly reaching the seventh age of life. He says that my Classmate Dr. Peter Eaton is the oldest clergyman in this Commonwealth; and that he himself is the next— Harvey Field was my next visitor and he brought with him his Son, six years old, named after me— Field is a man of strong natural parts, which for lack of proper culture bears more weeds than wholesome plants— He was for three years a member of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth but has been superseded by others for the last four or five— About five weeks since he received a kick from a horse which knocked out four or five of his upper teeth—knocked in as many under teeth and nearly broke the bridge of his nose— He is recovering only in part— He came to treat with me for my Quincy 6. Acre Meadow. I ask him 2500 dollars for it— He offers 1500 and we are not likely to agree— I saw the Sun rise, and set from Charles’s house— Evening visits from Mrs. Morton, Miss Sarah Apthorp, and Mrs Robinson, wife of the new episcopal minister who has recently take the place of Mr Wolcott. Charles and his wife spent the Evening here. "

The Lady is his second wife, and is a Sister of Mr Doane of Cohasset— The General inclines favourably to Webster’s speech, which will undoubtedly breed an irreconcileable schism in the whig party, and in all probality break them up in this State— His courtship of the democracy is lascivious. And he evidently relies upon his transition to them. Next after them came Epes Sargent now an inhabitant of New-York— A young man of some poetic fame, and author of two Tragedies— He came to ask me to furnish an Article for a monthly magazine which he is about to establish in New-York, and the first number of which is to be published in December, like most others of these applications to me for Lectures, Addresses or Articles, his earnestness was intense and he seemed inclined to take no denial— This Spirit is flattering and humiliating. Its tendency is to make me fancy myself popular and to mistake notoriety for fame. I have no article on hand which I should be willing to have now published; and certainly nothing which could add a particle even to my notoriety— It occurred to me at last that an Article might be made out of my English version of Lord Wellesley’s Latin lines upon Milton, and my correspondence with him and Mr M’Tavish on the subject— He was delighted with the proposal and I allowed him to take copies of my Letter to Mr M Tavish of 20. April 1841 with the lines, and of my Letters to Mr M’Tavish and to Lord Wellesley of 16. Decr. 1841. with liberty to publish them— He said that Mr Charles Sumner had a copy of the first edition of Lord Wellesley’s volume, where he could find the original lines upon Milton, and I promised him copies of Lord Wellesley’s and Mr M’Tavish’s Letters to me, on my return to Washington. Mr S. B. Pond of New-York, with Mr Tolman of Boston came this afternoon, with an invitation to me from a Committee of the New-York Academy of sacred Music inviting me to deliver a Lecture in the Broadway Tabernacle, on the importance of general education and of music as one of the particular branches— Mr Pond brought also a recommendatory letter from William L Stone— I have received no invitation, with which I should so much delight to comply as with this; but I was compelled to decline—and well for me that I was, for the attempt would be a failure— Walter Hellen left us this morning for an excursion to Portland and Bangor. Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us. "

There was a long strip of cloud, about two thirds of the width of a disk bordering Southeastward on the horizon, which intercepted the first beams of the rising Sun— The rest of the sky was cloudless, and continued so through the day and evening— I drudged along in the work of writing out my Weymouth speech, hardly seeming to draw near its close— This afternoon Mr Jotham Lincoln, and Mr Lewis of Hingham called here on their return from Dedham, where they had been to attend a convention of whig delegates from the towns of the newly constituted 8th. Congressional District of the Commonwealth; it consists of all the towns, 22 in the County of Norfolk, with the towns of Hingham, Abington, North Bridgwater and Hull, in Plymouth County, and Brighton, Natick, Newton Sherburne and Holliston in Middlesex. 31. Towns— 11. of which are in the late 12th. Congressional district— 14 Towns in Norfolk, 5 in Middlesex, and 1. in Plymouth are added to make the district— 13 of the towns in Plymouth County which I have represented are take away and allotted to another district— Mr Lincoln said that the delegation from the towns was numerous, and that the nomination of me was unanimous; no other person being named— It was made viva voce— Sundry resolutions were adopted, and a Committee appointed to inform me of my nomination; of which Minott Thayer is chairman— The other members of the Committee are Samuel H. Walley of Roxbury who presided at the Convention, and Mr Brigham of this town— Mr. Thayer was afterwards here; but I was at Charles’s on the hill where with my wife and Mrs John Adams I took tea, and spent the Evening. Mr Thayer proposed that the Committee should come to inform me of my nomination next Monday afternoon— This nomination by the whigs furnishes by no means conclusive evidence of what turn the election may take— The democracy have the majority in the County of Norfolk— Their convention for the nomination of a candidate is to be held next Tuesday— Besides which there is a strong abolition party in the District, and a considerable portion if not the whole of that party will not vote for me, but for a candidate of their own— They have defeated an election in the 9th. district consisting chiefly of the same towns; and they may if they please defeat the election of the 8th district to the next Congress— Nothing is more uncertain— I continued to be harassed with invitations to deliver Lectures, and this day received an invitation from Josiah Foster, William Stutson, Charles C. P. Waterman, Melatiah Bourne, William Fessenden junr, Elisha Pope, and R. B. Gibbs, in behalf of the whigs at Sandwich. to meet them at a public dinner, any time during the course of this month—Also a Letter from Leverett Saltonstall, cordially inviting me to his house in the event of my delivering a Lecture at Salem— These invitations are so numerous, that I have not even time to answer many of them.

The border of clouds along the horizon, from E.S.E. to S.S.E. while the rest of the sky was cloudless, intercepted for about 10 minutes the sight of the rising Sun; but the day was clear and the temptation to range abroad for air and exercise abridged the time that I could devote to writing.— While we were at dinner Mr Jacob Bachelder came, deputed from the Lyceum at Lynn, to repeat the invitation of several successive years, for a lecture— I had promised one last Autumn, which my eruption on the head prevented me from delivering. There were then two rival Lyceums each claiming the performance of my promise, and now there is another invitation from an Association of young men in Lynn, which comes in collision with this one from the Lyceum— I gave Mr Bachelder an indecisive answer, but promised to make it certain as soon as possible— Novariski was a mendicant Polander, roaming about with recommendatory Letters. Mr Foster and his daughter Mary paid us a short afternoon visit from Boston— Early after dinner I found myself dosing as I sat writing at my table as now frequently happens—old age and physical nature sinks under the effort to occupy every moment of my time with useful labour— I went forth, ranging over what my father used to call Stonyfield hill; but from which he removed so many stones, and out of which my Son Charles has blasted so many rocks, that it may now with more propriety be called Greenfield hill.— From the fragments of the rocks Charles has also built round a large portion of the lot a Stone wall, which may last a century, but which may more probably within that time be broken up for house lots or cut through for Streets. In my walk I found John Kirk and Dennis Mooney, digging up potatoes a field of which was planted on part of this same lot—Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us, and the two passed midshipmen John Quincy and Joseph Harrod Adams were here— Joseph came in last Evening upon a leave of absence from Washington— The typhus congestive fever is prevailing there severely.— In the evening I resumed my writing out of my speech at Weymouth—where wilds immeasurably spread, seem lengthening as I go. I answered the Letter from Justin Spear, and 4 others Committee of the Temperance Society asking for a copy of my address. "

Saturday  Went to Boston to Mr Abbott Lawrence’s annual agricultural dinner— I wished very much to have some conversation with him alone and went in before 12. to call and see him at his counting house, but he was not there— I met in the Streets, Joseph T. Buckingham, Editor of the Courier, Captain Freeman of the Marine Corps, who was going this afternoon for Washington to remonstrate with the Secretary of the Navy against the order assigning him to the station at Norfolk Virginia, instead of Pensacola against which he had remonstrated successfully some weeks since on account of his health. He has occupied the station here these ten years, and finds it very comfortable— He attributes both the orders assigning new stations to him, to the personal malevolence of Coll. Henderson. Mr Ellis of Dedham said he would come to see me at Quincy to talk about pensions Doctor Francis Parkman spoke of the funeral obsequies yesterday of Dr William E. Channing who died a few days since of a typhus fever at Bennington in Vermont. and of Dr Channing last shot at Slavery, an Address delivered at Lenox on the first of August last, the anniversary of the final abolition of Slavery, in the British Colonies.— I went to the Office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court of this Commonwealth to enquire if copies were kept in the archives of the Charges by the Chief Justice to the Grand Jury, but I was informed that no copies of such charges were kept. I wanted to see a charge of Chief Justice Dana, delivered in 1791. 2. or 3. I stop’d at the chambers of the historical Society to see if I could not find the charge in a newspaper of the time; but the doors were locked— I paid a visit to Dr George Parkman, and saw him and Mrs Parkman—their son, and daughter. Also a young man from Philadelphia, named Colman. Dr Parkman walked with me to my Son’s new house in Mount Vernon Street to which he moved last winter after his return from Washington— I merely looked in to the lower rooms— Dined at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s with the company in the margin. Before dinner, Mr George T. Bigelow, Mr Eustis and Mr Healy came as a deputation to invite me to deliver a political address to the young men’s whig association, which I promised to do on Wednesday the 26th. of this month— Mr Lawrence’s dinner was pleasant— H. G. Otis was in fine health and Spirits— He and John Welles and Mr P. C. Brooks formed a quaternion of more than 300 years. Soon after 6. O’Clock I left the table, went to Bigelow’s stable, where I had met Frank Amory. I reached home before 8. "

I was not aware when I rose, how much of the night remained before Sunrise: but I sat down to work as soon as I was dressed, an operation which takes me from half an hour to an hour every morning and I had not one minute to spare throughout the day— Mr Lunt preached, this forenoon from Psalm 51.6. “Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts”— It was a funeral discourse on the decease of Dr William Ellery Channing, and a noble tribute of honour to his Memory.— He spoke in general terms of his early writings, and of the general character of his mind and of his compositions— He was one of the most eminent writers upon religion, morals and politics that this country has produced— Writing always in the genuine spirit of Christianity, with the tenderness of a father to his children; and always looking to the improvement and purification of the human character, especially in the humbler and indigent classes of the community— His recent labours have been chiefly confined to promoting the cause of universal liberty, and the extinction of Slavery and the Slave-trade throughout the Earth— Mr Lunt did him ample justice on this point. He gave a short extract from the last Address delivered at Lenox on the first day of last August and spoke of it in terms of enthusiastic applause— This was very creditable to Mr Lunt, in as much as Dr Channing’s course has on this subject has been too bold and anti-servile for the timid and the time serving friends of freedom— Dr. Channing never flinched or quailed before the enemy— But he was deserted by many of his followers, and lost so many of his parishioners that he had yielded to his colleague E. S. Gannett, the whole care of his pastoral Office, giving up all claim to salary, and reserving only the privilege of occasionally preaching to them at his convenience— The loss of Dr Channing to the anti-slavery cause is irreparable— Mr Lunt’s afternoon sermon was from Matthew 26.24. The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! he omitted the remainder of the verse—It had been good for that man if he had not been born— The believers in eternal punishment draw momentous inferences from that averment— Mr Whitney was in the pulpit all day, and made the prayer before sermon this afternoon; but he could hardly articulate so as to be heard— My attention was so much dissipated that I retained the memory of scarcely any thing, and am under great depression of spirits.

They wished me to introduce Mr Choate. I told them I would give them an answer in two or three days—taking time to reflect upon consequences— Mr Lewis Bass came to invite me to deliver the introductory Lecture to the winter course before the Quincy Lyceum, and I promised to deliver it on Wednesday evening of next week the 19th. of this month— Lloyd G. Horton, is the President of the Lyceum this year. Mr Whitney paid us a visit this morning—feeble and tottering— Mr Browne came from Salem with a Letter of introduction from L. Saltonstall. With him was Mr Dalton, who had already invited me to deliver a Lecture before the Salem charitable mechanic association— This is not the Lyceum, but quite another institution. I could not give a definitive answer but promised one soon.— After dinner Mr Benjn F.

Bigelow a short Letter, withdrawing my promise to address the Boston whig association, on the 27th. of this month— I found this absolutely necessary to justify a refusal to attend at any public political meeting before my return to Washington— I accordingly wrote an answer declining an invitation to a public dinner at Sandwich, and on turning over my letters recently received, to endorse and file them, I found one which I had totally forgotten from Clarkson Crolius junr and E. D. West, Aldermen, and William Dodge an Assistant Alderman of New-York, Committee of invitations for the Common Council of that city inviting me to a festival to be held on the 14th. of this month in celebration of the introduction of the Croton water into the City— There was on the note a twice repeated request for an answer, which I had overlooked till now— I answered the Letter declining the invitation, and sent it to Gillett to be taken by him to morrow morning to Boston, and put into the post-office so that it may reach New-York on Thursday, the day before the feast— My unceasing drudgery in writing out the supplement to my Weymouth speech, continues unabated and has come to a blister my fingers— I stole half an hour to plant a second row of English white Oak acorns fresh gathered from the tree; in the patch at the N. West corner of the house— Also some acorns and horse chesnuts in the seminary—Most of the white Oak Acorns shrivel up even before falling from the tree— They also change their colour from green to brown; and after changing their colour float upon water— Most of the green ones barely sink. Towards evening Mr Grinnell of New-Bedford, and Mr Tuck of Nantucket came; the former with a pressing invitation to attend a public meeting of whigs in Bristol County next week on Wednesday, and address them—at or near Taunton, and with another invitation to me to visit my friends at New Bedford, both of which I declined— Sunset clear at 5.28— Charles and his wife spent the evening here— The multitude of applications to me to deliver addresses and Lectures, with which I cannot comply has brought me to the conclusion of returning in the first week of next month to Washington, to see if I can obtain a few days of leisure and repose there. Charles at my request saw Mr Choate at Boston this morning— He does not consider himself as having made any engagement to come out and deliver an Address to the whigs of Quincy— Nor does he expect that I should attend and introduce him— With regard to his opinions he was quite reserved.

Mr Thomas Adams junr. and Mr Horton came this morning for my answer to their invitation to me, to attend a meeting of the whigs of Quincy, and introduce to them Mr Choate, who has promised to make them a speech— I told them that I had come to the conclusion that I could not with propriety attend—first because I had invariably since I had held the Office of President of the United States forborne attending and taking part in any electioneering public meeting, and secondly because I know not what the sentiments of Mr Choate were and perhaps he might express opinions with which I might not concur; and then I should be held responsible for his opinions, or under the necessity of contesting them which would tend rather to dissension than to harmony among the whigs— They acquiesced in my determination— But enquired anxiously if it was true that I had declared it as my opinion that Thomas W. Dorr was now the lawful Governor of Rhode Island— I told them certainly not. It is a lie, published in the Boston Morning Post, originating in my having undertaken to defend Dutee J. Pearce as his Council on his trial for Treason. I told them that my Son had at my request seen Mr Choate, who had told him that he had not expected that I should be present at the Meeting here at which he proposed to address the whigs— Mr Ephraim Randall is an unsettled unitarian Minister, who has been settled, at New-Bedford and afterwards at Westford—but is now at large, unoccupied and living on a small farm at Dorchester.— He is in want of employment and of subsistence for the winter, and came to enquire if there would be any chance for him to obtain an engagement upon very moderate terms to serve the small unitarian church at Fishkill landing and at the same time to keep a school or to teach church music. I gave him no encouragement, but told him I would ascertain and inform him if he would call again in the course of a fortnight— Dr. Brewer was here this afternoon— Anxious to obtain the copy of my speech at Weymouth— As it will be too long to publish entire in one paper, I gave him the sybil leaves of about one half of it, to publish by next Monday, and must have the remainder of it ready for him to be published a day or two after— He promised to send me a proof sheet for revisal before the publication— Mrs Brewer was with him but did not alight. Walter Hellen returned this evening from his excursion to Portland and Bangor, much pleased with his visit to Mr Moody the brother of Adele’s husband. Mary and Mrs Charles went to Boston.   "

Mr John Campbell, heretofore, Minister of the 2d presbyterian Church, but now settled at Albany both urging me to come— With them was a Letter from Mr Hooper C. van Vorst, corresponding Secretary of the Association said to number upwards of one thousand young men.

S. Train, President of the Lyceum at Haverhill asking for a Lecture there— One from Charles R.

O’Clock— This afternoon, Betsey Baxter who nearly forty years ago lived with my mother as a house maid but is now an old lady living with her brother in Boston, and Mrs Elijah Baxter a daughter of Deacon William Spear came to see us—and Mrs Swift, Mrs Davis, Mrs Tucker and another Lady in the place of Miss Ann Rowe, came with a written invitation of themselves and as deputies from the Ladies of Milton to attend a meeting of a Pic-Nic, next Thursday afternoon at 4. O’Clock, for the benefit of the Milton Lyceum during the coming winter, and that I would give them an address on that occasion.— This Lecture and address hunting is becoming annoying, and makes me feel ridiculous— I excused myself to the Ladies as well as I could, but I could scarcely refrain from laughter, on saying no, to four women asking me to address them— I received this morning by the mail a proof sheet of the Atlas, containing the first part of my address to my constituents at Weymouth on the 17th. of last month— It makes six columns of the paper and yet contains not half the speech, dilated as it is in writing it out. It took me three hours to deliver it, and what I have written and shall write will take more than three hours to read— The part now printed reads to me excessively dull and very clumsily put together— The second part will be more methodical, and perhaps for that reason more dull— I see there is on it a great want of point. The more I speak the more I feel my deficiency in the art of speaking, and the want of the faculty of compression.— I revised the proof, and took it to the Post Office directed to the Editors of the Atlas. At the same I called at the Bank, and deposited a check for 200 dollars, on the Merchants Bank Boston received 3 days since from my Son; and I drew 100 dollars of it in small bills of this Bank. Mr Lunt came to invite me to go with him next Wednesday to the ordination of Mr Huntington at the Church at South Boston were Mellish Motte has been the Minister, but some time since resigned— I said I was engaged to deliver a Lecture at the Lyceum here next Wednesday Evening; but would readily go to the ordination at Boston if the Lyceum here will postpone the Lecture till the week after next— Mr Lunt took tea with us— The Ladies and Walter went to the episcopal church and Charles spent the evening with me.

I laboured like a Slave all day upon my task of writing out, with enlargement my speech on the reception day at Braintree— But towards evening Mr George Tyler Bigelow, Mr Fearing, and two other members of the Boston whig Association came out to urge me once more to deliver to them a political address before the close of this month— Webster’s speech at Faneuil Hall has dislocated all the joints of the whig party, and they are in great fear that it will deliver over the State to Marcus Morton and the mongrel democracy— Cushing has been stumping at Newbury-Port, Haverhill and Lowell for the same purpose— These gentlemen believe that my counteracting influence would save the State, but they are entirely mistaken— I had a letter yesterday from Joseph E. Sprague, of Salem, to the same effect—but electioneering speeches now would pass for stumping to carry my own election— I have always abstained from it, and must still abstain— I told them that without wishing to interfere in any of the State elections I was entirely satisfied with the nomination of John Davis, both for re-election as Governor, and for the Office of Vice President, and that as to National Politics, my speech at Braintree would be published in the Atlas next week, and would give the whigs all the assistance which I believed it in my power to afford. I mentioned to them my engagement to defend Dutee J. Pearce upon his trial for Treason; and contradicted the paragraph in the morning post, asserting that I had given it as my opinion that Thomas W. Dorr, was now the lawful Governor of Rhode-Island— Isaac H Adams and his Sister Elizabeth were here this Evening— He sung and played. "

Heard Mr Lunt this morning from Ecclesiastes 1.18— He had read the whole chapter, and then the two verses which conclude the Book. ch. 12. V. 13. “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. 14. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”— The 18th verse of the first chapter is “For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.” The latter part of the verse only was the text. A difficult theme to handle for it seems to discourage the pursuit of knowledge— There are adverse doctrines on that subject in the old Testament— The fruit of the forbidden tree in Paradise was knowledge—The knowledge of good and evil— The supreme good of the Grecian Philosophers— The Song, the Proverbs, and the Book of Ecclesiastes, present in striking contrast and relief, three stages of the life of Solomon— It was impossible for Solomon to have written the Ecclesiastes in his youth or the Song in his old age— The song is the effusion of love and joy— The Proverbs are the fruits of long observation and experience in the ways of men—Shakespears Justice, full of fat capon, wise saws and modern instances. The Ecclesiastes is the lean and slipper’d pantaloon; verging already to the last stage of all.— In the Proverbs, the instruction to his son is get Wisdom—get understanding— The ways of Wisdom are ways of Pleasantness, and all her paths are peace— In the Ecclesiastes—[“]In much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth Sorrow”—how is all this to be reconciled? Is it all inspiration? Might not a very anxious parallel be drawn between the lives and history of Solomon and of Louis Quatorze— The same supernatural promise in Youth—the same consummate prosperity—the same weariness of life and uxorious idolatry in old age— To Solomon all was Vanity— Madame de Maintenon found it insupportable Slavery to entertain a man who was no longer amusable. Mr Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from 1. Corinthians 10.31. [“]Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” Before dismissing the congregation, he x read the Letter of invitation from the South Church at Boston to the Church at Quincy (x requested the members of the Church to remain) after the blessing, and then) to attend at the ordination of Mr Frederic T. Huntington next Wednesday Evening. he then nominated me to go with him as a delegate, for which the members silently raised their hands and it was thus ordained. I was up writing till Midnight. "

A man by the name of Booth, from Boston, introduced by Mr Burrell of this town, came with a subscription paper for building a methodist episcopal church in Boston— I declined, observing that I thought in so opulent a city as Boston, the people should pay for building and maintaining their own churches— He said these people were very poor. I replied that might be a good reason for them not to undertake the building of a church.— There were already more churches than there were worshipers to fill them; and the tendency of every new church built was to withdraw from other churches of the same denomination. he admitted that this was sometimes the case in villages; but he was sorely disappointed at my declining to suscribe— Mr Brigham called this afternoon, for my definitive answer to the invitation to address the whigs of the County of Norfolk, in the course of this month at Dedham. I told Mr Brigham that I must definitively decline: and I believe I convinced Mr Brigham, that it would be better for the whig party as well as for myself that I should abstain from attendance at any of these public meetings at this time— Towards sunset, finding myself falling asleep over my paper while writing I was walking up the hill, when Mr Joseph Grinnell of New-Bedford, overtook me in a Chaise and delivered to me a Letter signed by 17. very respectable citizens of that town, earnestly intreating me to attend the great whig meeting at Taunton next Wednesday; and I had received a very kind and warm invitation from Mr John Marston of that town to his house. I repeated to Mr Grinnell all the reasons which I had given to Mr Brigham and to the Committee from Boston, for declining to attend there public meetings; and added that I was now under an engagement for Wednesday—which would render my attendance at Taunton impossible— He wished me to answer the Letter from the 17 gentlemen of New Bedford, so that my answer could be read at the meeting; but that would be difficult, and I believe inexpedient— The first part of my Braintree reception speech was published in the Boston Atlas of this morning, and they sent me 6 copies of the paper containing it. I took one of them to the Office of the Quincy Patriot, requesting of the Pressmen that it might be republished in the Patriot next Saturday. Mr Green was absent at Boston— "

The pressure upon my brain is so severe, that I am not without concern for the preservation of my reason. And I see no end yet to the Braintree speech— Mr Charles E Loud, a son of Samuel P. Loud of Dorchester, brought me a Letter from his father repeating the invitation to me to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum at Dorchester. I agreed so to do, this day week, at 7. O’Clock in the evening. They are to send a carriage for me to take me there and to bring me home after the Lecture— This rage for lecturing and for political addresses, I fear will break me down. Yesterday at the United States Hotel, Deacon Greely introduced to me, Mr Lee of Barré, and afterwards Mr. Jenkins of the same place, charged with a special mission to invite me to go there and deliver an Address or a Lecture, I forget which. I declined either— This afternoon Mr Ralph B. Forbes of Milton, and his wife paid us a visit— His brother John Forbes lives in Boston. They are both sons of Ralph B. Forbes, whom I knew as a boy at Cambridge, younger brother of my classmate John Forbes. Ralph the father of these two young men was great part of his Life a cripple with the gout, and very indigent, supported chiefly by his brother John— But their mother is a Sister of Coll. Thomas H. Perkins; and through that connection these young men went out as adventurers to China, and have returned home laden with wealth. Their father and uncle John are both dead. The latter with my Commission as chargé d’Affaires at Buenos-Ayres. Mr Forbes enquired if I should deliver my promised Lecture upon the English and Chinese War— I shall certainly not have time to write it— He was also very anxious to know if there would be an impost duty upon tea laid at the approaching Session of Congress— I could not tell; but had some misgivings that there would— John A. Green the publisher of the Quincy Patriot sent me the second proof half sheet of my Temperance Lecture. It was sadly misprinted, but I revised it, till it was tolerably correct. It is the poorest thing I ever wrote; and I believe I should have done better by refusing the copy for publication.— But this might have seemed like flinching from the examination of my own principles. Ruth Turner, Seamstress was here, as Miss Sarah Sampson has been two days of this week. I received a Letter from Joseph L. Tillinghast of Providence, which I immediately answered. "

I am nailed down to my writing table, to the suspension almost total of my customary exercise which with the pressure on my brain has brought on a bleeding at the nose— From my rising this day with exception of two half hours for breakfasting and dining I was twelve hours at work, writing. Mr Bartlett came with a Bill from Mr Parnell announcing that he would lecture at 7. O’Clock this Evening at the Hancock house on Phreno-Magnetism, or Neurology and said Mr Parnell was very desirous of my attendance at the Lecture, and I promised to go— I received a note from Mr Charles Sumner, telling me that judge William Jay of Bedford, New-York would come out with his two daughters to visit me this afternoon, with him, and they accordingly came and took tea with us— The judge is the youngest of the two sons of John Jay, and was born in New-York, after his return from France in 1784. He spoke to me of Jared Sparks’s false Statements, denying the duplicity of the French Government in the Negotiation for Peace of 1782. and of his disingenuousness in suppressing the intercepted Letter of Marbois; in the compilation of the Revolutionary diplomatic correspondence entrusted to him by Mr Clay.— It is difficult to ascribe to mere infatuation the engouement of Sparks for Franklin— It is that sort of fanaticism which sweeps away all a man’s honesty— Mr Jay said that Lord St. Helens, to whom a copy of his life of his father had been sent, had made some marginal notes on it, and among the rest, one, declaring it true, that in that Negotiation, Vergennes, had proposed to the British Government to deprive the people of this Union of their share of the Newfoundland fishery. Mr George Brown of Beverley came in almost at the same time with Mr Jay, and his family. Mr Brown came as a deputy from the Lyceum with a Resolution he said of bringing me with him bodily. I told him I would go to Beverley if possible; and would let him know when, as soon as possible— At 7. in the Evening I went with Walter Hellen to the Hancock house and heard the lecture of Mr Parnell who said he had known me formerly, but I did not remember him— His Lecture, after a short essay upon the four temperaments—the Nervous, the sangwine, this lymphatic, magnetised a young man, with the aid of another by waving their hands over his head, and by touching his head with a magnetic tractor—laid him asleep, and made him practice many contortions in that condition—I thought it a mere farce.

Morning visit from William and Samuel Lawrence the latter of whom presented to me, a copy of a Resolution adopted at a meeting of the whigs of Lowell last Saturday Evening, in the highest degree complimentary to me with a very earnest invitation to me that I would deliver an address to the whigs of that city previous to the approaching election— A second Resolution that Samuel Lawrence Esqr be a Committee to present to me that invitation; and a third that a copy of it be forwarded to me— I answered as I have fortunately done to all the applications for political addresses to be delivered with reference to the elections; expressing my gratitude for the honour done me by the invitation; but that I had declined and must decline all invitations to deliver addresses to political meetings— But I said I had received an invitation to deliver a lecture before the lyceum at Lowell, which I had not answered— I would engage to go some day the week after next and deliver that lecture, which Mr Samuel Lawrence said would answer just as well as an address; for what the people of Lowell wanted was to see and hear me; and so it is with all these importunate invitations— It is the same curiosity under the spur of which the flock and pay to see the Ourang Outang, the Mermaid the Anaconda, or the Rhinoceros.— Soon after these Gentlemen went away two persons announcing themselves as Baptist clergymen from New Hampshire, brothers by the name of Richardson, perhaps from Templeton came to see and converse with me— I did converse with them freely for about an hour—one of them, apparently the younger was wholly silent—the other, cheerful and talkative, and both very well bred— Mr Green brought me the third and last half sheet of my Lecture on Temperance, which I revised and returned to him. It is advertised in this morning’s Quincy Patriot, for sale at that Office next Tuesday: but under cover of this invitation from the Norfolk County Society for the suppression of intemperance, I have some reason to believe that the members of the Committee from this town, who have been very busy in this matter, are actuated by no friendly feeling for me— Walter Hellen went to Boston this morning to spend the Sunday with Mr Moody; and I sent by him a note to Mr Saml H. Walley junr, offering to lecture at Roxbury next Tuesday or Friday. Half an hour before Sunset I rambled over the hill, and gathered apples and pears. On coming home I found Harriet Welsh here. "

[“]These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so.”— This is the remarkable chapter, closing with the discourse of Paul at Athens, but he had before passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Thessalonica and Berea and it is of the inhabitants of this last city, that the testimony is borne of their superior nobility, or as Mr Lunt expounded it, ingenuousness to that of the Thessalonians. The Scriptures which at that time they searched must have been the Books of the Old Testament— The Law and the prophets— To the jews Paul preached Jesus Christ, as the Messiah foretold in the Scriptures—and the Bereans daily searched the scriptures whether those things were so, but when he came to Athens the Jewish Scriptures were of no Avail. There he had to deal with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers, whose enquiry was what will this babbler say? To them he came to explain who that unknown God was to whom they had built an altar. And with what power he opened to them the character of the true God, the creator of all worlds.— I often think what Cicero would have said if he been one of Paul’s auditory upon Mars hill—he who speculated so profoundly upon the Nature of the Gods—what light would have flashed upon his mind, if the idea had been presented to it of one God—creator of the worlds—creator of one man and one woman from whom were descended the whole human race—all of one blood; therefore all equal. If Paul had told him that the philosophical enquiry of man, was not selfish enjoyment the supreme good—but the depravity of his own nature—repentance, and judgment after death— This would be a good subject for a lecture—a dialogue between Cicero and St. Paul— Let me think of it—Cicero de Natura Deorum, and Paul at Athens— Mr Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from 1. Corinthians 15.46 “How be it, that was not first, which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.”— By the natural body is meant the material body, which it seems to say was created before the spiritual body— The great argument for the resurrection of the body is in truth an argument for the immortality of the soul— It rests entire inference from the resurrection of Christ— I went up the hill to observe the setting Sun but he was sinking behind a camel’s back mound. George T. Bigelow and Charles Miller came in while I was there— Charles, with his wife and Harriet Welsh were here. "

They returned before dinner and Walter Hellen came back with them. By a final, and strenuous exertion, I closed the writing out of my reception Speech at Braintree on the 17th. of September—about 85 pages in all— With the Lecture on Temperance it makes 100 pages written since my arrival from Washington, which with the daily record of this diary make an average of 3 close written pages a day— My powers would not bear a severe stretching— Just before dinner, five very respectably looking men of colour, three Negroes and two light mulattos, came as a delegation from a meeting of the People of colour in Boston, at which they told me, upwards of 500 persons were present, to solicit me, to act as council in behalf of George Latimer, arrested and claimed as a slave, by James B. Gray of Norfolk, Virginia— They delivered to me, a Letter from S. E. Sewall, and Amos Binney Merrill, lawyers of Boston engaged as counsel for Latimer, recommending to me them and the object of their mission. I answered them, expressing my grateful sensibility to the coloured people of Boston, for this mark of their confidence in me, and said I would cheerfully comply with their invitation if I were still in the practice of the Law—but that for more than 30 years, I had been withdrawn from it by othe occupations, and except in one instance about 2 years ago, when I argued before the Supreme Court of the United States the Cause of the captive Africans of the Amistad, I had never resumed the practice— I had now one contingent engagement to defend Mr Dutee J. Pearce upon an Indictment against him for Treason, but I hoped he would not be tried at all— This too was a very extraordinary occasion, and upo no other should I feel myself justified in attempting to address a Court and Jury— But they might say to Mr Sewall, and Mr Merrill that if any point of Law should occur upon which they might think that my opinion could be of and service to their client I would cheerfully give it at their request— They asked me to write a word of answer to Messrs. Sewall and Merrill, which I promised to do and did. Deacon Spear was here this afternoon—Harriet Welsh, in the Evening, and Ruth Turner all day—Mrs. C. F. Adams, having been to Boston this morning did not come. "

O’Clock near 4 hours I was revising the manuscript of the second part of my reception Speech at Braintree; and I sent it by my Son to the Editors of the Atlas at Boston— Mr Nathaniel Cross of Portland, brought me a Letter of introduction from William Pitt Fessenden, the member of Congress— Mr Cross was a merchant residing at Matanzas in the years 1839. 40 and 41. and was appointed by two successive Consuls their official agent during the times of their absence—and after the death of Mr Shoemaker, the first, and after the return home of Mr Courts, the second, He acted as Vice-Consul, considered himself as such, and Mr Forsyth then Secretary acknowledged the receipt of his communications in performance of the consular functions— Last year at the complaint of two woman of bad character he was arrested by the municipal authorities of Matanzas, kept in prison 147 days, and then released without a trial. The charge against him was of having taken possession of the property of a woman of this country who died in the house, with the two complainants. He had not taken possession of one Article of the property but only took an inventory of her effects after her decease. The complaint was made a year afterwards, and was utterly groundless— Mr Cross supposed the Government of the United States bound to obtain from the Spanish Government redress and indemnity for him, as Vice Consul of the United States as Vice Consul; but Mr Webster had told him 1. that neither of the two Consuls, was authorised to appoint a Vice Consul and 2. That Consuls had no privilege of exemption from arrest, imprisonment or trial, by the Laws of the Country where they exercised their functions— But that representations in his behalf should be made to the Spanish Government. Mr Cross was here twice and asked my advice whether he should petition Congress. I told him if he wished it, I would present his petition, but that they would refer it to the Secretary of State, whose answers to him had been all correct, and this Government could not hold itself responsible for the wrongs he had suffered at Matanzas. I advised him to see Mr Webster again. Mr Randall came to enquire again if there was a vacancy for his ministration at cedar grove I told him I had heard they were for the present supplied— Mr Swan is a traveling book pedlar, and I subscribed for his Book of the United States.— I had promised to deliver a Lecture this evening at Roxbury; but a storm of rain came on this afternoon which continued all the evening and prevented me from going— I was up writing till 11. p.m. "

Mr Durfee is the Minister of a Congregational Church at South Dedham: he married a daughter of Dr John Pierce of Brookline, and came with two children a boy and a girl to see me, and to ask for autographs of my father and mother, which I promised to procure for him— I wrote a note of apology to Mr Walley for having failed to go to Roxbury, according to appointment last Evening, and proposing to go there next Friday. Mr Quincy the President of the University and his son Josiah were here together, and the Coll. invited me to dine with him next Saturday week at 5. O’Clock p.m. I had received a Letter from Mr Tillinghast of Providence, requesting my permission to publish my Letter to him of the 20th. which I answered immediately; consenting to the publication— Coll. Quincy took these two Letters promising to send the first to Mr Walley, and to put the other into the Post-Office at Boston. I had also a Letter from William B. Reed of Philadelphia requesting a copy or duplicate of my Letter to him of 19. Septr. which says was mislaid. or has been purloined from him. Mary-Louisa made a copy of it, from my Letter book, which I signed and took to the Post-Office— As I was on my return home I was met by an express from Mr Walley, with a note apprizing me of the disappointment of a full hall by my failure to appear last evening, and urging me to come on Friday.— I told the express to say that I would come and that Mr Walley would receive my note, containing that assurance before the express would reach him— Mr Crosby an Agent of the American temperance Union came to solicit of me a subscription to their funds which I declined, on his informing me that they required the pledge of total abstinence from the use of all spirituous liquors. I told him I thought the requiring of the pledge of total abstinence was an error, to which I would give no countenance; and my address was composed altogether on that principle. He argued the question with me, perseveringly, but in good humour and without producing conviction or subscription.— Mr and Mrs John Angier were here from Medford—I delivered the introductory Lecture, before the Quincy Lyceum at the town hall—On Democracy— The Constitution and Bylaws were read— Then my Lecture— Then a pleasing poem by Henry S. Washburn— My eyes were so much affected that I had great difficulty in getting through. The hall not quite full. Charles and Walter Hellen went with me— It was near 10.

My first visitor this morning was Mr Southwick a young man about 25. who came from Mendon to see me, and the houses in which my father and I were born, and the house in which I live, and its furniture and pictures, and everything about it— He sat with me upwards of an hour, almost the whole time silent, asking about once in five minutes some question about my father or myself—answering very briefly what questions I asked of him—seeming afraid to say what brought him here, and yet sitting like a fixture to the house, while I was in torture wishing him to go away without daring to hint to him that my time was my treasure. At last he enquired if I had any spare copies of any of my published writings to sell— I said no, but had some that I would give him and I did give him an Eulogy on James Monroe, a Jubilee of the Constitution, a Texas Speech of 1838—A speech on the Navy pension fund—on the case of M’Leod, and a Tariff veto report. He very earnestly urged me to allow me to pay for them which I declined— He was scarcely gone when Dr Brewer one of the Editors of the Atlas came in with Thurlow Weed Editor of the Evening journal at Albany came deputed by the whig association there to intreat me to go there and address the whigs upon public affairs— He said it was their only chance to save the State— I well knew that my going there and addressing the whigs would not have the weight of a straw to save the State; and it was equally clear that the State cannot be saved— I satisfied Mr Mead who brought me a recommendatory Letter from Governor William H. Seward that I could not go to preach Politics at Albany, and that if I should it would be of no avail— Dr Brewer gave me a small parcel of copies of the Atlas of the 17. and 28. October containing the two parts of my reception speech; and he took the first half sheet of the pamphlet revised, for Mr Eastburn— I had received it this morning and received the second half sheet this Evening— At noon we had a meeting of the Supervisors of the Temple and School fund, and chose my Son, to be one of the board in the place of Edward Miller deceased— Transacted the little other business there was to be done, and the members dined with me together with the Ministers Whitney Lunt and Robinson— William Johnson of Utica, and Mrs Charles F. Adams After dinner Mr Leavitt and Mr Chamberlain were here, wishing me to attend the meeting at Faneuil Hall to-morrow evening which I declined— Mr Joseph H.

Doctor Flint of Salem preached this morning from Matthew 5.48. “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” This command of Jesus Christ; to his disciples, in his sermon on the mount to be perfect, as God is perfect, is perhaps the strongest exemplification of the specific character of the Christian dispensation to be found in the New Testament. The essence of the doctrine of regeneration is that a man must purify himself into another being and assume a new nature— That he must extirpate from his own bosom all the selfish passions, and be born again to become a new man— Whether that doctrine applies to persons born and bred under the Christian dispensation, or was intended only for the Jews and Gentiles of his own times may admit of question— The Jew, born under the Law. the Heathen bred under the Grecian Mythology, could become Christians only by conversion. And it was in answer to the enquiries of Nicodemus, a Pharisee, ruler of the Jews that Jesus revealed the doctrine of regeneration— All the precepts of Christianity are commands to aim at perfection— The injunctions to love our neighbours as ourselves, and to do unto others as we would that they should do unto us, are calls to perfection, and this peremptory order to be as perfect as God, is the same thing in other words—change your natures—strip yourselves of all your evil propensities—become new men—be born again—be perfect, as God is perfect— Dr Flint’s discourse terminated, somewhat strangely by a laudatory panegyric upon Charles Dickens’s novel, published by the name of Boz. The Doctor dined with us, together with Bishop Griswold, who preached at the Episcopal Church. My wife and granddaughter Mary-Louisa, attended there, morning and afternoon— The Bishop, baptized one child and administered the rite of confirmation to about 20 persons. Dr Flint’s afternoon sermon was from 1. Peter 4.7. “But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.” A man by the name of Miller, has been starting a religious panic in this neighbourhood by the prediction that the end of the world is coming in the year 1843.— He has attracted numerous followers, and formed a sect, who are now holding a camp meeting in the neighbourhood of Salem— There are said to be numbers of them in this town of Quincy. Dr Flint’s address was to reason them into their Senses. Mr Loring of Hingham was at our church this afternoon, and came afterwards to propose that I should deliver my Lecture at Hingham, next Tuesday at half past 3. in the afternoon, instead of 7. in the Evening, to which I agreed. Mrs John Adams is quite unwell. confined almost the whole day to her chamber— Walter Hellen went last evening, with W. Johnson, to Boston. "

Yet there was a white frost on the ground indicating that the rise in the thermometer above the freezing point had taken place since midnight— It continued to rise till Sunset when it was about 50— My Son took Mary-Louisa, and Louisa Catherine with him into Boston to pass three days at Mrs Frothingham’s—and He with his family are to remove into Boston for the winter on Thursday—and Mary-Louisa, is to remain with them till Saturday. I received by the mail this morning proof half sheets 4 and 5. of my reception speech—revised the 4th. and sent it back by my son—then the 5th. which on my way to Hingham I stop’d and left at the Post-Office. We dined at one, and just as we were departing Andrew T. Judson, judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Connecticut, came to pay me a visit. He was a member of the 24th Congress, and with me of the Committee of manufactures. In 1836. during the 1st. Session of that Congress he was appointed by President Jackson Judge of the District Court of Connecticut and has held that office ever since. His firmness in the case of the Amistad Africans, though his opinion was not altogether consistent with itself probably saved their lives and their Liberty. I regretted very much that he came just at the moment when I was obliged to go, and could not even suspend my departure half an hour. Walter Hellen went with me, and we alighted at Mr Loring’s house just at 3. He was married the week before last, to a miss Fudger of Dorchester, and his house in bridal trim— The time for the lecture had been fixed at half past three. Mr Joseph Richardson the Minister of the parish, walked with us to the old meeting house, and introduced me to his pulpit— It was a quarter before 4 when I commenced, and after reading an hour I found the light fading so that I could no longer follow my manuscript— As the darkness increased I skip’d over paragraphs and then whole pages, without waiting to discriminate, but dashing through, and not seeming to be embarrassed— I barely made out to read the last two paragraphs, and came off as well, as if I had read the whole. We then returned to Mr Loring’s— He had invited a party to tea of about 30 ladies and gentlemen our relatives and friends— It was a conversation, which I should have been glad to protract, had not too much of it been assigned to me— Mr Richardson and others asked successively several questions apparently for the express purpose of making me talk; and I was perhaps not altogether wise in suffering myself thus to get drawn out— I took an early opportunity to get out— We left the company at 7. and reached home shortly before 8. Found Mrs Charles at our house, and he soon after came in. She was unwell, just before they left us to go home. "

                "text": "1. V. Tuesday. Sun rose 6.33—invisible. White frost— Fahrenheit 36.  My Thermometer at Sun-rise was 10 degrees higher than it has been for several preceding days. Yet there was a white frost on the ground indicating that the rise in the thermometer above the freezing point had taken place since midnight— It continued to rise till Sunset when it was about 50— My Son took Mary-Louisa, and Louisa Catherine with him into Boston to pass three days at Mrs Frothingham’s—and He with his family are to remove into Boston for the winter on Thursday—and Mary-Louisa, is to remain with them till Saturday. I received by the mail this morning proof half sheets 4 and 5. of my reception speech—revised the 4th. and sent it back by my son—then the 5th. which on my way to Hingham I stop’d and left at the Post-Office. We dined at one, and just as we were departing Andrew T. Judson, judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Connecticut, came to pay me a visit. He was a member of the 24th Congress, and with me of the Committee of manufactures. In 1836. during the 1st. Session of that Congress he was appointed by President Jackson Judge of the District Court of Connecticut and has held that office ever since. His firmness in the case of the Amistad Africans, though his opinion was not altogether consistent with itself probably saved their lives and their Liberty. I regretted very much that he came just at the moment when I was obliged to go, and could not even suspend my departure half an hour. Walter Hellen went with me, and we alighted at Mr Loring’s house just at 3. He was married the week before last, to a miss Fudger of Dorchester, and his house in bridal trim— The time for the lecture had been fixed at half past three. Mr Joseph Richardson the Minister of the parish, walked with us to the old meeting house, and introduced me to his pulpit— It was a quarter before 4 when I commenced, and after reading an hour I found the light fading so that I could no longer follow my manuscript— As the darkness increased I skip’d over paragraphs and then whole pages, without waiting to discriminate, but dashing through, and not seeming to be embarrassed— I barely made out to read the last two paragraphs, and came off as well, as if I had read the whole. We then returned to Mr Loring’s— He had invited a party to tea of about 30 ladies and gentlemen our relatives and friends— It was a conversation, which I should have been glad to protract, had not too much of it been assigned to me— Mr Richardson and others asked successively several questions apparently for the express purpose of making me talk; and I was perhaps not altogether wise in suffering myself thus to get drawn out— I took an early opportunity to get out— We left the company at 7. and reached home shortly before 8. Found Mrs Charles at our house, and he soon after came in. She was unwell, just before they left us to go home. "

There was a threatening of foul weather this morning and thick clouds over the Sun till near noon when they dispersed, and a clear sky and chilly atmosphere followed— I received the 6th. proof half sheet of my reception speech, by the mail; revised it, and took it to the Post-Office, with answers to invitation Letters received also this morning from L Saltonstall, and Nathl Silsbee of Salem, and George Brown of Beverly— I had a visit from F.

He was accompanied by a friend from Boston, whose name he mentioned but articulated so indistinctly that I could not retain it. Mrs Lunt with her aunt Miss Pearson visited here but I did not see them. She said Mr Lunt was going this Evening to Milton to hear my Lecture— At half past five I went first to Mr Lunt’s house to take him up, but he was not there, or no one heard my knocking at the door, so that I went to Milton alone. I found easily Mr Joseph Angier’s house— He was at tea, with his wife, and two chubby boys of 2 and 4 years old. Mrs. Angier is a beautiful woman whom he married while he was minister at New Bedford— At a quarter past 7. they both went with me to the Lyceum hall, about a mile distant, and I delivered my Lecture on Society and civilization with some omissions which abridged it within a compass of an hour— The hall was crowded—the attention of the audience unremitted and the delivery unobstructed, as I took the precaution to have two additional lamps brought in and placed at the sides of the desk before which I stood. After the lecture, Mr John Forbes came and spoke to me, and enquired if I should deliver another Lecture upon China which I told him I should not; having no time to prepare one. I returned with Mr and Mrs Angier to his house, where Mr Forbes his next door neighbour sent me an Evening Newspaper containing the news received by the Steamerwhich arrived this morning from Liverpool, whence she sailed on the 19th of last Month. The average passage of these Steamers during the Summer months is now fourteen days— The only news of importance, received by the Steamer is the ratification in England of the Ashburton Treaty; after much more severe censure upon it in the English newspapers, than it has had to encounter here— I reached home just at 10. O’Clock, and Elizabeth C. Adams immediately after, went home— Charles and his wife had gone just before— I got thus through the day much better than I had feared this morning when for upwards of an hour sharp pains in my left eye threatened me with an inflammation, and my hoarseness with a failure of my voice.

My Son removed this day with his family to his house N. 57.

I took a small chest with me from home for a change of linen and writing materials and carelessly put into it my small inkstand enclosed in a tin box— Last Night on opening the chest to take out my night cap and flannel night gown I found that every drop of ink had oozed out of the little wedgewood stand, through the tin box, and stained through the right shoulder of one of my shirts— Some small portion of it had also blackened the edges of a sheet of writing paper, and had done no other damage— Not a drop of ink was left in the stand; and I was obliged to give up my intention of writing before breakfast— Immediately after that Mr Saltonstall went with me to a barber’s shop, where I was shaved and had my hair cut— Mr Stephen C. Phillips soon came, and we visited the public schools. The Classical school, for teaching Greek and Latin. The English high school. The common schools for boys and girls from 4 to 16. years of age— Mr Phillips was 3 years Mayor of Salem and gave his whole Salary to the city at the end of the term for the improvement of the schools. We heard the boys recite in Greek. Mr Phillips gave me a Salem Register of 11. July last containing a description of the manner in which these two schools the grammar and high schools are constructed, fitted up, and furnished— It is curious in the highest degree, but I have neither time nor space to describe it— Mr Horace the Secretary of the School commissioners of the Commonwealth, by annual reports, and addresses, and by the monthly publication of a common school Journal, has spur’d on the zeal for the improvement of schools with great effect; and Mr Philips has caught the inspiration, and is labouring with great perseverance to carry into practical execution Mr Mann’s projected improvements. There are now 2500 children, at the public schools here in a population of 15000— Among the studies here introduced is that of singing chorus, and by the notes, pinn’d up on the side of the wall— This visitation took us three hours— Returning to Mr Saltonstall’s house we met at the door an old man, who asked me, if I remembered his face— I did not— It was Nathan Poland first mate of the ship Horace Captain Benjamin Beckford, with whom in August 1809. I went to Russia— I asked him if he would have known me again he said no— Mr Saltonstall asked him into his house, and he sat with me an hour and enquired about every individual who was with me on that voyage; and telling many incidents which occurred on the voyage. Mr Saltonstall had invited a small party to dinner, among whom were my old Classmate Samuel Putnam, and Nathaniel Silsbee— At half past 3. Mr George Brown came and went to Beverly— A stream of company came till seven, where I delivered the Lecture, and returned with Mr Saltonstall to Salem. Music by his daughter and Miss Austin "

Mr Lunt preached this morning from James 1.13. “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. 14. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed.” The cares of this world so absorb and agitate my Soul that although Mr Lunt’s discourse was ingenious and eloquent as usual, it left no impression upon my memory, and was like water poured upon a cullender. Mr Degrand came out from Boston, and dined and spent the day with us.— Mr Lunt’s afternoon discourse was from Acts 8.3. “As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women, committed them to prison.” And still the world was uppermost in my thoughts. The history and character of St. Paul duly studied affords, an inexhaustible them for commentary, elucidation and instruction for a preacher of the gospel— Human invention could not imagine such a man, still less could it combine together such a series of events, and compose for such a history such discourses and epistles. Paley’s Horae Paulinae, might be drawn out upon a much more comprehensive plan— Mr Lunt did not enlarge upon the personal character, genius, temper or adventures of Paul— In expatiating on this testimonial to the violence of his zeal, passions and prejudices before his conversion, he confined himself chiefly to reflections on the unaccountable infatuation of the spirit which can inflame itself into hatred of such doctrines as compose the fundamental parts of the Christian Religion— The being and attributes of God— The immortality of the Soul— The law of mutual love and universal benevolence— A bigot of atheism! There is no basement story to that edifice— If true, its conclusions are cruelty, treachery, and despair.— Degrand left us about 7. O’Clock and returned to Boston— I wrote and sent by him a Letter to Dr. Wilde of Brookline, offering to go there on Tuesday or Friday next as will best suit them to the Lecture-delivery before the Lyceum; and requesting that they would send a Carriage to my house to take me there and home— My conversations yesterday with Leavitt and Stanton, and afterwards with Abbott Lawrence have aggravated the pressure on my mind and spirits almost beyond endurance. At the very closing stage of life, I have staked my good name and character upon an issue the result of which depends on a Providence dubious in its designs and inscrutable in its ways of bringing good out of evil— I can have no reliance but upon myself on Earth and upon God in Heaven— My barque is on the wave, and the polar star is in the sky.

On their way to Boston, they called to see me for more curiosity sake., professing much respect for my character—of the sincerity of which I have no reason to doubt— Mr Tileston of Dorchester, and Mr Thompson of Milton came to request that I would deliver a Lecture some day this or the next week before the Dorchester and Milton Lyceum, at the Milton Village. My time is becoming so short, and I have so many other engagements on hand that I could not positively engage, but promised to come, if I could possibly find the time, and to let them know next Saturday— Mr Harrison Gray Otis, and his daughter Mrs Ritchie paid us a morning visit—he is about two years my senior—crippled with the gout; and scarcely able to hobble along; but still cheerful, witty, loving laughter and a flatterer— I finally made out to take the 14th. quarto volume of my diary, to Mr Gill the book-binder to be bound. But I have not been able to assort about 50 volumes of loose pamphlets which incumber my rooms.— I added to the volume sundry fragments, for I have found it impossible to keep my diary unbroken— Since 1. June 1839. there is no chasm; a page a day and rarely two pages have been my continual task; but the keeping of a diary that I would recommend would be Quarto volumes of one size of 500 pages each—every page divided by two red lines into 3 equal parts— The entries to be made in abridged style and form of memoranda—never to exceed or fall short of one third of a page— Each volume to contain the record of 4. years— In 60 years this would make 15 volumes of 500 pages each—quite enough for the autobiography of one man.— I have already more volumes and multitudes of fragments— Trash inexpressible which I pray to God may never be exposed; but which I leave to my Son to be used according to his good judgment for a memoir of my life; and if by the Mercy of God, the manuscripts should be preserved, to be left with those of my father to one of my grandsons who may be worthy of possessing and passing them down to future generations— Mr Harvey Field was here this afternoon, chaffering about the 6. Acre lot called the Quincy Meadow— Our evening family party much reduced by the removal of that of my Son into Boston employed much of the day in folding up, and of the Evening in directing parcels of my pamphlet Address with the veto report.

A North-east storm this day closed a continued spell of beautiful weather of six weeks duration— Clear days; cool nights with an average of Fahrenheit’s thermometer at 40 at Sunrise; Not more than 5 days have been crystal clear from the rising to the setting Sun— Rain has not fallen on more than 3 days of 45. and only once to continue 8 hours— Many Mornings a low cloud bordering the horizon from East to South has intercepted the sight of the Sun at his rising when the whole firmament beside was clear. I take these clouds to be exhalations raised by the Sun from the surface of the Sea, and that they always rise with an atmosphere from the freezing point to 50 of Fahrenheit.— The storm of this day has been preceded by four or five days of Indian Summer—Warm Sunny days—Nights with Fahrenheit from 30 to 50. the Sun rising invisible in thick haze, but appearing in deep crimson colour within five or ten minutes after rising.— At Sunrise this morning, the sky was overcast—the thermometer at 50—the wind S.E. almost calm, and the feeling of the air warm— It soon began to sprinkle, then to rain, and the wind veering to the East and North-east, and freshening till by 10. O’Clock it became a chilling Northeast storm: Dr Pierce of Brookline nevertheless came to inform me that Dr Wild had received my Letter, which Degrand took to Boston Sunday Evening, and that next Friday evening will suit them better for the delivery of the Lecture than this Evening—and I agreed with him that I will be at my Son’s house N. 57. Mount Vernon Street Boston next Friday at 4. p.m where they will have a Carriage ready to take me to Brookline, and to bring me home after the Lecture, which commences at 7. I asked Dr Pierce to stay and dine with us but he said he was engaged and went off in the midst of the storm— My Son came out from Boston with Walter Hellen; he dined with us, and returned after dinner to Boston. I was engaged all day in retrieving the arrears of last weeks diary; and in answering a Letter from Life Baldwin, corresponding Secretary of the Brighton Lyceum inviting me in behalf of the Directors of that Society to deliver a Lecture before them. This one of a multitude of such Letters which have remained nearly three weeks unanswered— I propose next Saturday or the Thursday after— This evening we were again all engaged in directing and franking copies of my pamphlet reception speech to one inhabitant of each town—of the 12th. present Congregational District, and of the 8th. District under the new apportionment, together with a copy of the report of the Tariff veto— The rest of the evening was occupied in reading Charles Dickins’s notes on America, republished in a New-York Newspaper from a copy received by the Great Western Steamer, just arrived.

                "text": "12. V. Saturday.  I return home, but not to repose— I could not wholly redeem the arrear of one day in this diary— Mr Tileston of Dorchester came this morning and I agreed with him to go next Tuesday evening to Mr Joseph Morton’s house on the Northern slope of Milton hill at 6. O’Clock; to proceed thence and deliver a lecture, before the united Dorchester and Milton Lyceum— I offered to go this evening; but he said they would be engaged in caucus meetings preparatory to the elections to be held next Monday, which is be the downfall of the whig party in this commonwealth— Charles and his wife came out from Boston, and dined with us, and returned home with rain. Isaac H. Adams also dined with us and Joseph H. Allen, the student at the Divinity school at Cambridge, Grandson of Professor Henry Ware senior, and son of the Revd. Joseph Allen of Northborough— The same who recently brought me a recommendatory Letter from Professor Convers Francis. Some days since he sent me his Album with a request that I would write some lines in it— I had not done it for mere want of time; but I now copied into it, a Sonnet upon the Morning Star— He had walked here from Cambridge this morning, and immediately after dinner he left us to walk in the midst of the rain without Great Coat or Umbrella to Boston— I received as usual a number of Letters, requesting me to deliver Lectures in sundry places, and among them one from Joseph L. Tillinghast of Providence Rhode-Island—requesting a copy of my Lecture upon Democracy for publication— This has occasioned no small embarrassment in my mind, for the topic is as sharp with quills as the fretful porcupine; and the same opinions, which have been very favourably received here may be very obnoxious there— I need a guiding Spirit as much as I ever did at any period of my life— My present position is one of great popularity with a falling party; and in falling with them the prospect for me is of a sudden, and overwhelming reverse in which case persecution may come not only upon myself which I can bear with fortitude, but upon those to whom my good name is not only dear but necessary for their comfort. I have deliberately assumed an aggressive position against the President, and his whole executive Administration—against the Supreme Court of the United States, and against the commander in chief of the army— I am at issue with all the organized powers, of the Union—with the twelve hundred millions of dollars of associated wealth, and with all the rabid democracy of the land. I do not mistake my position, nor disguise to myself its perils— But my cause is the cause of my Country, and of human liberty. It is the cause of Christian improvement—the fulfilment of the prophesies, that the day shall come when Slavery and War shall be banished from the face of the Earth. "

                "text": "13. IV:30 Sunday  Fog— Rain— Chilling— No Sun.  Mr Stearns of Hingham, preached this morning, from John 12.48. “He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.” From the tenour of this chapter it seems apparent that the resurrection of Lazarus from the dead was the immediate cause of the conspiracy of the pharisees, which terminated in the crucifixion— The impression made upon the minds of the people was so great that the pharisees saw their only chance to save their institutions was to put Jesus to death as an imposter and Lazarus as his accomplice— In the discourse of which the text forms a part he announces so obscurely as not to be understood by his disciples his own approaching death—speaks of it in a tone at once of dejection and of confidence; illustrates his condition by the analogy of vegetation to the growth of which the death of the seed is indispensable; and earnestly dwells upon the averment that he does and can do nothing of himself, but all as he is commanded by his father— The text is a calm self collected threat of the final judgment of God against those who rejected him. The struggle between the spreading belief in Christ, and the worldly and religious influences against it, are painted in glowing colours in the apostles’ narrative. The transactions occurred only three or four days before the crucifixion— I invited Mr Stearns to dine with us, but he was previously engaged by Mr Whitney. As I was returning home from Meeting I stop’d in at my sons house and took out the 3d. volume of Lowrie and Clark’s American State papers containing the Instructions, from the Secretary of State James Monroe to the American Commissioners for Peace dated 15. April 1813—I found them p. 697. Mr Stearns’s afternoon text was Luke 9.25. “For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?” This passage is with a various reading in Matthew 16.26. and Mark 8.35–36. The stress upon Mr Stearns’s discourse was, the wretchedness of an accusing conscience even in the midst of the highest worldly prosperity— The subject is susceptible of much impressive detail and was well managed by Mr Stearns; but in a manner very different from that of the young graduates from the Divinity school at Cambridge— I read last evening and this morning Dr William Ellery Channing’s last words and dying testimonial against Slavery. The address delivered at Lenox on the first of August last the 4th Anniversary day of the abolition of Slavery in the British West India Colonies. It is the most powerful and enthusiastic of all his writings, and if it could fall upon a soil worthy of the seed would yield an abundant harvest—at least an hundred fold— Mr Buffum gave me a copy of it last week at Lynn— Walter Hellen read to us this evening the chapter on Washington city of Dickins’s notes on America.

Doctor Duggan called on me with a paper signed by him and Noah Curtis, requesting Governor Davis to appoint John Adams Green publisher of the Quincy Patriot, a Justice of Peace— Green has been divorced from a first wife and some months since was married in my house to Elizabeth Kirk— He is of the democratic party and so are a majority of the voters in the town of Quincy—and Green is as impartial to the opposite or whig party as he dares to be— I signed the paper which Dr Duggan came again in the afternoon and took away. Dr Duggan is the member from Quincy, in the State Legislature— He was a member in 1839 and 1840.— Henry Wood supplanted him in 1841 and he again supplanted Wood for the present year. He found however that his party had resolved to drop him for the next year, and last evening he sent a Letter to the democratic Caucus, requesting not to be considered a candidate— When I was upon my trial last Winter, the Doctor offered in the Legislature a strong and warm Resolution in my favour— It was referred to a joint Committee of which Seth Sprague junr was chairman on the part of the Senate— The Committee never reported—Duggan says, truly, by dissuasion of Sprague— Saltonstall had written to somebody, that Preston of South-Carolina, was chairman in Congress of the Senate on the Massachusetts claim; and if the Resolution in my favour should be adopted by the Legislature, the claim would suffer for it— Such is political friendship— Webster was under the rose— I gave Dr Duggan 6 of my published pamphlets— Mr Charles Quinn is an Irish adventurer who has been living several years in Kentucky as a teacher of writing; has printed recommendations signed by R. M Johnson, J. J. Crittenden and James Clark. Says he was married to a daughter of the late judge Todd, and divorced from her, with mutual consent by the Legislature of Kentucky— He has now come to try his fortune as a writing master at Quincy, and visited me as a curiosity. Elihu Thayer for Phebe Thayer, Asa Pritchard for bounty Lands for the heirs of his brother killed in military service in 1814. Thomas J. Noyes for Mary Pike and William Ellis for William Barron, and the heirs of Relief Dunbar came to make enquiries, concerning claims before Congress or at the Land or pension office to which I must attend when there— I went to the town hall and deposited my vote for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, County Senators and town Representative— my name was on the same ticket as Representative for the 8th. Congressional District in the 28th. Congress— I struck it out. called on Mrs Morton, who told me of her grievances and her claims for Georgia Lands and French spoliations before 1800. Then at the Bank with a check— At Mr L. Brackett’s where I saw Mrs Morton’s papers E. Price Greenleaf here for German Books. My wife, Mrs John Adams and Walter Hellen went to Boston and Mary-Louisa came home with them— Rain— "

The Atlas and Courier Boston Newspapers did not come by this morning’s mail and until the afternoon we were left in doubt of the result of my own election and of all the rest— The papers came in the afternoon, the Atlas only contained the returns for all the towns in the 8th. Congressional district, excepting Roxbury and Brighton— In the 29 Towns the returns are of 5272 for me 4908 for Ezra Wilkinson of Dedham and 60 scattering, leaving me a majority of 304 votes which the returns from Brighton and Roxbury will increase to about 400— In Boston Robert C. Winthrop is elected for the remaining session of this Congress and for the next— The whig ticket for Senators of the County of Suffolk, and the Boston ticket of 35 members of the house of representatives with the name of my son Charles Francis Adams at its head is elected. All the other elections are excessively disjointed— The whigs overwhelmed and the democracy altogether in the ascendant— I went to the Bank and took out current money for my wifes journey to Washington—and to the Town-hall, where I voted for Lysander Richards as representative for the town in the State Legislature but the Revd. John Gregory was chosen—the minister of the Universalist church—a stranger in the town—a Democrat of very questionable morals, having as it is said at least two living wives. It is remarkable that four of the most envenomed towns against me, in the District against me, are Braintree, Randolph, Quincy, and Weymouth— Three of which are formed of my native town of Braintree, and the 4th. the native town of my mother— Mr Beale and Mr Minott Thayer came to take leave of us before our departure for Washington— Thayer is mortified and ashamed of the Braintrees; but the people are a wayward master— We dined at one, and at two, my wife, with Mrs John Adams, her daughter Mary-Louisa, and Walter Hellen, and our coachman Philip Taryhill went off, in Gillett’s stage, to take the cars at 4. for Stonington on their way to Washington. The Revd. Dr John Codman, and his son Captain Codman also paid me a take leave visit— Asa Pritchard’s call yesterday was not for bounty lands, but to purchase a lot of mine of about 1. acre up in the quarries— Between 5 and 6. Mr Tileston came with a carriage and took me to Mr Joseph Morton’s house at Milton, where we took tea after which at 7. we crossed the bridge and in the hall on the hill on the Dorchester side, I delivered the lecture on Democracy. And then in the Carriage Mr Tileston brought me home— The town bell rang 9. after I got back— It was 7. years last June since I had been at Mr Morton’s house after the funeral of John Bailey. Morton was then 72. but strong and active— He is now 79 and a wreck close upon the last stage of all— Yet he followed me to the lecture "

This was a day of comparative tranquility, but of intense occupation without progress— Trivial but not trifling occupation.  saith the English poet Young.— and I deem it the duty of every Christian Man when he betakes himself to his nightly pillow, in self examination to say—What good have I done this day? Ay—and what evil have I done, that may be repaired, and repented of? Nor should he rise from that pillow the next morning till after enquiry, what good can I do, and to whom this day? I have made this my rule for many years, with superadded prayer to the Lord of all the giver of every good gift—for light—for discernment—for guidance—for self controul for a grateful heart, to feel and acknowledge all his blessings; for humble resignation to his will, and submission to his chastisements— I believe myself sincere but the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wished I do not believe the total depravity of man, but I am deeply conscious of the frailty of my own nature— Jesus Christ went about doing good—I would do the same— The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak— And now, what has been the occupation of this day? Writing the journal of yesterday— A Letter to Joseph L. Tillinghast of Providence in answer to one from him asking a copy of my Letter upon democracy for publication. A letter to Thomas L Dunnell of Providence in answer to one from him inviting me to deliver a lecture before the Lyceum at that place.— A Letter to J. B. Mann of Natick, in answer to an invitation from him to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum of that town—copies of all which in my Letter book were made for me, by my maternal cousin Louisa C. Smith— My son came out from Boston, dined with us and soon after returned. In the general wreck of the whig party in this Commonwealth and throughout the Union, he and myself are left among the ruins, still to contend against the misrule of a triumphant fraudulent and reckless democracy— A severe trial awaits us both; and I trust will be the last of my political struggles upon earth— Never throughout my life have I stood more in need of the merciful and controuling hand of omnipotent goodness to direct my path— The prospect before me is all but hopeless— I have no encouragement to expect the accomplishment—all that it can be possible to affect may be the prevention of some evil— Heaven will at last vindicate its own justice by producing good out of evil—but not in my time— I wrote this day under great depression of drowsiness and devoted the whole evening to directing and franking 45 copies of my reception pamphlet address; with copies of the Oration of 4. July 1837 at Newburyport, of the tariff speech of 9. May 1840; of the speech on M’Leods case in August 1841. and of the Tariff veto report. "

                "text": "18. IV:45. Friday.  The rain continued through the Night and there was this morning when I rose a thick fog— I wrote the diary of yesterday—finished a Letter to the Editors of the Boston Atlas, containing a correction of the statement made in my reception address that the commander in chief of the army, General Scott is a Slaveholder. His sensitiveness to the imputation is a signal demonstration of the pungency of the general statement— He is a native of Virginia, and a very favorable specimen of the tribe— I inferred of course that he was a Slave holder, without reflecting that in his military capacity his life has been almost entirely spent in the free States, where he could not hold Slaves— His Letter has given me an opportunity at once to acknowledge the error of my statement respecting him, and to show that it is perfectly immaterial to the argument for which I adduced it, and also to touch again upon a Northern nerve, in a torpid state, to see if it cannot be quickened into sensation— I wrote also a notification to all the Lyceums, literary and political associations from which I have received invitations, to deliver before them Orations Lectures or Addresses, to apologize, with a grateful sense of their favours, for my inability not only to comply with their invitations, but even to answer the Letters in which they were conveyed— And I wrote to George Fuller, that I would meet him next Monday at the Office of the judge of probate in this City. After breakfast, I paid a visit to Mr Harrison Gray Otis, an acquaintance of nearly 60 years—long a self-constituted political rival and competitor—prosperous throughout life, in the pursuit, acquisition, and enjoyment of wealth, and now voluntarily retired from all public life, tortured from time to time by the gout but retaining a cheerful, gay, lively temper of mind, the most favourable perhaps of all to longevity— We talked of old times—not much of politics, but he told me, in confidence, of a greasy colloquial scene in the year 1816. which he witnessed between Philip Barbour the logician, and the lamented Harrison— My next visit was to Mr David Sears, who lives in the most magnificent, and most superbly furnished house in Boston, perhaps in the United States— Pictures, marble Statues, enamelled tables and splendid carpets and curtains, proclaim the abode rather of a European Prince than of a plain republican— Yet Mr Sears is not happy. He seldom resides in his palace, but strolls about the world residing at taverns and hotels.— Mr Sears recently left a card for me at my Son’s house, after at least fifteen years of unremembered acquaintance, and his reception of my return visit was very kind and cordial. I returned also the card visit of Robert C. Winthrop, but he was not at home. I left the Letter for George Fuller at the Post-Office— The Letter rectifying the error of imputing to General Scott the character of a Slave holder, and the notification to Lyceums, and literary associations with Mr Hayden at the Atlas Office—had an interview with Joseph T. Buckingham at his Office, and at 4. this afternoon came out in Gillet’s stage to Quincy. Elizabeth C. Adams and Ann Beale were in the same Stage. "

                "text": "18. IV:45. Friday.  The rain continued through the Night and there was this morning when I rose a thick fog— I wrote the diary of yesterday—finished a Letter to the Editors of the Boston Atlas, containing a correction of the statement made in my reception address that the commander in chief of the army, General Scott is a Slaveholder. His sensitiveness to the imputation is a signal demonstration of the pungency of the general statement— He is a native of Virginia, and a very favorable specimen of the tribe— I inferred of course that he was a Slave holder, without reflecting that in his military capacity his life has been almost entirely spent in the free States, where he could not hold Slaves— His Letter has given me an opportunity at once to acknowledge the error of my statement respecting him, and to show that it is perfectly immaterial to the argument for which I adduced it, and also to touch again upon a Northern nerve, in a torpid state, to see if it cannot be quickened into sensation— I wrote also a notification to all the Lyceums, literary and political associations from which I have received invitations, to deliver before them Orations Lectures or Addresses, to apologize, with a grateful sense of their favours, for my inability not only to comply with their invitations, but even to answer the Letters in which they were conveyed— And I wrote to George Fuller, that I would meet him next Monday at the Office of the judge of probate in this City. After breakfast, I paid a visit to Mr Harrison Gray Otis, an acquaintance of nearly 60 years—long a self-constituted political rival and competitor—prosperous throughout life, in the pursuit, acquisition, and enjoyment of wealth, and now voluntarily retired from all public life, tortured from time to time by the gout but retaining a cheerful, gay, lively temper of mind, the most favourable perhaps of all to longevity— We talked of old times—not much of politics, but he told me, in confidence, of a greasy colloquial scene in the year 1816. which he witnessed between Philip Barbour the logician, and the lamented Harrison— My next visit was to Mr David Sears, who lives in the most magnificent, and most superbly furnished house in Boston, perhaps in the United States— Pictures, marble Statues, enamelled tables and splendid carpets and curtains, proclaim the abode rather of a European Prince than of a plain republican— Yet Mr Sears is not happy. He seldom resides in his palace, but strolls about the world residing at taverns and hotels.— Mr Sears recently left a card for me at my Son’s house, after at least fifteen years of unremembered acquaintance, and his reception of my return visit was very kind and cordial. I returned also the card visit of Robert C. Winthrop, but he was not at home. I left the Letter for George Fuller at the Post-Office— The Letter rectifying the error of imputing to General Scott the character of a Slave holder, and the notification to Lyceums, and literary associations with Mr Hayden at the Atlas Office—had an interview with Joseph T. Buckingham at his Office, and at 4. this afternoon came out in Gillet’s stage to Quincy. Elizabeth C. Adams and Ann Beale were in the same Stage. "

Mr Robinson, the Minister of the episcopal church in this town called on me this morning, and said his people were building a house for him, and as he was fond of cultivating trees he would be obliged to me for a few seedling Oaks of my own planting. I went into the seminary, nursery and garden, and I pointed out to him a number of chesnut, black, American white and English white oaks from 2 to 7 years grown, and from which I authorised him to select and take away as many as he pleased. Isaac H. Adams came and told me that he proposed going with me to Washington to which I agreed, and told him I proposed to take my departure from Boston, on Tuesday the 29th. instt. He was going now to Boston in the 12. O Clock stage, which Gillet runs only on Saturdays— Ten minutes after he was gone my son came in from Boston—dined with us, and immediately after dinner returned— I had also a morning visit from an ex-inhabitant of the common jail, after a residence of 10 years upon a sentence for 12 years two of which have been remitted— He told me this himself, and presenting himself as a beggar told me by his looks that if I would not give he would find some way to take— His name he said was David Lamson—I compounded with him for half a dollar— Afternoon visit to take leave, from Mr Lunt— He spoke of his wish to build an house for himself, and of the necessity he should be under of borrowing money to accomplish it— I assured him that I would give him any assistance in my power to accomplish his purpose. My barber William Shaw told me that the Revd. John Gregory, Minister of the Universalist Church, whom the citizen voters of Quincy last Tuesday elected their Representative for the year 1843 in the Legislature of the Commonwealth, was the next day arrested, at the suit of Captain Drake, charged before Mr Clark a Magistrate in Roxbury, with the crime of bigamy and bound over to the court of common pleas at Dedham— The fact has been notorious these three years, but he has been sustained by white-washing certificates, till some of his flock have quarreled with him, and that has made him The Tom Fool of King Demus. He has taken to be a Saint in the total abstinence calendar which has ingratiated him with some of the weak witted whigs, and made him the representative of the town— It is as true as it is strange that in the workings of faction moral reform is converted into a deadly weapon of political corruption— I received a Letter from Mr Dunnell, of Providence fixing upon next Friday for the delivery of my lecture there— "

Cloudless sky The first beam appeared close at the left side of the temple steeple’s belfry; and rising passed behind it, clearing the right had pillar in five minutes, with his lower limb about half a disk above the horizon. The whole day was cloudless, with a stiff north western breeze, neutralizing the heat of the Sun, so that the feeling of the air was keen— Mr Lunt’s morning text was from Matthew 28.8. “And they departed quickly from the sepulchre, with fear and great joy”— After adverting cursorily, and very superficially to the historical narrative of this stupendous incident, Mr Lunt’s discourse was an ingenious dissertation upon fear and joy as co-ingredients of the genuine christian temper— But joy and fear are passions so adverse in their nature to each other, that they can exist in union only under extreme agitation of mind. How exquisitely joyous, and yet how awfully fearful must it have been to the two Marys on coming to the sepulchre of him whom they had two days before seen crucified, to meet an earthquake and an angel, rolling away the stone from the door of the Sepulchre, and telling them that Jesus was no longer there— Then immediately after seeing Jesus himself and receiving his commands to go and tell his disciples to go and meet him in Galilee—Oh!—how many deaths would it be the summit of bliss to endure for such a vision! The afternoon sermon was from Numbers 35.31. “Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.”— This was an argument to prove the necessity of capital punishment for murder, a question at this time very earnestly controverted, and upon which the spreading opinion of Christendom is for its abolition of the punishment of death. My own mind is strongly verging to that conclusion against the bent of my earliest impressions— My own experience of four years during which I possessed the power of remitting that penalty, and once or twice felt it my duty to suffer the execution of the Law, all but wrought conviction upon me tha the life of man should never be taken by the arm of the Law— Mr Lunt’s sermon is occasional— A man named Colt was under sentence of death for a very atrocious murder, and should have been executed last Friday at New-York— But he killed himself by a stab with a knife through the heart;—There are many nauseously romantic incidents connected with this case, which Mr Price Greenleaf told me, as we were walking over the hill homeward this after-noon— Mrs T. B. Adams, and her daughter Elizabeth were here, after meeting. I spent the Evening in addressing packets of speeches and addresses to my Constituents; and also the returns of Commerce and Navigation for 1841.— Eve of departure. "

It was this morning so cold that I was unable to write before breakfast, and finished reading an Article in the North American review for October of a new publication of th correspondence of Lord Chatham; the Article, is a very good one and was written by my Son; as was also an Article in the last preceding number of the same review, on the republished correspondence of Horace Walpole— I read also some pages of the autobiography of my ancestor Thomas Shepard the first of the name on this continent—And happening to look into one of the book cases in Charles’s Study, my hand guided by some instinct for which I cannot account, chanced to alight on a volume of Tracts, belonging to him, on opening which the first thing that met my eye was the opinion of the late judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, William Johnson of South-Carolina pronouncing the negro act of that State, for imprisoning coloured seamen arriving in the State, unconstitutional— At the last Session of Congress, I had moved a Resolution of the House of Representatives calling on the President calling for copies of a correspondence on this subject at the Department of State, and particularly of this opinion of judge Johnson. The President answered this Resolution, by Document 119. received 2d March last in which, furnishing the correspondence, and adding in so many words “I am not informed of the existence of any official opinion of the late judge Johnson on the unconstitutionality of the act or acts of the State of South Carolina, upon the subject referred to in the resolution”— I had been two years eagerly searching for this opinion, when it was now so unexpectedly cast in my way. I took it to the emancipator Office and showed it to Mr Leavitt, who promised to publish it in the paper together with the Document 119. But I wished to have them also both published in a paper of wider circulation, and took the volume to the Atlas Office, and proposed to Mr Hayden the publication of them in that paper, observing at the same time that I did not wish to press the request upon him, if it would be adverse to the political course of the paper— He said he would without hesitation publish them. I went again to obtain from Mr Leavitt the document 119. but he had lent his two copies of it; and promised to bring me one of them this afternoon— He came, but had not yet recovered it, and promised it again for to-morrow morning. Louisa C. Smith came and dined at my Son’s, and with her assistance and that of Mrs Charles I made up fourteen parcels of the jubilee of the Constitution, and of my reception address, substance of an impost duty speech and report on the second Tariff bill veto for further distribution— At the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, I obtained a copy of the Resolves of the Legislature of 8. April 1839. concerning certain Laws of other States, which affect the rights of Citizens of Massachusetts— Mr P. C. Brooks was here the first part of the Evening and at 8 I went with Charles and his wife to the glee-club party at Mr Joseph Joy’s, about 70 persons, and several songs in Chorus, with an Oyster supper till 11. at Night.

At 10 this morning I met, by appointment Mr Nathaniel Curtis, my Co-executor with Mrs Alicia Boylston of the Will of Ward Nicholas Boylston, and consulted with him on the Answer to be returned to Petty Vaughan’s Letters of 3. Decr 3 JanuaryMarchand 18. April and 4 May last, concerning monies which he has received, coming to the administration of Mr Boylston’s estate. We found it would be necessary to refer to previous Letters and accounts of Mr Vaughan to understand the precise effect of these last communications which Mr Curtis, who has the possessions of the papers agreed to do— I told Mr Curtis also of what had passed between me, and Mr George Fuller, with his counsel Mr Washburn, at the probate office last Monday— Mr Curtis was of opinion that it would be best for the interest of Mrs Boylston to renounce the claim to set off the note of Moses Gill to her from the amount to be paid to Fuller as Gill’s administrator, on account of the first Moses Gill’s share of the monies recovered from the French Government in the name and right of Thomas Boylston. I am myself of the same opinion: believing that although the money of the note was loaned in advance of the expected recovery from the French Government, and ought therefore to be deducted from it, yet as this does not appear on the face of the note, it would be impossible to prove it judicially in a suit at law,—and as by the total depretiation of the Stock in the Bank of the United States, the whole sum of nearly 1000 dollars has dwindled down to less than 30. the cost of a suit even in chancery or by an arbitration would exceed tenfold the amount recovered should it even terminate favourably to the claim of Mrs Boylston. I finally concluded to make an effort to see her at Providence next Friday.— After a conference of two hours with Mr Curtis I called to see my old Classmate judge Putnam at his house in Essex Street N. 10. but he was not at home— I made unsuccessful attempts to visit the new custom house and the globe bank Met in the street Captain Perceval whom I agreed to see at 4 this afternoon. He came at that time; and so did Mr Steele— Captain Perceval had minutes of several abuses in the management of the Navy Department which he wished to see corrected and Mr Steele had sent me a huge budget of prosing Letters, in support of a claim of his father for a revolutionary pension—between them they laid me fairly asleep—as if it had been by animal magnetism— I paid an evening visit at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s— A succession of visitors coming in, and going out all the time I was there— Among them was Peleg Sprague, the judge of the United District Court and his wife.

A crevice in one of the corners at the top of one of the closed window-shutters of the bed-chamber in which I slept, let in day light this morning and reminded me that my rising hour was long past, and I rose little before the Sun— It was pouring with rain, which continued steadily all the morning, till about 2 in the afternoon when it turned to snow with a heavy gale, the thermometer continuing to fall, till after Sunset when it cleared up—cold with bright star-light— At 11. A.M. I attended with my sons, and his two sons John and Charles at Dr Frothingham’s church and heard him preach from Ezekiel 34.25. “And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. 26. And I will make them, and the places round about my hill, a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down, in his season: there shall be showers of blessing. 27. And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the Lord”— he omitted the remainder of the verse—“when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.” The sermon was a beautiful exposition of the causes of gratitude to God, binding upon the people of this union, the last clause of the 27th. verse having been purposely avoided I suppose to exclude from the discourse any direct reference to the revolutionary War of Independence— The first hymn that he gave out to be sung was the 8th. of Mr Lunt’s Christian Psalter, being my version of the 67th. Psalm— Nothing could be more appropriate to the occasion;—but I pray for the forgiveness of God, for the sensation with which I heard my verses forming a part of the grateful devotions of a Christian assembly of worshipers.— The auditory was very thin the severity of the weather keeping almost every body housed at home— We all dined at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s, the party, excepting myself, consisting entirely of his children, their wives, husbands and children to the number of Edward Brooks without his wife but with one Son and one daughter. Peter C. Brooks junr and his wife—they are childless— He had paid me a visit after meeting this morning— Gorham Brooks, his wife andchildren. Dr. Frothingham his wife, Mr Brooks’s eldest daughter Ann, withsons anddaughters—and My Son Charles Francis with his wife Abigail Brown, Mr Brooks’s third and youngest daughter, with 3 Sons and one daughter— Their youngest Son Arthur an infant of 16 months not present. With Mr Brooks, Dr Frothingham and Charles I took a hand at whist in the Evening. We rode home between 9 and 10. p.m. "

In traveling yesterday from Boston to Natick the cars had scarcely reached Cambridge when they met a powdering of snow on the sides of the road; and this increased as we proceeded till on reaching Natick, the ground was wholly covered with frozen glassy Snow, which the Sun in a clear sky has not in two days been sufficient to thaw— This morning I was unable to rise before day light, having slept in a cold chamber and the morning continuing frosty, and showering snow— I rose with the Sun, breakfasted with Mr Wilson and his family, several of his neighbours, men and women came in after breakfast, till a quarter past 10. when I took leave of Mrs Wilson and her mother, and he walked with me to the Railway Station— Punctually at half past ten the train of Cars from Worcester came up, and in one of them I returned to Boston, with alternate snow and sunshine, on the way— Major Ripley from the Springfield Armoury was the only acquaintance whom I met in the Cars, and I did not recognize him till he spoke to me, and reminded me of his visit to me last winter— We reached Boston at half past 11 before the close of the morning service, but too late to attend it— I returned to Charles’s house, and after dinner heard at Dr Frothingham’s church an Irish man named Giles, deformed in person, with a beautiful mind— His discourse was from John 4.24 [“]God is a Spirit; and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.” The sermon was written in elegant language— It was upon the object and character of public worship. It was composed in the spirit of Christian Charity and social affection. But with some singularity of doctrine— It contained a parallel between the importance of preaching and of prayer; assigning a most decided preference for prayer, and quoting an extract from an English episcopalian writer, an argument to that point, with concurrence and approbation— He read his own prayer before the Sermon— Extemporaneous or formulary prayer is one of the most controverted points of dissent between the Episcopal and the congregational churches, and Mr Giles’s preference of prayer over preaching seemed uncongenial to a congregational unitarian pulpit— Christ prescribed a form of prayer of universal application— Socrates did the same; and those two forms embrace every thing, for which any human being under any circumstances need to pray—but social prayer, in prescribed forms becomes a mechanical exercise of Memory in which the heart has no concern. Returning from Church we encountered a Nova-Zemblan, Northwestern blast against which it was scarcely possible to make head. We spent the Evening at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s, to and from whose house Mrs Charles and I rode—Charles walked. Mr and Mrs Gorham Brooks, Mr and Mrs Peter C. Brooks, and Edward Brooks’s son, constituted the company— There was an oyster supper of which I freely partook and at half-past nine we came home. "

In traveling yesterday from Boston to Natick the cars had scarcely reached Cambridge when they met a powdering of snow on the sides of the road; and this increased as we proceeded till on reaching Natick, the ground was wholly covered with frozen glassy Snow, which the Sun in a clear sky has not in two days been sufficient to thaw— This morning I was unable to rise before day light, having slept in a cold chamber and the morning continuing frosty, and showering snow— I rose with the Sun, breakfasted with Mr Wilson and his family, several of his neighbours, men and women came in after breakfast, till a quarter past 10. when I took leave of Mrs Wilson and her mother, and he walked with me to the Railway Station— Punctually at half past ten the train of Cars from Worcester came up, and in one of them I returned to Boston, with alternate snow and sunshine, on the way— Major Ripley from the Springfield Armoury was the only acquaintance whom I met in the Cars, and I did not recognize him till he spoke to me, and reminded me of his visit to me last winter— We reached Boston at half past 11 before the close of the morning service, but too late to attend it— I returned to Charles’s house, and after dinner heard at Dr Frothingham’s church an Irish man named Giles, deformed in person, with a beautiful mind— His discourse was from John 4.24 [“]God is a Spirit; and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.” The sermon was written in elegant language— It was upon the object and character of public worship. It was composed in the spirit of Christian Charity and social affection. But with some singularity of doctrine— It contained a parallel between the importance of preaching and of prayer; assigning a most decided preference for prayer, and quoting an extract from an English episcopalian writer, an argument to that point, with concurrence and approbation— He read his own prayer before the Sermon— Extemporaneous or formulary prayer is one of the most controverted points of dissent between the Episcopal and the congregational churches, and Mr Giles’s preference of prayer over preaching seemed uncongenial to a congregational unitarian pulpit— Christ prescribed a form of prayer of universal application— Socrates did the same; and those two forms embrace every thing, for which any human being under any circumstances need to pray—but social prayer, in prescribed forms becomes a mechanical exercise of Memory in which the heart has no concern. Returning from Church we encountered a Nova-Zemblan, Northwestern blast against which it was scarcely possible to make head. We spent the Evening at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s, to and from whose house Mrs Charles and I rode—Charles walked. Mr and Mrs Gorham Brooks, Mr and Mrs Peter C. Brooks, and Edward Brooks’s son, constituted the company— There was an oyster supper of which I freely partook and at half-past nine we came home. "

Dead of Winter  Mr Paine visited me Saturday morning, after my return from Providence, and conversed with me an hour or more upon Astronomy and his desire to visit Europe, and Lord Ross’s Mammoth Telescope—and he gave me the plan of an Observatory at Washington authorised by an Act of Congress of the last Session. He spoke very bitterly of Hassler, who is not a light burden upon the Country— This morning I had a long visit from my old Classmate at Cambridge and fellow student at Newbury port Samuel Putnam, who has been many years a judge of the Supreme Court of this Commonwealth; but falling into the infirmities of old age, resigned last winter his seat upon the bench— He has prospered in the world and has a family of eight children, all respectably married and settled— We called over the roll of our Class, and mutually communicated to each other what we knew of their lives and adventures. A chequered scene of honour and shame, of prosperity and adversity; of the enjoyments, services, vicissitudes and destinies of human life. Of the whole number about one fourth yet survive. Not all distinguished not all honoured—none disgraced—forming on the whole a creditable specimen of the age in which they have lived—of their Country, and of the learned institution which ushered them into the world— Mr Curtis called on me, and went with me to the probate Office, to make the final settlement of the claim of George Fuller as administrator of Moses Gill upon me as Administrator de bonis non of Thomas Boylston— But Mr Fuller was not there and although it was past one O’Clock had not been there this day— I had not been able to find among my papers the 25 shares of stock in the Bank of the United States from which I am to transfer to Mr Fuller a number sufficient to discharge his claim as Administrator of Gill— This settlement must be deferred till next Spring, if it please God so long to preserve so long my life and health and self-possession— It must then be no longer postponed. Mr Curtis urged me to write an answer to Petty Vaughan, which I promised to do this day or to-morrow Morning— I purchased two pair of worsted socks for winter’s wear, and a couple of rings for preserving hair— Dr Bigelow, Mr P. C. Brooks, I. P. Davis, Dr Frothingham, Dr Palfrey and President Quincy dined at my Son’s with us, a party made and selected in kind feeling to me, and exquisite in all its parts. I had sent to Mr Quincy a budget of my pamphlet speeches Orations and Addresses, with a Latin dedication commemorative of our long and uninterrupted friendship—with which he was much gratified— It was a charming symposium— Degrand came also in the evening to bid me farewell— I wrote Letters to Josiah Randall at Philadelphia and to General Scott at Washington, to enclose my Letter to the Editors of the Atlas concerning him.

Thursday  We breakfasted at Jones’s Union Hotel— I had risen at half past 3. which being earlier than my regular time I returned to bed till 5. and then wrote till past seven and had not quite completed my task when breakfast was announced and the porter came for our trunks. The steam-boat line to Wilmington is closed by the ice in the Delaware— In the middle of the night the rain had given way to sharp frost and the streets were one glare of frozen snow and ice— Last evening I met at the tea-table Mr John Barney just in by the train from Baltimore, who said it had begun to snow there before daylight that morning and that he had travelled through the snow the whole day; with the roads at last so beclog’d that they were belated upwards of two hours in reaching Philadelphia.— The Streets were so slippery that we took a Cab to go to the ticket office in market street, and when we got there we found two cars in the street frozen down by the wheels to the street so that we were told it would require a forty horsepower to start the one in which we were to travel— I thought we should be obliged to go back to Jones’s and pass the day at Philadelphia. Passengers for Baltimore however kept flocking to the ticket Office, and among them were Mrs Commodore Morris and her daughter, Mrs Harper, Mr and Mrs Eastman of New-Hampshire, and Mr Toland, the member H.R.U.S. from Philadelphia; and Dr Sutherland was there bustling round, with every sort of kind office to me, till at last he bought for two cents a morning paper of one of the Mercury’s of the daily press, flitting round, and gave it to me, saying there—put that in your pocket— It has got the trial for murder. I had already provided myself with the United States Gazette of the morning, but excepted with thanks the Doctor’s present— They packed me up with all the Ladies in the outer car fronting the Office, to which they tackled horses, and with much and repeated effort started loose from the street; and took us round to another Car which had been housed in the night, and was thus movable for travel, and with this we proceeded on our way.— The two O’Clock morning train from Baltimore had not come in— We were upwards of two hours belated in reaching Wilmington— We had nearly reached the Susquehan. when we met the Cars of the 2. O’Clock morning Baltimore train deserted by their passengers who had been out all Night; and at the Susquehannah we met the 9 O’Clock train of this Morning— We reached Baltimore at 5 in the afternoon. The Cars for Washington; so we walked to Barnum’s Hotel, and took lodgings for the Night. He gave us a room with a wood fire; and after half an hour of conversation with Mr David Hoffman I wrote out the Evening. "

Thursday  We breakfasted at Jones’s Union Hotel— I had risen at half past 3. which being earlier than my regular time I returned to bed till 5. and then wrote till past seven and had not quite completed my task when breakfast was announced and the porter came for our trunks. The steam-boat line to Wilmington is closed by the ice in the Delaware— In the middle of the night the rain had given way to sharp frost and the streets were one glare of frozen snow and ice— Last evening I met at the tea-table Mr John Barney just in by the train from Baltimore, who said it had begun to snow there before daylight that morning and that he had travelled through the snow the whole day; with the roads at last so beclog’d that they were belated upwards of two hours in reaching Philadelphia.— The Streets were so slippery that we took a Cab to go to the ticket office in market street, and when we got there we found two cars in the street frozen down by the wheels to the street so that we were told it would require a forty horsepower to start the one in which we were to travel— I thought we should be obliged to go back to Jones’s and pass the day at Philadelphia. Passengers for Baltimore however kept flocking to the ticket Office, and among them were Mrs Commodore Morris and her daughter, Mrs Harper, Mr and Mrs Eastman of New-Hampshire, and Mr Toland, the member H.R.U.S. from Philadelphia; and Dr Sutherland was there bustling round, with every sort of kind office to me, till at last he bought for two cents a morning paper of one of the Mercury’s of the daily press, flitting round, and gave it to me, saying there—put that in your pocket— It has got the trial for murder. I had already provided myself with the United States Gazette of the morning, but excepted with thanks the Doctor’s present— They packed me up with all the Ladies in the outer car fronting the Office, to which they tackled horses, and with much and repeated effort started loose from the street; and took us round to another Car which had been housed in the night, and was thus movable for travel, and with this we proceeded on our way.— The two O’Clock morning train from Baltimore had not come in— We were upwards of two hours belated in reaching Wilmington— We had nearly reached the Susquehan. when we met the Cars of the 2. O’Clock morning Baltimore train deserted by their passengers who had been out all Night; and at the Susquehannah we met the 9 O’Clock train of this Morning— We reached Baltimore at 5 in the afternoon. The Cars for Washington; so we walked to Barnum’s Hotel, and took lodgings for the Night. He gave us a room with a wood fire; and after half an hour of conversation with Mr David Hoffman I wrote out the Evening. "

Smith was here when I arrived yesterday but went immediately after to Mr Frye’s.— I slept last night in the chamber immediately over our usual bed-chamber, and rose this morning at my purposed usual time— Call at the Bank of the Metropolis and drew a check for the balance of my account there. I had drawn on the 5th. of Septr. a check for 1500 dollars which I had neglected to enter in my bank book, which had the appearance of a balance so much larger in my favour— As I was returning home I was accosted by Mr Tibbits, an inventor of some Steam-engine safety-valve, which he says I introduced into the House of Representatives for him in 1836. and that I then went and examined the model of his invention which was not perfected. I had forgotten the fact, but had some recollection of it, thus reminded— He says it is now perfected and he wishes me to introduce a memorial, to the House of Representatives about it again—which I consented to do— He told me a long story, about an Act of Congress passed in 1838. making an appropriation for experimenting upon his machine; but of which he has never been able to obtain the execution— He told it in such a disjointed manner that I could not half understand him; but he intreated me to go and see his safety valve again; it being now at Georgetown; which I promised to do, if I can find leisure— I wasted an hour in searching for his alledged act of Congress without finding it— I went to the Capitol and took the key of my draw, as the earnest of my seat—ordered some Stationery; and the deficient sheets of the House Journal with the Index and found sundry Letters and Newspapers at the Post-Office; where I met Sampson Mason of Ohio— He told me he should not come to the next Congress. Isaac Hull went with me to see his brother Joseph Harrod at Mrs Peyton’s but we met him in the Street, and he came and dined with us— Mr Boardman of New-Haven, and Mr Nowlan Commissioner of the public buildings paid me a morning visit— Mr Boardman came on with General Scott, Mr Bowne and General Hernandez, Wednesday Evening from Philadelphia, and were out the whole night and great part of Thursday before they reached Baltimore— Mr William Wilson a presbyterian Clergyman, of the College on Staten-Island, chartered by the Legislature of New-York, called to see me, and as he went away just hinted to me that there might be a chance for his election to the chaplaincy of the House of Representatives. Walter Hellen was here this afternoon, and Mr Frye this evening. He left with me a Lease prepared for signing and sealing of the house next to J. P. Van Ness’s to W. Darby as was agreed the day before we departed hence in September. Darby has hitherto occupied the house on a written Memorandum— "

                "text": "4. IV:30 Sunday.  From the extreme cold of the last week the temperature of the atmosphere has changed to a general thaw. I attended public worship this morning at the second Presbyterian church where Mr Joseph P. Moore preached from Matthew 4.17.— “Jesus began to preach”— I had heard Mr Moore many times before but this discourse both for style and thought was much superior to any thing that I had noticed in his former Sermons— His manner was cold and heavy; and his composition not above mediocrity— It was not so now. He was indeed somewhat monotonous and stiff, but occasionally rose as if inspired by his theme into considerable animation— There was an ornamented phraseology which I had never before remarked in Mr Moore’s Sermons, and in commenting upon the transcendent importance to the history of mankind of that point of time, when “Jesus began to preach” he presented a parallel between the humility of his condition, a poor obscure peasant, the son of a Jewish Carpenter, in a corner of the Roman province of Galilee, and the glories of the Roman empire then at the summit of power, and seated as if upon an eternal throne, contrasted with that stupendous revolution in human affairs, that downfall of the Roman Empire, and that revision, reversal, and purification of the Mosaic Law, which was to be accomplished by this lowly preacher, which forcibly struck my imagination— Then in descanting upon the nature and character of the Saviour’s instructions, upon the universality of their application to every condition of human life—to the rich and the poor, to both sexes, to infancy and age, to all the relations of domestic life; the exquisite adaption of his parables to the best feelings of the human heart—the prodigal son, the good Samaritan, the repenting Magdalen, the sower and the seed the steward and the household; there ran through all this a vein of philosophy, such as I am little accustomed to expect from the everlasting atonement of a presbyterian calvinist— I have seldom heard a more edifying and pleasing discourse— There was another person named Sheldon in the pulpit— A new comer— Mr Clarke has left the church for a better settlement elsewhere.— After dinner at St. John’s church Mr Tiffany read the evening prayers for the second Sunday in advent; and preached from 1. Corinthians 10.12. “Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.”— What a world of wisdom in those few words! Oh that I could profitably and unremittingly lay them to heart! The Sermon was passable, but not so impressive as the text— After church, I visited Mr Johnson, and sat in conversation with him half an hour. He is hypocondriac from solitude—irrecoverable from debility, and in hourly expectation of a final paralytic shock, which may linger on for years— Mary quite unwell. "

Congress commences— I was absorbed in reading the Letters and papers received by the mail this morning till I was belated in reaching the Hall of the House of Representatives— The house had been in Session ten minutes when I took my seat, and they were occupied in calling the roll of members by States when I entered. 174 members answered to their names. Caleb Cushing moved the message to the Senate, and the appointment of a joint-committee to wait on the President and inform him that the two houses are assembled, and ready to receive any communication from him— Tillinghast moved the appointment of a joint library Committee— The usual orders were passed for the supply of newspapers equal to 3. daily to each member. Horace Everett gave notice that he would to-morrow or as soon as may be move to introduce a bill to repeal the bankrupt act— I gave notice that I would to-morrow move a resolution to rescind the 21st. rule, which excludes abolition petitions from reception— Henry A. Wise objected to the reception of my motion but as it was only notice of my intention to offer a resolution, he could not exclude it.— W. Cost Johnson also manifested a disposition to object to the reception of the resolution, and Turney of Tennessee told me I began early with my hot shot— The order for the appointment of Chaplains was passed— The Clerk came back from the Senate chamber with notice that they had not formed a Quorum and at half past 12 the house adjourned till 12 to-morrow. Some 30 members, all but one or two of them whigs came and shook hand with me at my seat, and the mutual greeting appeared all round friendly and good humoured— After the adjournment I called at the Bank of Washington, and received 48.75 a quarters interest—due 1. Octr. last on city corporation 6 per cents, then at the Franklin insurance Office, and received 316.75 dividend of 1. November on 1267. shares of the Stock— Mr Grammar told me the directors had at their last meeting determined to call for a renewal of the stock notes, the amount of mine being 25340 dollars— I received the money in Virginia bills at the patriotic bank. Called at the National Intelligencer Office and saw Mr Gales. I asked him to republish my Letter of 18 Novr. to the Editors of the Atlas, relating to General Scott. He had the slip from the Atlas of 19. Novr on his table, and promised to publish it to morrow, but hinted that the publication of it, and of the address itself of 17. September, had been a hazardous thing for him— He gave me a New-York American, containing my Letters to Lord Wellesley and to Mr M’Tavish, and my translation of the Latin lines upon Milton, republished from Epes Sargent’s Miscellany, mangled— Mr Gales said that he wished to republish them with Lord Wellesley’s Letter to me. I received this my certificate of election to the 28th. Congress. "

Tuesday  Mr William Darby the Geographer came this morning to discuss the rent, and repairs and purchase of the house next to Captain Carbery’s which he rented for 5 years in September last— He descanted much upon the amount of his expenditures for repairs, upon the gravity of the rent, and finally upon his desire to purchase the house; which I promised to take into consideration, and to name a price which I would take for it, and to give him an answer in the course of a week. Mr Lewis Johnson came to enquire if I had received any recent advices from Mr John Otis of Barnstable— I had not heard from him for several months. Nor had Mr Johnson, which he thought extraordinary; Johnson’s last Letter to him, that there was a considerable sum receivable by him from the amount recovered from the Government of the United States, upon the claims of his deceased brother William Otis— At the house— No Quorum of the Senate yet— I now offered my Resolution that the 21st. rule, excluding abolition petitions from reception should be rescinded.— Wise objected again to the reception of the resolution. The Speaker decided that it was in order.— Wise protested against the decision, but did not venture to appeal— Weller of Ohio moved to lay the resolution on the table, lost by yeas and nays 84 to 93. Horace Everett moved the previous question— There was a second; but the house refused to take the main question now, that is, this day—by yeas and nays 84 to 99.— The old game is playing over again by the Northern democratic alliance with Southern Slavery— John Thomson Mason of Maryland announced the sudden decease of his colleague James W. Williams; and pronounced a frigid panegyric upon his character. He died last week in his carriage, within 3. miles of his own house, on his way to Washington, to attend the Session of Congress.— Mason offered the usual resolutions of sympathising sensibility; to wear crape 30 days, and to adjourn all which were adopted of course— I had a visit by card from the new Mexican Minister General Almonte— Walter Hellen was here this Evening. My wife and Mrs John Adams are yet both confined to their chambers and chiefly to their beds— With the certificate of my election to the 28th. Congress from the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts under the new apportionment the Secretary of the State John P. Bigelow has sent me a list of the votes cast in the 31. towns— The whole number was 11873. including 296 from Milton returned too late to be counted— The vote for J. Q. Adams was 6149 for Ezra Wilkinson 5559. for William Jackson 149. and for thirteen other persons 16— Necessary to a choice 5937.— My absolute majority was 212. Over Wilkinson 590— The votes for William Jackson were all whig abolitionists 72 of which were from the town of Weymouth— Wilkinson is a young lawyer of Dedham. "

                "text": "7. IV. Wednesday.  At the meeting of the House this morning W. Cost Johnson moved that 5000 copies of a document of the last Session, called upon a resolution offered by me, containing a statement of the debts of the several States, should be printed—but his motion was laid on the table.— I called up my resolution for rescinding the 21st. rule—The Speaker decided that although the house had yesterday decided that they would not then put the main question, to rescind, it was still under the operation of the previous question, which must now be put again. I did not appeal from the decision but observed that I had always understood that the refusal to put the main question now, exhausted the previous question, and left the main question debatable. Other members were more refractory than I was. Everett remonstrated. W. Cost Johnson moved to lay the Resolution on the Table—lost by yeas and nays 90. to 91. Then the previous question was again put and lost 91 to 93. Underwood still contested the decision of the Speaker who said the subject must lie over till to morrow, and then the majority will lay the resolution on the table. Bidlack asked to be excused from voting on that question and then defined his position.— He said he had always voted with the South on this delicate question, and believed he should still; as long as the South held together—but he saw that this day, some of the members from Virginia and Kentucky voting the other way.— The Senate at last formed a Quorum this day— The joint Committee were despatched with notice to the President, and Cushing chairman of the house committee reported that he would sent a Message forthwith; and it accordingly came in soon after. Cushing moved the printing of 10000 copies extra which was carried— The message begins with a double dose of pious gratitude for the continuous, health plenty, and prosperity all over the country— Then crows at the conclusion of the Treaty with Great Britain—and urges the necessity of further negotiation upon many other points yet unsettled. Crows over an adjustment present and prospective of the difficulties with Mexico— Pleads like a sturdy beggar, for the adoption by Congress, for the Exchequer plan, which he prepared for them and sent them last year, and concludes with a recommendation to Congress to pay back to General Jackson with interest the fine imposed upon him by judge Hall at New Orleans in 1815—which occasioned some laughter as a sop for Cerberus.— Botts asked me seriously if I was ready to help him in his impeachment of Captain Tyler; and Toland shewed me a Resolution he proposed to offer for an investigation of the causes of the removal of Jonathan Roberts as Collector at Philadelphia.

Randolph, from New-Jersey, with Mr Richards one of the missionaries to the Sandwich Islands and a native of those Islands, a Secretary of the King— A strong stout built man, nearly black as an Ethiopian, but with a European face and wool for hair— They came from the Sandwich Islands in July last, landed atin Mexico—traversed the continent to Vera Cruz and came thence in our War Steamer Missouri— Haa-lee-lee-o. has a commission as Ambassador from the king of the Sandwich Islands to this Country, to Great Britain and to France; and is to assume the character first here—or in Europe at his discretion— Mr Richards expressed a very earnest desire for conversation with me on this subject; for my advice to the Ambassador, and for Letters of recommendation from me to persons of distinction and influence in Europe— I said I would very cheerfully converse with him and give him any advice and assistance in my power; but I had no acquaintance of distinction or influence in Europe; Mr Richards said they had visited Mr Webster, and made known to him the object of their mission, which was to obtain an acknowledgment of their Independence, and of their neutrality; and Mr Webster had advised them, not to make any present movement here, but to commence their diplomatic operations in England— I did not see the wisdom, of leaving to Great-Britain the option, of assuming the Islands under her protection, like the Ionian Islands—but I see the motive for Webster’s advice, which is that they are black. I promised to see them again on Saturday morning. At the house sundry other members took their seats, and Burch told me there were two hundred and nine members of the house in the city— My Resolution to rescind the 21st rule came up again; Mr Underwood contested the decision of the Speaker that the previous question remained in force after the house have refused to take the question now; but the Speaker cited two precedents, one in 1828. and one at the last Session, which he thought sustained him, which Everett and Underwood did not admit. Underwood appealed from the decision but the appeal was laid on the table— John W. Jones moved to lay my Resolution on the table—lost 93 to 95. And the house for the 3d. time voted that the main question should not be put now—95 to 100.— W. Cost Johnson moved a resolution, to rescind the one hour rule, but his motion was laid on the table 116 to 70— The house adjourned over to Monday. Mr Weems was here again this Evening. He has concluded to address a memorial to the house in defence of himself against the abominable charges, in the pamphlet of William A. Weaver, a knave employed by the Secretary of State John Forsyth to superintend the preparation for publication of the census returns, and who under that authority made out a job for himself, by which Weems says, he got at least 10000 dollars, at the expence of the country.

This was a day of leisure, and I had intended to employ it in visiting several of the public departments, but I left my papers here last September in such a state of utter confusion that one of my indispensable duties since my return has been to find and file them in due order alphabetically month by month, from February when by the pressure of my trial upon my time, the disorder began till September when I left the city. This task will absorb all my leisure till the close of the present year at least. My practice is to file all the letters that I receive, and each month makes a file as large as can be conveniently kept together—but so worthless is the great mass of my passive correspondence, that if the letters having the slightest claim to preservation were sifted from the chaff one yearly file would more than suffice for the twelve Calendar Months. Besides these I have miscellaneous files of Newspapers containing Articles of special interest to which I wish occasionally to refer.— And all together the form a mass of Archives, for which I have not chests and boxes and bureaus and drawers sufficient in numbers and capacity to contain them.— A separate building for a library of book cases and receptacles for the safe keeping of manuscripts has become almost a necessary of life to me; but I have not the means of erecting it— Will it be the good fortune of my Son? If it should ever be in his power I enjoin it upon him as a duty— I was this morning so long engaged in filing and endorsing Letters, that dinner time had come when I had barely finished the record of yesterday. As morning visitors Messrs. Goggin Powell, Summers and Stuart of Virginia came together; and afterwards Mr Sherlock J. Andrews of Ohio, with Maxwell and Yorke of New-Jersey— Dr Thomas was also here, to visit my wife and Mrs John Adams, both of whom are still confined to their chambers, and nearly the whole time to their beds. After dinner I took a walk of half an hour till the dusk for fresh air and in the Evening answered the Letter from Messrs. Dunnell and Rodman of the Franklin Lyceum at Providence, requesting a copy of my Lecture on the Social compact for publication. I send the copy as delivered at Boston, considering the objections to the quotation from Milton’s Paradise lost as fancies of over-fastidious delicacy. I received also this evening the Hampshire Gazette of 6. Decr. printed at Northampton, and with it a pamphlet edition of my reception address to my Constituents at Braintree on the 17th. of September last— The 4 members of the house, who were overset in the stage coming from Zanesville Caruthers, Gentry, Wallace and Lane, arrived here, this day, not wholly recovered from their wounds— Smith, the Senator from Indiana, still remains behind.

                "text": "10. VI. Saturday.  Mr Richards the Missionary to the Sandwich Islands was again here this morning, without the native Islander Ha-lee-lee-o. who is indisposed. They have seen Mr Webster again; and he has promised to introduce them to the President, and to give a written answer to their proposals. The conversion and civilization of these Islands by the agency of the missionaries forms an era in the history of man— Their population is about 100 thousand and they have 23 churches, and 20000 communicants— Idolatry is totally extinguished— They have a written constitution formed by successive representative Assemblies— A representative government in three branches, legislative, executive and judicial—laws for the security of property and the preservation of order and schools where reading, writing and arithmetic are taught. They cultivate potatoes of both kinds, rice, maize, and some wheat, and breed the various kinds of tame animals in abundance— It is strange, and discouraging to think that under all these improvements the population diminishes in numbers— Mr Richards promised to see me again after their interview with the President— I took to the General Post-Office a petition of Isaac Ellis and 53 others, for a Post-Office at South Dedham with a recommendation of John E. Boyden as the Postmaster— Mr Wickliffe was at the President’s; but the second Assistant Postmaster General, Mr Bryant supposed the petition would be granted. I left with him the recommendatory Letter of William Ellis— On my way I met Tillinghast, who was going to my house, with a pamphlet copy of the new, Constitution of Rhode-Island; which I had asked of him and which he gave me. At the Globe Office I bespoke an entire set of the Congressional Globe, in ten quarto Volumes— At the war-office; the Secretary, Spencer was at the President’s I left with Genl. Parker, the chief clerk, applications, for Cadet Warrants for Isaac L. Hedge junr of Plymouth, and James Milner Robinson of Quincy— I met at the Office Genl. Scott, and Dr Knott— At the Navy Department I saw the Secretary Upshur, and left with him an application for a midshipman’s warrant for John C. Bell of Roxbury— Mr Upshur said, that if Congress should persist in their retrenchments of the Navy of the last Session there could not be a new appointment of a Midshipman within thirty years.— Mr Upshur’s coldness and crustiness of manner indicated that  he keenly felt the strictures that I have made upon the absurd extravagance of his report to the President at the commencement of the last Session of Congress.— With an estimate exceeding 8 millions of dollars for the current year, gravely urging that we must raise a navy at least equal to half that of Great-Britain and then stating that her present naval force was more than eight times more numerous than ours. This with a bankrupt Treasury, and an imbecil impotence of raising revenue even for the current expenses of the year, stamped the character of the administration for economy in characters indelible— It was equally demonstrative of its insincerity or of its reckless stupidity. I have commented upon it with ample freedom— Mr Upshur was peevish in his complaints of the insignificence of the force which we could keep with the present paltry appropriations, in the Mediterranean, on the coast of Africa, in the East-India seas, and on the pacific Ocean— I said that when the Treasury should be replenished we might be more liberal of appropriations— He said that was the affair of Congress  We had this day numerous visitors by cards as the margins of both these pages will show. Mr Darby came twice— I offered him the house in which he now lives for 2000 dollars; but he could not make out a satisfactory mode of payment, and he concluded to execute the lease for ten years prepared by Mr Frye, which he took for the purpose of writing the counterpart for his own keeping— Mr George Brown of Beverly was here, still place hunting, and now quite willing for the re-election of John Tyler as President, because he would keep Daniel Webster as Secretary of State— Mr Brown differs in opinion with me upon the annexation of Texas, and is quite enchanted with the prospect of Mr Waddy Thompson’s obtaining from Mexico the cession of California to the United States— News announced in the National Intelligencer of this morning, and countenanced by a paragraph in the President’s Message— Mr Brown is also here to write Letters for the Mercantile Journal at Boston. He asked me, if I did not take it— Mr Barnard and his daughter Cora were here before dinner and Mr Van Rensselaer—and while we were at dinner Richard D. Cutts— I was shocked yesterday on seeing announced in the globe of the evening before the death of my old and frequent visitor Colonel James Thomas— I left him here in September, a picture of health.

                "text": "11. IV:45 Sunday.  A flight of Snow—soon dissolved. I attended public worship this morning at the Presbyterian Church and heard Mr Sheldon the new preacher engaged to supply the pulpit— His text was Isaiah 51.1–3. [“]1. Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord: look unto the rock, whence ye are hewn and to the hole of the pit, whence, ye are digged— 3. For the Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places, and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.” There is no point in this text, to make it occasionally appropriate— The preacher is quite a young man anxious and timid ambitious of originality, but without much compass of thought or energy of expression. There was not much attraction in his manner, nor much edification in his matter— Perhaps he may improve. After church Mr Benjamin Rush paid me a visit and after dinner a wild man named Silas Lamsan, a native he says of Boylston in the County of Worcester, Massachusetts— They call him a Dunker. He talks in the singular number thou and thee, but does not profess to be a quaker— He has the new testament at his tongues end, and rails against the priesthood in professed imitation of Jesus Christ’s denunciation of the pharisees— He told me he had suffered insult, and persecution and imprisonment for following the example of Christ who overthrew the tables of the money changers and turned them out of the temple, saying that they had made the house of God a den of thieves. He said he had a patent for an invention of his own; a scythe handle, well known and he dared say I had heard of Lamson’s Scythe-handle; but I had not— He wears a beard and a shabby suit of white cloth; with a long surtout and Spencer over it; and a white jockey cap looking altogether like a miller powdered over with flour— He detained me so long, by his persevering effort at religious disputation that I was belated at St. John’s church, and found Mr Hawley just about reading the creed—for the 3d Sunday in advent. He preached from Isaiah, without naming the chapter and verse, but it was 11.10. “And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.” Mr Hawley said this text was appropriate to the season of the advent of the Saviour; being prophetic of that great aera in the history of the human race; but he gave himself no trouble to explain how the birth of the Saviour, is foreshadowed by the prophet of the age of Hezekiah. This prophesy of Isaiah is a mystery of the darkest order; and requires theologians of the first class for learning and ingenuity to help it along. In the evening I finished revising the manuscript copy, made by Isaac Hull Adams of my Lecture upon the Social compact, and I enclosed it adressed to Messrs. Dunnell and Rodman at Providence Rhode-Island. Dr. Thomas was also here to visit his two patients, yet confined— "

Mr Darby came this morning, and we executed the lease for ten years, of the house in Square 173. from the 6th. of last September, at a rent of 150 dollars a year, payable quarterly; but he to expend the first years rent in repairs— He says he has already expended two thirds of that amount. I promised to go and see the house. John Hodgkin came with a petition which he requested me to present to the house, for payment of the balance of a bill of more than 7000 dollars for painting the New-York Custom-house. I promised to present it— At the House— My Resolution to rescind the 21st. rule was laid on the table by yeas and nays 106 to 102. Absent 31. dead 2. Speaker 1. Of the 34. 19 would have voted ay. 15 no. The vote of the whole House would have been 125 to 117 or possibly 122 to 120— The standing committees had been announced—all the same as the last Session; except the cases of members now absent. On the Committee of foreign Affairs, the only change from the close of the last Session, is of Holmes in the place of Edward D. White, who is not here. Holmes was one of those who being of the batch appointed by the speaker after the majority of members resigned serving on the committee because they could not turn me out as chairman; requested also to be excused and was excused from serving on the same grounds.— I am curious to see whether he will now ask to be excused from serving with me again— Fillmore, chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means now moved several Resolutions to refer the several topics of the Presidential Message to the appropriate standing committees—hence a desultory debate Pickens moved the reference of the whole message to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, and Cushing proposed to refer the President’s exchequer to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take it out of the hands of the Committee of Ways and Means supposed to be hostile to the President— Cushing’s proposed amendment failed by a small majority, and Fillmore’s resolution were all adopted with an additional one proposing enquiries about appropriations for internal improvements in the west and on the lakes. There was some inflammable chaffering about this, and about the recommendation by the President of a bill to refund the fine imposed upon General Jackson for the exercise of martial law by General Jackson at New-Orleans 27 years ago— Adjourned at 3. O’Clock After dinner, there came a Clergyman, named Thaddeus Osgood, a native of Massachusetts, but now and for many years settled at Montreal in Canada. He craves a contribution to build a protestant church there— I was not in funds. At the theatre— Hackett’s benefit Falstaff in the Merry wives of Windsor. Then, Monsieur Mallet, a Napoleonide fort touchant—and then the Militia training— Hackett, Major Joe Bunker—farcical—home at Midnight— "

In overhauling my chaotic files of letters and papers received during the last Session for assortment and endorsement, I find some that I had wasted hours in searching for in vain—others that I had not even read: among which one from William Allen of Northampton on the religious opinions of my father, in refutation of a cankered Article in an English review of my father’s Letters published by my Son— The reading of this paper took up more than an hour— Its length was the reason of my filing of it unread, when it was received— The Article of the English Review is mere venom, which is not worthy of notice from me— At the house Fillmore obtained leave for the Committee of Ways and Means to employ a Clerk. John M. Botts, raised a question of privilege upon a Letter from John C. Spencer, Secretary of War, published in the Albany Argus of 25. October, immediately before the recent elections in the State of New York in defence of John Tyler, and containing bases charges against the leaders of the whig party, at the time of the vetos on the two Bank bills— The amount of the charge is that between the first and second Bank veto the leaders of the whig party, proposed to the President to postpone the Bank question to the next Session if he would promise in the mean time not to dismiss any of the members of his then cabinet—and that Tyler rejected the proposal with scorn.— Botts considered this as a charge of corruption against the leaders of the whig party, and so it was intended by Spencer; but Wise and Cushing and Irwin succeeded in slipping through it by parrying it as a Privileged question, which could be carried by a majority; and then voting for as suspension of the rules to let it in by a vote of two thirds which they knew could not be carried— After a long skirmishing between Botts and Wise and doubling of corners by the Speaker the house by yeas and nays 85 to 106. refused to receive the resolution as a question of privilege— After which Everett obtaine a suspension of the rules to introduce his bill to repeal the Bankrupt act— Many were clamorous to pass it at once, but it was finally made the special order of the day for next Tuesday— Underwood then moved a suspension of the rules to introduce Botts’s investigating enquiry, vote for which was 78 to 109—a majority, but not two thirds.— Some testimony was received, and a squall arose upon a motion of Morgan to refer it to the Committee of Elections, in the midst of which the house adjourned.— I notified the members of the Committee of foreign Affairs to meet to-morrow at 11. This evening I was visited by Commander J. S. Paine of the Navy who asked my opinion whether Theodore Paine is a purser in the Navy or not, and he left with me an opinion of Samuel Fessenden that he is. "

The part of the President’s Message relating to the foreign Affairs, read to the Committee, was the only matter as yet referred by the house to the Committee; and Mr Cushing, observing that there was nothing in it which seemed to require any immediate action of the Committee moved that the Committee do meet every Tuesday Morning at 11. O’Clock till further order, which was adopted without opposition; whereupon the Committee forthwith adjourned. Mr Caruthers the ninth member of the Committee was at the door, but did not come in. At the house Fillmore, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means reported a Bill making appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of Government for the first half year of 1843. read twice and referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. A great improvement on the hitherto customary bill providing only for the pay of members and the expenses of the two houses of Congress— The house then proceeded to the election of a chaplain and at the second trial the revd. F. T. Tiffany was chosen. A message was received from the President assigning his reasons for not having signed the two bills sent him at the close of the last Session of Congress, one repealing the section of the Act of 4. Septr. 1841. which suspended the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, and the other was the bill regulating the taking of evidence cases of contested elections— There was a desultory discussion upon sundry resolutions offered by different members. Briggs drove through an amendment of a temperance rule, substituting a prohibition of the sale within the capitol of intoxicating drinks, instead of spirituous liquors— The snarling debate on the disposal of the new testimony, on the contested election of David Levy the Jew Delegate from Florida, which was finally laid on the table— Adjourned at 3 O’Clock.— William Darby had been here this morning and borrowed the Deed from John P. Van Ness and his wife to me of the house and land on square 173—he wants it to make a map of the lot on which the house stands. Commander Paine was also here this morning—and Lewis Johnson, with a Letter for Mrs E. Gay, a sister of the late William Otis— I was threatened with rhumatism this Evening but was very late visited by Charles B. King, the Painter and Horatio Greenough— "

First at the Pension Office; to which I took all the papers concerning the pension claim of Winche Beedle which I had mislaid last Summer, and which in the general search of my papers here, I had now found— This Evening I received a Letter from the Commissioner of Pensions James L. Edwards, informing me that duplicates of Mrs Beedle’s papers had been received at the pension Office last September, and that she had obtained her pension— I went next to the bounty land-Office to enquire concerning a warrant issued by Thomas Jefferson in 1805, but was referred by Mr Gordon to the general Land Office. Then I called at the War Department and saw the Secretary Spencer— In the Official Register of Cadets of June 1842 of which Genl. Parker had given me a copy there were only 5 marked as from Massachusetts. By the regulations she was entitled to 12.— I wished to ascertain how many had been admitted last June, and if there was any deficiency in the number from Massachusetts to press urgently for the admission of young Hedge, next June. I found however that there were 7 admitted last June, giving to Massachusetts her full number even while she had 12 Congressional Districts; one of the 7. Darby, having been admitted at my special and earnest solicitation— Mr Spencer was exceedingly courteous in his demeanour, and enquired if I should be willing to receive an appointment as a visitor of the academy next Summer— I thanked him for the offer, and said I did not know how far I should have my time at my own disposal next Spring, and as I knew that office of visitor at the Academy was very anxiously coveted by many persons, I would not wish to stand in the way of any one who might otherwise obtain it. He read to me a Letter from an Officer at the Academy, stating that a Grandson of General Green residing in Rhode-Island, had claimed the property of two trophy pieces of cannon now at West Point, but which he insists were presented to General Green by a Resolution of Congress— They were taken at the surrender of Burgoyne, and they are excessively unwilling to let them go from West-Point.— Mr Spencer asked my advice what to do about it— I said if there was such a Resolution of Congress it must speak for itself; and the property must be in the General’s Executor or Administrator—and I should advise to purchas them of him, and pay very liberally for them. At the house several documents from the Executive departments were received, and the residue of the day was occupied in a hack debate in Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, Briggs in the Chair, on a motion of Gilmer to strike out a small appropriation for extra-Clerk hire. Adjourned at 3— Commander Paine of the Navy was here this evening. "

The assortment and filing and endorsement of my papers in monthly files of my Letters received from last March till September yet absorbs all my leisure time; and the unassorted papers are yet in so many heaps that I do but just begin to see my way clear but of the tangle— In the mean time, every day brings new trashy materials for large files of the present Session— I am however, the first time for six years relieved from the burden of unreceivable petitions.— The Speaker has decided that the mode of receiving petitions adopted upon a resolution offered by me at the last Session is yet in force; by this and the practice of the Speaker under it, every member not only introduces any and every petition that he pleases but has it referred to any Committee that he thinks appropriate— I had ten petitions which I should have presented if the States had been called; but after the speaker’s present decision, I made out the list; directed the committee to which each of them should be referred, and gave the list, after it was entered on the Journal of the house, to Mr Gales, to be published in the National Intelligencer, and it was published in the paper of this day.— The Speaker’s decision was, I believe unwarranted, and the chance is that it will terminate in an explosion.— At the house several resolutions were adopted without opposition, but G. W. Toland offered one of enquiry into the causes of the removal of Jonathan Roberts as Collector of the Customs at Philadelphia— The vote by yeas and nays was 96 to 81. not two thirds—and the resolution shared the fate of that of Botts, to ferret out the Letter of John C. Spencer to the people of New-York at the eve of their recent State election— The house then went into Committee of the whole on the state of the union upon the half year civil and diplomatic appropriation bill.— Aycrigg had moved to strike out an item of 50,000 dollars for continuing the Coast survey, under the superintendence of F. W. Hassler— Mallory chairman of a Committee of five raised about a year since for the purpose of turning Hassler out of his Office stated that a majority of the Committee, himself, Aycrigg and Cushing had come to the conclusion that Hassler was both physically and mentally incompetent to his office of superintendent of the work. Wise and Holmes, the minority of the Committee sharply denied this conclusion—Wise especially—at 3. the Committee rose— Adjourned— "

Mr Lewis Johnson brought me this morning two Letters to be forwarded to relatives of the late William Otis, and part inheritors of the remnant saved from the wreck of his Estate—one of them residing near Louisville Kentucky, and the other at New-Orleans. He had also a letter from John Otis of West Barnstable stating that there were two other women in the island of Cuba, married to Spaniards, one of them a widow, daughters of Nathaniel Otis one of William’s brothers.— and that the wife of Quincy Thaxter of Hingham was another daughter— This is a new exemplification of the manner in which our Laws scatter inheritances; and of the migratory character of our population— As I entered the Representative Hall I met Mr Henry Lunt who told me he should take the Cars this afternoon for his home at Dorchester. He has received about 400 dollars, the whole remainder of the sum deposited in the Treasury, due to the claimants of prize money in the squadron of Paul Jones and Landais in 1779.—but the sum admitted as due to Mr Lunt in right of his claim for his father, a Lieutenant on board of the Bon homme Richard is upwards of 4000 livres or 800 dollars, and he is now sharp set for the balance— He thinks of memorializing Congress for it, but will pause for the present. I met also before I reached my seat Mr Edward S. Jaynes,—Secretary of the American Bible Society, who invited me to attend a meeting of the Washington auxiliary Society of which Matthew St. Clair Clark, the Clerk of the house is present, this evening.— In the house Fillmore moved to go immediately to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the appropriation Bill— Giddings, chairman of the Committee of claims appealed in vain, as he had done yesterday to the rules which devote Fridays and Saturdays to the consideration of private business— The house went into Committee and the third day was spent in debating whether Hassler was or was not physically and mentally incompetent to his office of superintendent of the coast survey. Joseph R. Ingersoll in an hour speech nobly vindicated his character, and Reynolds of Illinois, as usual played the part of demagogue and buffoon— Gilmer at last changed the text of debate by moving to reduce the item from 50 to 20,000 dollars, on principles of retrenchment. Committee rose, and house adjourned at 3.— Evening visits from Dr Sewall, Mr Jaynes and Mr Edwards, a methodist preacher, T. Osgood, Richard D.

Sunday in Advent, and preached from Proverbs 9.12 “If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.”— Some 35 years ago I heard the Revd Peter Whitney at Quincy preach a sermon upon this text, and about ten years since I heard him read it again— From the first delivery of the text it has been impressed on my memory, though I have not one trace of recollection of the twice repeated sermon— What is thought? I believe I shall remember, as long as I shall be permitted to retain the memory of any thing that Mr Tiffany’s first sermon in the representative Hall, was upon this text, but of the Sermon itself I retain no more than I do of Mr Whitney’s discourse, twice heard and forgotten forever— What a lesson of Wisdom bedded in the motive of selfishness— Solomon speaks to his son—and bids him be wise for his own sake— And what is the meaning here of the word wise? the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom—but if thou scornest—scornest what?— The words scorn and scorn and scorner are used in the bible in a sense peculiar to itself— It is not merely unbelief but contemptuous disbelief—and it is a remarkable ingredient of all religious infidelity— It is never a quiet, but a perturbed state of mind—an angry passion— Thou alone shalt bear it—bear what? bear thy own scorn— It is a vexatious and harrassing state of mind, and a religious infidel is a self-tormentor— This appears to me to be the import of the text and its lesson is a precept of prudence— Why is it that Faith is enjoyment, and that scorn is wretchedness? My conclusion is than in the philosophy of Solomon, religious Faith is one of the natural wants of man, a source of enjoyment to himself, and that the wilful rejection of it is a calamity— The Hall was well filled, with an unusual number of members, and Mr Tiffany’s discourse appeared to give general satisfaction— After the service I paid visits, to Mr Henry Van Rensselaer at Galabrun’s; but he was unwell, and invisible. To the Mexican Minister General Almonte, his brother, Captain Chavere, and Lieutenant Gonzalez de la Vega, attachés to the legation, but none of them were at home—then to Mr and Mrs Daniel Webster, who received me, and to Mr and Mrs Roosevelt, who were at dinner— In the after dinner at St John’s church, Mr Hawley read evening prayers for the fourth Sunday in advent, and preached from Isaiah 11.9. [“]They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” This is a part of the lesson of the day— I received evening visits from Mr Hudson and Mr Saltonstall, and heavy morning and evening mails with morning and evening mails which absorbed the day.

Habersham, which happened at his residence in Georgia, on the 2d. of this month— This event had been published in a Savannah newspaper, as long as a week ago, but the fact was doubted, and not authenticated till last evening. Gamble’s panegyric was of the routine cast, delivered with some embarrassment and no genuine feeling— Habersham, was an amiable gentleman, of very moderate abilities a full blooded Georgia whig; with all the prejudices and passions of the South tempered with some of the sound principles of the federal school— The usual obituary resolutions were adopted, and the house adjourned— I never saw the decease of a member received by the house with so little manifestation of sensibility. Perhaps this was owing to the thrilling excitement of another cause— The United States brig Somers, Commander Alexander Slidell Mackenzie arrived last Wednesday at New-York from the Coast of Africa, having on her passage homeward suffered a mutiny, suppressed only by hanging at the yard arm three of its ringleaders, Midshipman Philip Spencer a son of the Secretary of War, with the Quartermaster and Boatswain of the vessel. The first account of this horrible tragedy, appeared in the National Intelligencer of this morning— Robert C. Winthrop, consulted me, about what he should do with a memorial which he has received, signed by a large number of the most respectable and distinguished Citizens of Boston, remonstrating against the unconstitutional and oppressive Laws of some of the Southern States, against free coloured citizens of Massachusetts— He proposed, according to the rule of the last Session which the Speaker has declared to be in force, to enter the memorial at the clerk’s table, and have it referred to the judiciary Committee for a report. And thereupon to raise a debate if possible. I approved this course— He said he had a copy of this Memorial addressed to the Senate with instructions to ask George Evans of Maine to present it—and not either of the Massachusetts Senators— A similar memorial, having at the last Session been entrusted to Mr Choate, and totally neglected— After the house adjourned I was detained nearly 3 hours by successive visitors coming to my seat— Among them, Commander Wyman, Dr Sutherland, Mr Babbit, Mr and Mrs Brockway, Mr and Mrs Morgan, Mr Clark the clerk of the house with the Revd. Mr Jaynes, J. J. Crittenden with a Mr and Mrs. Pindall from Kentucky and Garrett Davis, and many others.— I staid to make out my list of petitions, but could not finish the work.

Gregory of Sandlake New-York, had enclosed to me for him— Mr Richards knew him 25 years ago as a youth of 16. at Sandlake— He is a man of pure and benevolent heart of deep and stubborn moral principle, of weak judgment, and yet strong reasoning faculties, a composition not rare in the varieties of human character, and which usually results in a mischievous, restless turbulent marplot of his own comfort and that of his neighbours— How is it that the purity of abstract self-evident truth cannot be carried out in the realities of life— Mathematical truth requires an allowance of one third, for adaptation to physical nature—and the same Law is applicable to moral truth—and even to religious truth. I had also much conversation with Mr Richards, concerning his joint embassy with Ha li lio—more perplexing to Captain Tyler and his guard, than they have yet disclosed to either of the Ambassadors themselves.— I went to the General Post-Office, with a Letter from N. Munroe at West-Bradford pressing for an answer to an old application for a change of the name of the Post-Office there— Mr Wickliffe sent for the memorial, and after reading it, which he had evidently never done before, said it required a change of name of two Post-Offices, and should be attended to.— As to the Post-Office at South Dedham—the usual enquiries had been instituted— Reynolds of Illinois and another man were with him— Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs—present Adams, Cushing, Everett, Granger, Stuart, Shepperd, Holmes, Meriwether— Absent Caruthers.— The memorial of Nathaniel Cross, and his documents were referred to Cushing— That of John Randolph Clay to Stuart, and the Memorials concerning the French spoliations prior to 1800 to the chairman— The house refused to go into Committee of the whole on Fillmore’s appropriation bill, and took up Everett’s bill to repeal the bankrupt Law, which was debated till 3. when the house adjourned— Several amendments were proposed, and the previous question twice called; a considerable majority refused to sustain it the first time, and the house adjourned without taking the question at the second Two evening visitors—M’Ilheny a beggar of money; and Freeman a beggar of Office—in the Marine Corps.

Giddings then moved that the Committee be authorised to continue the employment of a clerk— This started a debate, which consumed the remnant of the hour.— The resolution finally passed with the addition of during the present Session, precluding the employment of the Clerk from the close of this Session till the meeting of the next Congress— The bankrupt act repeal bill was now taken up— Cushing who bustles upon every thing prevailed upon Pickens to withdraw his motion for the previous question, for him Cushing to propose an amendment, on failure of which he pledged himself to renew the motion for the previous question— Pickens accordingly withdrew his motion— Cushing then moved his amendment, to which Barnard moved again added his own— Cushing would not assent to this and so renewed Pickens’s motion for the previous question— But the house by tellers 66 to 94 refused a second to the previous question, and the whole debate was again opened— Then Underwood—Hopkins, Briggs, Cave Johnson, Wise, Charles Ingersoll, and Charles Brown, followed each other alternately for instantaneous repeal, and for reference to the judiciary Committee with various instructions, till Arnold closed with an hour speech, against the repeal altogether, and he launched out into a vehement and unmeasured invective upon the administration, especially upon the President and upon Daniel Webster; whose enquiry in his Faneuil Hall Speech, what will you do with me? he most unmercifully scourged. When he was crop’d by the expiration of his hour, Saltonstall took the floor and moved to adjourn; which was carried— Saltonstall said to me, I suppose they will expect I shall defend Webster; but I will not— I thought it would be as well leave that to Cushing— Franklin Whitney of New Bedford brought me a large budget of papers, with heavy complaint against the Commissioner of Patents for having issued interfering patents to him and to a man named Smith for an invention of making lard oil by means of Alcohol— There was a memorial to the Senate, with the answer of Mr Ellsworth to the Committee of the Senate to whom Whitney’s memorial was referred; and a Memorial to the President against Ellsworth—unanswered— All these papers Mr Whitney requested me to read, and to give my opinion upon them.

My dear wife was suddenly seized this morning immediately after breakfast with a chill, which compelled her to take again to her bed; and it proved to be a severe attack of Erisypelas— She was severely ill the whole day and evening without a symptom of promising improvement at night— Mr Connell came with a new agency in behalf of the old claimants against the Government of Denmark, of indemnity for spoliations— There was an old Danish claim against us for the capture of the brig Heinrick in the quasi war with France in 1799, prosecuted year after year from that time, counterbalanced by a still older claim of the United States against Denmark for certain British prizes taken by the squadron of Paul Jones, and Landais in 1779. carried into Norway, and there delivered up to their original English owners— Connell says that when the adjustment was made by the Government of Denmark some ten or twelve years since, of our claims for depredations from 1809 to 1811, the king of Denmark said that as part of the indemnities granted by him he transferred to the claimants all his claim on account of the Brig Heinrick— And Mr Connell comes now as the agent to recover this transferred claim— At the house John P. Kennedy pushed through all its stages a bill to change the name of a merchant ship from the West-Chester to the Atlantic— Fillmore moved a Resolution to cease debate upon the half year appropriation bill—at 2. O’Clock this day which was carried— He then moved to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union to take up the bill— Carried— Briggs took the Chair and Barker Burnell made an hour speech in glorification of Hassler and the coast survey— Burnell wanted more time—he had not sufficiently compressed his thoughts— Mallory took up the remaining short hour in reply, showering ridicule upon Hassler, and his encomiasts on the floor, and with a dirty but cunning malignity reading a foolish Letter of Hassler resentful at what he took for an insult by the Committee in sending Stone the engraver to inspect, and pronounce his opinion upon the work— Gilmer moved to strike out 50000, and insert 10,000 dollars which was carried by tellers— Then Meriwether moved to strike out the whole item of 50000 dollars— Also carried by tellers— An attempt was made to strike out the appropriation of 25000 dollars for the Boston Custom house but failed— The bill was reported to the house—the extrusion of the item for the coast survey confirmed by yeas and nays— The bill passed and the house at 1/4 past 3 adjourned.— David Lee called me out from my seat— He comes to report— Dr Murphy from Alexandria brought me a manuscript poem which he requested me to read and give my opinion of it.

A spell of cold weather came on so that I could not write early this morning, and that occasioned an arrearage— I slept in the upper chamber, and after making my fire was obliged to resort to reading by lamplight to employ the time till breakfast— I read a pamphlet, entitled Martial law, by a Kentuckian in four numbers of republication from a Kentucky Newspaper.— Its author is said to be a man named Nicholas of the old Virginian family of that name, and is or has been a judge in the State of Kentucky.— In the form of a Dissertation upon martial Law, it is a violent invective against General Jackson for declaring Martial Law at New-Orleans, which he contends was Treason against the United States.— Then against me for having assorted in the house of representatives that by the same martial law which Jackson declared at New-Orleans, he might have emancipated all the Slaves in Louisiana. The Senators Buchanan and Berrien came in for a share of his abuse— The Legislature of Rhode-Island—and the minority of the judiciary Committee of the House, in their report on the bill for refunding Jackson’s fine have also their share, but the motive at the bottom of it all is the panic terror at my exposure of the danger to Southern Slavery of eventual emancipation by martial law— Mr Leavitt who arrived the evening before last from Boston, called on me this morning, whereby I was delayed in reaching the house, about ten minutes. They were taking the yeas and nays on a motion to adjourn consequent upon a lack of a quorum precisely at 10.— The vote against adjournment was 109. to 7. but while the yeas and nays were in taking the quorum was formed. The house immediately took up the private Calendar, beginning with bills at the third reading of which 117. were passed without objection; every one to which objection was made being passed over.— The house then went into Committee of the whole Zadok Casey in the chair, when 30 more bills were reported to the house, without amendment, read a third time and passed. I went into the Senate, and gave Mr Bates a list of 7 the bills which had passed the house, requesting the attention of the Massachusetts Senators to them while before the Senate, which he promised to do— I had some conversation with Mr Buchanan about the Kentucky pamphlet which seemed to have startled him— In the house Stanly objected to the Bill in favour of Richard Rush— I prevailed upon him to withdraw his objection and the bill was passed. Charles J. Ingersoll came to my seat and thanked me in the name of Rush— I offered him my hand which he took— The Senate passed the half year appropriation bill. L. W. Andrews moved to adjourn over till Tuesday, and gave the yeas and nays to see who the demagogues were—the vote was 80 to 80. a tie— The Speaker decided for the adjournment— J. W. Baker, David Lee Child, and Greenough the Sculptor were here this Evening. "

The severity of the cold disables me, and the illness of my wife disheartens me for the regular pursuit of my occupations indispensable to keep the record of my life from lagging behind the current of Time— My fingers refuse to perform their office of writing, and I waste hours upon hours of my time in reading the daily trash of the newspapers This morning I read also the report of the Secretary of the Navy communicated to Congress with the Session Message of the President, and I found in it many sound and some mischievous suggestions— Mr Denison is a student at a theological institute, near Alexandria where they have a Post-Office the receipts at which more than pay its expenses, but which he says the Postmaster at Alexandria labours to get discontinued, because it pinches his emoluments and reduces them to less than 2000 dollars a year— He has been hitherto unsuccessful, but a bill to effect the purpose has now been hurried through the Senate without opposition, and seemingly without examination, and Mr Denison fears it will be driven through the house in the same manner, without reference to any Committee. I promised him if I should be in the house when it comes up to move its reference to the Committee of Post-Offices and Post-roads.— Lieutenant Wilkes came in great solicitude about his promotion— The act of the last Session of Congress limiting the number of Officers of the respective ranks, precludes the nomination till vacancies shall occur; but he said Mr Barnard thought an act of Congress might authorise the President to make a given number of extra nominations, supernumerary.— I promised to confer with Mr Barnard upon this expedient; but I thought as the Constitution gave to the President the power of nomination it might be doubted whether Congress could either enlarge or curtail it— Dr. M’Cauley brought me a Letter commendatory from Jeremiah Morrow the patriarch member of the house from Ohio. Mr M’Caulay has composed a work upon Patriotism, which he wishes me to read and to give my opinion of it— He read to me an index or table of contents, from which it appeared to be an elaborate treatise of speculative politics.— Mr Causten is the Agent of many claimants upon the French spoliations before 1800. He brought me several documents relating to those claims, and offered his assistance for urging them on the house— Fillmore and Giddings came as friendly visitors. Giddings told me that the majority of the Committee of claims were about to turn him out as chairman— Mr Rush came to thank me in behalf of his father, for prevailing on Stanly to withdraw his objection to the bill in his favour— Connell spent the Evening here "

Christmas—  The usual salutation of a merry Christmas met my ears this morning, only to aggravate the sharpness of the affliction with which I rose from the disturbed repose of the Night— The illness of my wife, is distressing beyond my power of expression under the violence of an attack of the Erisypelas just as she was seeming to be convalescent from a confinement of a full month to her chamber, tortured with a never ceasing nervous cough which it is scarcely credible that the human frame could survive.— It came on with sharp winters cold and Fahrenheit’s thermometer yesterday morning at 16— It had risen this morning to 24. and continued moderating all this day with a clearing sky and a bright Sun, yet without any abatement of the severity of the symptoms of my wife’s disease— The internal inflammation of the fire has been brought out in a preternatural swelling of the face and head, to an almost total obstruction of the paths of sound and closing of her eyes— I have passed through other Christmas days of deep affliction; but none of more suffering than this.— I attended public worship this morning at the Hall of the house of Representatives, where Mr Tustin the chaplain of the Senate preached from Luke 19.41. [“]And when he was come near, he beheld the city and wept over it. 42. Saying, if thou hadst known even thou, at least, in this thy day, the things, which belong unto thy peace! but now, they are hid from thine eyes.”— This immediately precedes the awful prophesy of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans— The English translation of the text is incorrect, and the text obviously ungrammatical. It should be read—Hadst thou but known &c.— Mr Tustin expatiated upon the dreadful destruction of Jerusalem as related by Josephus; and appeared to attach an exuberant importance to the incident that Jesus wept— The pathos of the discourse was of the melancholy cast, and not specially adapted to the joyous temper of the day.— But Mr Tustin is a presbyterian, and made not the slightest allusion to the nativity of the Saviour— After the service I called to see judge Cranch, who has been confined several days to his chamber with a threatened pleurisy; but is convalescent.— I met there the eldest daughter of Mr William Appleton of Quincy.— Here on a visit, and last from Baltimore, where she is keeping school.— After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley read the evening service for Christmas day, and instead of a Sermon, gave a brief exposition of the second lesson, being Titus 3–4. [“]But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared; not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghost,” and so to v. 7. inclusive.

I should have devoted this day to returning visits, but it is to me a waste of time so irksome, that I suffered the hours to slip away till it was too late, and my only excursion from home was a half hour’s walk before dinner— Hours were consumed in reading Newspapers— In the National Intelligencer of this morning, are Letters from J. J. Crittenden and Thomas Ewing, contradictory to a statement in the electioneering Letter of John C. Spencer, Secretary of War, published in last October— Franklin Whitney came and took back the papers he had left with me relating to his complaints against the Commissioner of Patents Henry L. Ellsworth— He asked my advice whether he should now take out a patent.— I thought this would estop him from contesting the interference of Smith’s patent, already obtained with his own— I thought he should call upon the President for a decision upon the complaint against the Commissioner, which he said he would do.— George Brown was here— He reports for the Boston Mercantile journal, and fawns upon Webster for a place— Our conversation was soon interrupted by Mr Hassler who came in with a printed pamphlet in defence of himself against the charges of Aycrigg and Mallory, that he is physically and mentally incompetent to his office of superintendent of the Coast Survey; he had also a copy of a Letter from him to Walter Forward, Secretary of the Treasury, proposing to give a set of his standard weights and measures to the British Government— And he began to talk, and talked, till Mrs Thornton came into to see Mrs Adams but immediately retired; Cranston and Stanly came in immediately after—visitors; but Hassler continued talking till I told him I would look over his papers and see him again.— Mr Walter R. Johnson was here this Evening, to enquire what is to be done about the Bill for the relief of Reynell Coates and of him, which passed the Senate at the last Session of Congress, and at the third reading in the House was on the 26th. of August laid on the table— It is for compensation for services under engagements to go with the exploring expedition from which they were discharged before the departure of the expedition. I am not exactly certain how to proceed in the present condition of the claim, but must enquire— I wrote to my Son, answering the enquiries of H. W.

I attended the meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs. present Adams, Cushing, Granger, Caruthers and Shepperd— Absent, Everett, Stuart, Meriwether and Holmes— The references from the house since the last meeting of the Committee were 3. two of which were now referred to Mr Stuart, and one to Mr Cushing— At the house, after the usual half hour of usual interloping petitions and resolutions, and notices of Bills, Wise presented a Resolution of the Legislature of Virginia, instructing their Senators, and requesting their Representatives to hurry through the passage of the bill to refund to General Jackson the fine imposed on him by judge Hall at New-Orleans in 1815— Wise struggled hard in presenting this Resolution to tack upon it a blazing speech; but it was choked off by objections from various quarters. Everett’s bankrupt law repeal came up, and Saltonstall delivered a grave eloquent hour speech against the repeal— Dawson of Louisiana followed him in a short speech on the same side; appropriate, decent, in humanized language, specially remarkable from the quarter whence it issued— But next came from Cushing one of the most extraordinary speeches ever delivered in that Hall— In obscure, ambiguous language, conveying ideas, veiled and shaded as if purposely intended to be disavowed if they should happen to be too well understood; but holding up the presidential power and especially the veto at auction between the two great parties which divide the Country— As he closed Thompson of Indiana took the floor— The Committee rose, and the house adjourned. Dr Hall had called me out from my seat to inform me, that Mr T. B. Johnson, had yesterday been struck again with a paralytic shock— I went after dinner to his house but could not see him— My wife had two severe ill turns this Evening; but Dr Thomas came and said she was better.

I had enclosed under cover to him, and despatched, Mr Johnson’s Letter to Mrs Gay, covering the order for 500 dollars of the Bank of the Bank of the Metropolis on the Merchants Bank at Boston. Lieutenant O. H. Pery called—he had left here last evening a recommendatory Letter from Mr Benjamin Gorham of Boston— Lieutenant Perry, a son of the deceased Commodore was one of the Officers of the exploring expedition commanded by Lieutenant Wilkes— The then Secretary of the Navy Paulding, allowed them extra pay, for that service; and now when after the lapse of four years they come home the accounting Officers of the Treasury, refuse to pass these payments to their credit, and deduct the amount of them from their regular pay— Lieutenant Perry represented the injustice and cruelty to me of this tenacity at the Treasury, which can be rectified only by Congress, and I promised him whatever aid I could give to that effect— Morning visits from Mr Leavitt, Mr Weld, and Mr Sedgwick— At the house after allowing an hour of the usual trashy intrusions upon the public busiess, I noted one of them—a Resolution offered by Thomas B. King, for the appointment of a select committee, to devise expedients for the construction of armed and iron steamers, to be used in peace for conveying the mails at home and abroad, and for the revenue service; and convertible into War-steamers in the event of War— I observed that a joint report was called for from the State and Navy Departments, on a proposition of the French Government on this subject, but King urged that he wanted only a Committee of enquiry; and I did not press an objection. This new passion of the South for the Navy grows more and more intense—all for the protection of Slavery and the internal Slave trade According to my notice given last Friday, I moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the French spoliation bill, but the house by yeas and nays 88 to 99 refused. Everett then called up his bill to repeal the bankrupt act— Thompson of Indiana made a spirited and eloquent hour Speech in reply to Cushing’s prostitution of yesterday— Everett then made a cutting speech, and closed by moving the previous question— Kennedy of Indiana intreated him to withdraw the motion, but he would not— But a large majority refused to second the motion. Kennedy made his hour speech of shallow vulgar crowing over the whigs—whereupon Wise took the floor and the house adjourned. Dr M’Caulay was here this Evening, and read to me in the true Scottish brogue his catechism of patriotism— "

                "text": "29. V:30. Thursday.  Isaac Hull Adams, and Walter Hellen watched last Night with Mr Thomas B. Johnson, whose attack of paralysis was so sudden, that he fell from his chair while sitting at his dinner table— He is however recovering from it apparently and is this day much better; but this is the third stroke which has fallen upon him within the last two years.— The severest symptoms of my wife’s disease have also somewhat abated, though she is yet so confined to her bed, that she can only be removed from one side of it to the other that it may be made— To aggravate our troubles at this crisis, Dr. Thomas himself has been taken down, with a disease of the heart—was unable to come out when Mr Johnson was seized, and left his bed to come here on Tuesday Evening when my wife had one of her alarming ill turns— He was yesterday and this morning better, but still looking far from well.— At the house, among the preliminary intrusions were 1. a Memorial from Pennsylvania, presented by James Cooper, praying for the creation of 200 millions of stock by Congress, upon a mortgage of the proceeds of the sales of the public Lands, for the payment of the debts of the States— W. Cost Johnson presented a similar Memorial, which was read, and moved the reference of them, and of others to a select Committee of nine. Cave Johnson moved to lay the whole subject on the table— This was rejected—and the select Committee was ordered 76. to 69. refusing even to Cave Johnson the yeas and nays.— Pickens presented Resolutions of the Legislature of South-Carolina calling on Congress to refund the fines imposed on Thomas Cooper and on Andrew Jackson— Everett presented a Memorial of 57 members of the Legislature of New-Hampshire, praying Congress to lay out the State in Congressional Districts— He moved that it be referred to the Committee of Elections and printed. Atherton made a speech against it and Campbell of South Carolina moved to lay it on the table; but Everetts motion prevailed. When the bill to repeal the bankrupt act was taken up, Wise with a flourish of trumpets made his hour speech, full of his usual portion of pompous bluster, and sneaking mystification.— he then asked for another hour, and actually moved a suspension of the hour rule to obtain it— And what with weazel malignity and dastardly whiggery there was a vote by yeas and nays of 100 to 80. to grant him the privilege— As he could not obtain two thirds, he failed in his insolent pretension. Fessenden of Maine closed the debate for the day, with an hour speech—sensible, spirited, modest, moderate, all but sufficiently caustic upon the abandoned profligacy of Cushing’s speech— Thomas F. Marshall took the floor, and the house adjourned— William Cost Johnson had come to my seat; and giving me a printed copy of his address to his constituents on the debts of the States, asked me to read it, and then say if I would be willing to serve on his select committee of 9. At present all my efforts are required to keep myself as much as possible aloof from all the debates in the house. "

Mr Tracy announced himself to me as a Citizen of Connecticut, a Grandson of the late General Artemas Ward of Massachusetts, and nephew of the present judge Ward of Boston— He is a merchant and came to urge the high expediency of measures to be adopted by Congress for the establishment of a regular mail communication with the coast of the South sea by the port of Chagres, and a land passage across the Isthmus of Panama— He said that the English had already such a regular mail communication establishment, and could reach Panama from Europe in 30 days, while our own squadron in the pacificc could not receive Letters or instructions from the Navy department in less than 5 months, by the way round Cape horn— I mentioned to him Mr Thomas B. King’s select Committee just appointed to whose consideration this subject properly belongs; and advised him to call upon Mr King and converse with him upon it—and with Mr Winthrop, a member of the Committee and also of the Committee of Commerce— Mr Connell came to request me to give a helping hand to push through the bill for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton, which he supposed would could up in the house this day; Doctor Mayo was also here to enquire if I had found his note to me with the copy of the confidential Letter from President Jackson to Fulton in December 1830. when he was Secretary of the Territory of Arkansas— I had not found the Letter— The Doctor thought he could from memory write it over again so that I should recognize it; and he particularly requested me to keep carefully the copy of the affidavit— At the house, Sprigg of Kentucky, made a case of breach of privilege out of a Letter from Stephen Pleasonton, 5th. auditor to the Speaker; contradicting certain statements of Sprigg in a speech, importing censure upon Pleasonton. This Letter of Pleasonton had been received by the Speaker, and by him presented to the house without knowing its contents, as an ordinary document from the Treasury department—laid on the table without reading, and ordered to be printed—and so entered upon the journal— Proffit made a similar complaint, of a like outrage upon him at the last Session— The house, was indignant at this intrusion of a subaltern executive Officer, and Meriwether offered a resolution, instructing the clerk to strike from the journal the reception and order to print Pleasonton’s Letter, and to return it to him adopted without opposition— James Cooper offered a third call upon the President, for information of malversation in the department of Indian Affairs—adopted— Weller moved to take up the bill to repeal the bankrupt act, but Giddings insisted upon the orders of the day and the house so decided by yeas and nays refused 112 to 60— Adjourned at 3.

                "text": "31. VI:15. Saturday.  The Ambassadors from the Sandwich Islands called this morning and took leave of me— Mr Richards read the official answer of the Secretary of State Daniel Webster, to their communication asking for the recognition of their Government as a Sovereign, independent State, and proposing to negotiate a commercial Treaty.— The answer, in language not very explicit, evades a direct acknowledgment, and declines the negotiation of a Treaty—but argues the right of the Sandwich Islands to be recognized as an independent State, and against the right of any European power to colonize, or take possession of them— Mr Richards said that Mr Webster had been more explicit with them in verbal conference and had told them that the whole subject of their transactions with him would be immediately communicated to Congress— Accordingly a Message from the President was received and presented by the Speaker to the House recommending an appropriation for maintaining a Consul at the Sandwich Islands; and another for a formal mission to China; which at the motion of Mr Cushing was ordered to be printed, and referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs.— The message, evidently Webster’s composition, contains an elaborate, and able argument for the recognition of the Sandwich Island Government, and for the mission to China— The remainder of the day till 3 was occupied with sundry motions to reconsider sundry private bills which had been passed— They were debated over again; but in every case the motion to reconsider was lost— At 3. the house adjourned over till Tuesday.— I went to the chamber of the committee of Foreign Affairs; locked myself in; and wrote the diary of yesterday, till 5— A convocation of chairs in the chamber indicated that a whig Caucus was to be held there, which upon enquiry I found, was to be at half past 6. this evening—but whether to doom the bankrupt act, or the Treaty, I suppose, next week will disclose.— I had been invited to dine at 5. with the Belgian Chargé d’Affaires Serruys who lives on the Capitol Hill; and instead of returning home at the adjournment of the house, had ordered Philip to come for me with the Carriage at 8 O’Clock, which he did— The company at the dinner, are named in the margin from Archer to White— I took Mr Kennedy home to his lodgings at Berths in 3d. Street— Hull’s friend Campbell was here this Evening—but I did not see him. "
