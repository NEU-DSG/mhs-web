                "text": "2. VI. Monday.  Morning absorbed in reading the Newspapers of the last Night’s Mail and the Globe of Saturday evening upon my table— It contains the speech of John C. Calhoun in the Senate of the United States last August in favour of advising and consenting to the ratification of the Webster and Ashburton Treaty— Calhoun is the High Priest of Moloch— The embodied Spirit of Slavery— He has resigned his Seat in the Senate of the United States to take effect from the close of the present Congress the 3d. of March next—and immediately upon the acceptance of his resignation by the Legislature of South-Carolina, they unanimously nominated him as a Candidate for election, as President of the United States for four years from the 4th. of March 1845. His speech is remarkable for one of those glaring, unblushing dare-devil inconsistencies, which as far as I know are peculiar to the doctrinal school of Slavery— He begins by a broad, explicit, unqualified declaration that he has always believed the claim of Maine upon the North-eastern boundary question just; and then proceeds with an elaborate argument to prove, that on that same identical boundary question the title of Great-Britain is clear, to more than she has ever claimed— On the subject of Slavery and the Slave-trade, the negotiation itself was a Scapinade— A struggle between the Plenipotentiaries to outwit each other, and to circumvent both countries by a slippery compromise between freedom and Slavery— Calhoun crows about his own success in imposing his own bastard Law of Nations upon the Senate by his preposterous Resolutions, and chuckles at Websters appealing to those Resolutions now after dodging from the duty of refuting and confounding them then— Calhoun concludes upon the whole to put up with the ticklish truce, patched up between the Treaty and the correspondence; and this was what in fact reconciled him to the ratification— There is a temperance in his manner obviously aiming to conciliate the Northern political sopranos who abhor slavery, and help to forge fetters for the Slave— My wife is still confined to her bed, and was more unwell this day than yesterday— There were however none the less of female visitors, who were well received by Mrs John Adams— Our late minister to France Lewis Cass, was among them; and told me that shortly before he left France he had a conversation with my old friend the king, concerning me, which he wished to tell me; and he was beginning to do so, when other visitors came up and interrupted him— He said he would call again some evening and tell me— They say the crowd at the President’s this day was unexampled— I did not go out. Walter Hellen dined with us. Campbell dined at the President’s and came in after dinner, and gave us some music with Isaac Hull.— Mr Greenough left with me a Memorial to Congress; and poor Hassler was raving about the treatment of him in the house— "

Mr Kurtz, and Mr Barcroft of Georgetown called on me this morning, and stated that they were members of the Society of Friends, and Mr Kurtz had a Letter from Philadelphia, recommending Mrs Lucretia Mott, who is desirous of obtaining the use of the Hall of the house of Representatives for a religious exercise—and without coming directly to the point, Mr Kurtz gave me to understand that it was desired that I should make the motion in the house; that she might have the use of the hall— I desired Mr Kurtz to say to Mrs Motte, that I remembered with much pleasure the hospitality which I had once, some years since enjoyed at her house, and the social intercours with which I had at other times been favoured by her husband, and other friends— That I should be happy to see her at my house, and if she desired it would make the motion in the house that she should have the use of the hall— But I observed to Mr Kurtz that Mrs Motte was known as a distinguished abolitionist of Slavery, that there was little difference between her opinions upon the subject of Slavery and mine: but he knew how obnoxious I was here both in and out of Congress for that very thing: and he would consider whether the application for the use of the hall would not be more likely to succeed if made by another member— I added that Speaker White told me last Saturday that application had been made to him, for the use of the hall by Mrs Motte, and that he had granted it— Mr Kurtz thought as I did that if there should be a necessity for asking the leave of the house for the use of the hall, it would be more likely to succeed if moved by some other member than by me—and said he would deliver faithfully my message to Mrs Motte. I attended the meeting of the Committee of foreign affairs—present Cushing, Everett, Granger, Caruthers, Stuart, Meriwether—absent Shepperd and Holmes— The Letter from the Secretary of State asking an appropriation of 20000 dollars, for running the boundary line under the Ashburton Treaty, was referred to Mr Cushing, and the President’s Message relating to the Sandwich Islands and China, were referred to the Chairman to report two bills— At the house, Slade moved a suspension of the 21st rule, for him to introduce a preamble and Resolution against the Slave trade in the District of Columbia. Suspension of the rule refused by yeas and nays 73 to 111. Morgan offered a Resolution to repeal a Florida negro-law—laid on the table 113 to 80— Bowne moved that the judiciary committee be instructed to report next Thursday at 12. O’Clock a given bill in totidem verbis—previous question lost. Bankrupt repeal bill. T. F. Marshall, withdraws from the field on the plea of ill health— Greenough here, and read his memorial. "

The weather yesterday morning was so mild that I rode to the capitol, without taking an outer garment—but in walking home I found it severely cold and as evening came on, I found the Catarrh upon me, I fear for the residue of the Winter— This morning I went to the general Post-Office, with a Letter of remonstrance froma minister at South Dedham, against the establishment of the Post-Office at that place, for which I had applied, with the Petition of Isaac Ellis and others and a Letter from William Ellis of Dedham— Mr Wickliffe promised to suspend the establishment of the Post-Office petitioned for, till further information shall be obtained— At the house Bowne’s Resolution to instruct the Committee on the judiciary to report a prescribed bill to refund General Jackson’s fine, with interest, to morrow, was debated through the morning hour, a motion to lay it on the table having been lost by yeas and nays—91 to 107 There is already a Bill on the Calendar, reported by the judiciary Committee at the last Session, and referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, but Bowne wants to signalize himself by the combustion of his zeal for the old hero. This has got to be a mere party foot-ball; and Bowne is attempting to carry the measure by storm.— And it is quite probable he will succeed— The speaker against all principle decided that Bowne’s motion to instruct the judiciary Committee to report another Bill, while there is already one reported by the same Committee now in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, was in order, has prostrated all rule upon the subject, and a succession of previous questions, stifling all discussion of the principles involved in the bill is probably the only way by which it can be carried— The expiration of the hour however, put off the decision again for this day; and Bowne took the floor again for the immediate repeal of the Bankrupt Law— He was followed by Meriwether—he by Pickens, and he by Proffit, with intermediate interruptions, and defiances of Cushing till past 3. O’Clock when Gordon took the floor, and the house adjourned— Cushing’s national venom was ransacked and held up to scorn by Meriwether and Pickens, notwithstanding his vehement disclaimers and challenges as for specifications— Proffit did all he could to help him out of his trouble, and piteously implored the house to allow Cushing an hour to explain the real meaning of his speech— But it was too bare-faced and flagrant; and if had an hour for explanation he would need a week to explain the explanation itself— Isaac Hull dined abroad— Walter Hellen was here and I had a long evening visit from Mr Sedgwick.

V:30— Thursday  My business encroaches on my Diary— At the house this morning John Campbell of South-Carolina, upon leave introduced a bill to suspend the operation of the second Section of the apportionment bill (the second which prescribes the elections by single districts) in all elections for the 28th. Congress— Campbell is the man who introduced that section into the bill itself. He now flinches from his own purpose— His bill was read twice—he wanted to pass it at once—but Barnard moved its reference to the Committee of elections—and Briggs that it should be printed, which was carried— Halsted introduced on leave and after notice the bill to regulate the taking of testimony in cases of contested elections and for other purposes, which passed both houses at the last Session, and was pocketed by the President— It was referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— W. W. Irwin moved a resolution instructing the judiciary committee to enquire into the expediency of repealing a section of one of the retrenchment acts of the last Session, prohibiting the publication by the Secretary of State of the Laws of Congress in Newspapers except in the city of Washington—adopted— Everett intreated the house to take up, and act upon his bankrupt act repeal bill— But Gwin, insisted upon taking up Bowne’s Resolution to instruct the judiciary Committee to report this day the Bill, first introduced into the Senate on the 10th. of last March by Dr Linn of Missouri— Barnard had moved an amendment, to instruct the Committee to report the facts and principles of the case; and Arnold had moved to refer the Resolution to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Gwin’s speech was a rancorous and malignant party invective upon the whigs for a sneaking desire to give the bill the go-by, and spurring them to take it into consideration: Cushing made a bombastic speech, about the glories of the victory of New-Orleans and in order to pass the bill in anticipation of the anniversary, which will be on Sunday he moved that all debate should cease on the bill in committee of the whole to-morrow at two O’Clock and the questions be taken on the bill and amendments— The Speaker decided the motion to be not in order; the bill in Committee of the whole not having been debated at all— I then rose and addressed the Speaker— Cushing who had moved the previous question claimed to hold the floor against me for another motion; but the Speaker told him he could not have the floor on two motions at once— I spoke about half an hour, till the expiration of the morning hour when Everett called for the orders of the day and his bankrupt act repeal bill— C. J. Ingersoll moved to go into Committee of the whole to get at the Jackson fine-bill lost by yeas and nays 100 to 106— Then followed on the bankrupt repeal bill an amusing snarl between Gordon and Bowne, New-York Democrats— M’Keon commenced a Speech, but the house soon adjourned— Mr Hackett, the comedian was here this Evening.

Friday—  It was the day before yesterday, that Mr Parker called on me, and announced himself as the agent of the bond holders of the debts of the several States of this Union; and he came here to solicit the interposition of the Government to enforce the punctuality of the States in the payment of their debts, interest and principal. And he asked my opinion as to the right of the bond holders to demand this interposition, and as to the duty of the federal government to extend it— I told him that I had no doubt on either point— That the bond holders have the right to demand, and the duty of the federal government to grant their interposition to compel the States to pay their honest debts— But that the President of the United States held a different opinion, and that he had nothing to do with the debts of the States— And that a vast majority of both houses of Congress held in this respect the same opinion as the President— That of course nothing will or can be done at present here, on the subject, and I therefore shall attempt nothing, having repeatedly expressed my opinion as to the result. He said he had written to the President to claim the interposition of the Government, and had not received an answer. That he would write to him again; and if he should receive no answer he would recommend to the bond holders to apply to their own Governments for their interposition— This morning Mr Lewis Johnson came to enquire, if I had examined certain papers relating to his administration of the estate of William Otis, and to his recovery of Otis’s claim against the Government, but I had not found time to read them; and I promised to read them as soon as possible— Mr Leavitt, who has been quite unwell came and borrowed a file of the Richmond Whig. He has published in the Emancipator only a part of my address at Braintree, and for omitting other parts of it alledged that he did not approve them— I asked him, what were the parts which he disapproved. He said the parts which had a political party aspect. I said they all had indirect reference to the Slavery questions— At the house Bowne’s resolution to instruct the judiciary committee, to report on yesterday, Linn’s old Senate bill, with Barnard’s amendment, and Arnold’s motion to refer the Resolution to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union were taken up— I moved an amendment to the Resolution, as a substitute for Barnard’s, and Arnold withdrew his motion. I spoke about half an hour when C. J. Ingersoll claimed the floor and the Speaker gave it to him— I claimed a whole hour upon my own motion but the Speaker refused it and I submitted— Ingersoll spoke about 30 minutes when the morning hour expired— He begged hard to be allowed to proceed but was not indulged— Nor could Everett get up the Bankrupt repeal bill. The rest of the day was devoted to private Bills— Campbell dined and spent the Evening with us. "

I sit up so late at Night reading the Newspapers and Letters, which come by the Mail from 9. to 10 in the evening, that I seldom reach my bed before midnight, which necessarily delays for two hours at least that of my rising— Sex horas somno—says Lord Coke, quoting from I know not whom—and that has been for more than forty years my rule of life—and the six hours are from ten at night to four in the morning— But the rule of life must be modified, by external causes, and by social relations with others— If I sit up till Midnight I cannot rise before six, and that irregularity leads to the laxity of the rule itself—to indulging in morning laziness encroaching upon the best hours of the day— Lieutenant Wilkes was here this morning—extremely solicitous about his promotion. A law of the last Session of Congress limits the number of Officers of each rank in the Navy that may be appointed, and that number is full— On the list of Lieutenants there are only four seniors to Mr Wilkes, and the appointment of him as a Commander would require the appointment of those also to the same rank— Mr Barnard has been preparing a resolution to repeal the restriction upon the number of officers, so as to allow the appointment of five more commanders than are now commissioned— And he and Mr Wilkes are urgent with me to offer the resolution, which I have consented to do; though I told Mr Barnard that I could seldom consent to offer a Resolution prepared by any other than myself. Mr John C. Clark a member of the house from Bainbridge, Chenango County, New-York called on me with a constituent of his, whose name escaped me, and whose only motive for coming was of curiosity to see me. At the house after the interloping intrusions one of which was Arnold’s attempt to get up his retrenchment bill N. 568. Bowne’s Resolution to instruct the judiciary Committee to report last Thursday Linn’s bill to refund with interest from March 1815 General Jackson’s fine, with my amendment yesterday proposed; came up, and Charles J. Ingersoll was delivered of his long treasured philippic upon me and glorification of himself and of Jackson— He spoke till the close of his hour; and then by a suspension of the rules, a half hour more, to vent the whole volume of his spleen upon me— When he closed, half a dozen members started up for the floor, which the Speaker gave to William O. Butler of Kentucky who was one of Jackson’s aids at New-Orleans. But the house passed to the consideration of private business till the adjournment— Dr Thomas was here this Evening, and Mr Hassler full of his grievances—and his hopes— Hull and Campbell dined at the Russian Minister Bodisco’s.

Sunday  My catarrhal cough is upon me, I fear for the rest of the winter— The weather is so warm and sultry that great part of this day passed without requiring a fire in my cabinet— But it was damp and showery like an April day I attended the morning public worship at the Hall of the House of Representatives, where a Baptist clergyman named Anderson, said to be a professor at a College in Maine, but now endeavouring to drum up a new baptist church in this city by preaching at the Apollo Hall, preached in the Speaker’s chair from 2. Corinthians 5.17. “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new.” The discourse was so confined to the first part of the verse; and it was the most ingenious exposition of the Christian doctrine of regeneration or the new birth. It was altogether argumentative and ingeniously metaphysical— It was evident that the preacher has been a close student of the school of Edwards. In handling his subject he laid down his positions—then stated the objections of the unbeliever; and answered them successively.— He presented a formal division of the motives to human action—external and internal,—and argued that regeneration or the new birth— As conclusive evidence of the efficacy of vicarious punishment and thereby of the atonement of Christ, he said the truth of any affirmative position, must be tested by its effects— Then he averred that whenever the process of regeneration took place, it was by a change of the influence of the external over the internal motives to action; which he exemplified by allusion to the treasury of Benedict Arnold, produced by the influence of the external motive of temptation over the inner man—and by supposing what would have been the effect of the same external motive if it had been applied to General Washington— The internal motive would have rejected the influence of the external one and so it is whenever by divine grace and the atonement of Christ the inner man is turned from sin to holiness.— Mr Anderson was introduced to me after the service by Mr Briggs— Neither of the chaplains of Congress was present. Joseph H. Adams dined with us— He and Campbell, and Richard D Cutts, and Walter Hellen were here all this Evening— Campbell is going off to-morrow morning for New-Orleans.— After dinner, I went to St John’s Church where the bell rung but there was no service; a shower of rain intervening— I called to see Mr T. B. Johnson, who is slowly reviving from a third shock of palsy, and looks all but dead— I then attended at the Presbyterian Church, where the new supplier of the pulpit preached to twenty hearers from 2. Corinthians 10.12: [“]For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves— But they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise.” "

Before going to the house this morning, I called on the Secretary of State at his Office, to confer with him upon the Message of the President relating to the Sandwich Islands and to China, referred by the House to the Committee of foreign Affairs, and by them to me— Mr Webster referred me to the correspondence between the Commissioners from the Sandwich Islands Richards and Haa-li-lio, and himself, for the views of the administration favourable to the recognition of the Government of those Islands—with which I concurred— I concurred also with the recommendations of the message, respecting the expediency of instituting a diplomatic mission to China; but enquired what was the amount of appropriation desired for both objects— Mr Webster thought a salaried Consul, like those maintained at the Barbary States would require about 3000 dollars and after some conversation on the probable details of expenditure he thought an appropriation of 40,000 dollars, would be adequate for the mission to China. He said he would send me an estimate in the course of the day; together with a despatch from Edward Everett containing some indications of the present views of the British Government concerning their intercourse with China— He accordingly sent me the papers in the course of the day, to the House— This conference delayed me so that the house had been a quarter of an hour in Session, when I reached my seat— I found new game was started. Cushing was vapouring against the Committee of Ways and Means, from which Fillmore the Chairman had reported an unanimous Resolution that the exchequer plan reported by the Secretary of the Treasury (Forward) at the last Session, and recommended by the President ought not to be adopted (Webster’s.) Cushing insisted that the Committee should have reported a positive measure— The minority of the Committee consisted of Atherton and Pickens, did report an amendment instructing the Committee to report a positive bill; in substance the sub treasury— Here was a perfect snarl, which brought out after Cushing, Everett, Arnold, Pickens, Wise W. Cost Johnson, Botts Fillmore, Granger, Joseph R. Ingersoll, Turney, John Campbell, Thomas F. Marshall, and at last Proffit, who only took the floor— Irwin moved to adjourn and refused to withdraw it merely to take the question on printing the reports— Fillmore called the yeas and nays on the adjournment, and Irwin finding the vote going against him, withdrew his motion till the question to print was taken and carried. Botts had given notice that he would to-morrow move his charges for the impeachment of President Tyler. When Marshall’s speech was cut off by the expiration of his hour he said he would take it up again, upon any other question that may come before the house, and make his whole speech right through. Hull went to a Ball at Major Kearney’s. "

Tuesday  A person by the name of Hoover came and enquired if I had received some time last Summer a sample of ink from his brother with a request that I would use it, and give under my hand a certificate of its superior qualities— I told him I had received a box with twelve bottles of ink, part I believe black and part red, with a Letter from Mr. Hoover requesting my acceptance of the ink, and a certificate of its good properties.— I had used one bottle of the black ink, and had a second ready to be opened— It was very good ink; though rather pale at the first writing. I was well satisfied with it for use; but I never gave recommendatory certificates of articles for sale, and would prefer paying for the bottles of ink that I have taken, and to return the box with the rest— He said if I made it a rule to give no certificates, he could not expect me to make an exception for him, and left me, expecting that he will send for the box— Mr Sweetser consul at Guayaquil, but who has a claim for diplomatic services, and going to Quito and exchanging the ratifications of a Treaty with the Republic of Equador called this morning to urge the speedy decision upon his claim by the Committee of foreign Affairs, to whom it has been referred— I attended the Meeting of that Committee—present Cushing, Stuart, Meriwether, Caruthers and Holmes— Absent Everett, Granger and Shepperd— Cushing had prepared a Bill making appropriations for carrying into execution the Ashburton Treaty— This was discussed— Meriwether thought an additional section was necessary, appropriation of a squadron of eighty guns to be kept for five years on the coast of Africa for the suppression of the Slave trade— I concurred in this opinion which was partially discussed, and postponed for further consideration— So was the claim of Mr Sweetser after some examination of its merits— So was my report of my conference with Mr Webster on the Chinese, and Sandwich Islands concerns— At the House, John M. Botts moved a select Committee of 9, with power to send for persons and papers, to report upon nine specific charges of misdemeanours against John Tyler, Vice-President of the United States acting as President, with a view to his impeachment.— After a good deal of skirmish fighting, this motion was rejected by yeas and nays 83 to. I had strongly urged Botts against this movement, and positively refused to support him in it or to serve upon his Committee if appointed— I voted however for the appointment of a Committee to examine and report upon his charges— After this matter was disposed of, Proffit made his hour speech of scolding and railing at the whigs about the exchequer plan—and the house adjourned.

Mr John Spear Smith, the son of the late General Samuel Smith of Baltimore, and heretofore one of the attachés to the legation, when I was minister at St. Petersburg, was here this morning. I had not seen him for many years, and since our residence in Russia, time has scarified his face with wrinkles. He is now here in attendance upon the proceedings of Congress relating to the claims on France prior to 1800— I spent four hours of last evening in a running perusal of the trial of James H Peck, judge of the U.S. District Court in Missouri, for punishing by imprisonment and suspension from practice a Lawyer named Luke Edward Lawless for a contempt, by publishing in a newspaper a critical review of an opinion delivered by the judge and also published in a newspaper— I found in it a uniform series of opinions as to the power of judicial courts to punish for contempt, directly in the face of position impudently assumed by Charles J. Ingersoll, that judicial Courts have no lawful power to punish for contempt— At the house Mr John Pope, chairman of the Committee on the Territories moved, and after some discussion carried a resolution to devote the 2d. 3d. and 4th. of February, to the consideration of business relating to the Territories— The Committees were called, and the Jackson Fine was taken up— William O. Butler of Kentucky, one of Jackson’s aids, in the New-Orleans campaign, and perhaps the most distinguished member from Kentucky now in the house, discoursed nearly an hour and a half in glorification of Jackson, and in malignant Slander upon me— When the morning hour closed the Speaker’s hammer fell, but Mr Butler wanted more time and the Speaker said that by general consent he might have it— No objection was made and he went on till he had emitted all his venom upon me When I spoke the other day, I was allowed only two half hours, upon two totally distinct questions, and when I claimed a full hour upon the amendment proposed by myself it was denied— Winthrop insisted on my right; but it was of no avail— But Ingersoll and Butler have been allowed each an extra half an hour for the pleasure of reviling me— After Butler closed Hiram Hunt of New-York took the floor; but the morning hour was gone; and the report of the Committee of ways and means against Tyler and Webster’s exchequer was taken up— Underwood made an hour speech, chiefly in defence of H. Clay against an insidious, and base insinuated charge against him in Proffit’s speech of yesterday— Everett made a speech and moved the previous question; but the house adjourned— I dined at Mr Webster’s with a diplomatic party of 18. And attended an Evening party at B. O. Tayloe’s. "

Thursday  I give the list of the company at Mr Webster’s dinner party yesterday, chiefly for the sake of preserving the names of the diplomatic agents now here— But neither the British Minister Fox nor the French Pageot nor the Austrian Hultzman was there— Van Zandt has just arrived as Chargé d’Affaires from Texas— Almonte is of a mixed breed of Spaniard and Indian, of which his face is highly characteristic— General Cass came in last evening after dinner at Mr Websters, and told me what he had spoken of at my house on the second of this month— General Cass said that shortly before he left France, the king Louis Philippe asked him what in nature had got into Mr Adams, with whom he recollected to have formed a very pleasing acquaintance in England; and whom he had ever since considered as a friend. Mr Cass said he was surprized, and asked the king to what he alluded— Why—says Louis Phillipe—he denies my title— The General said he knew not what to say in reply— I told him that in a lecture delivered before a literary Society, speaking of the dangerous and convulsed condition of Europe, and referring to France, I said that its king held his crown neither by the monarchical title of hereditary succession, nor by the republican title of popular election. but I spoke it as of a historical fact without evil intention to him, and without imagining that it would have been remembered by any one the next day— Well, said Mr Cass—but it was true.— This morning Dr Mayo called here with a couple of pamphlets, one of which was the War in Texas, and of which he asked me if I knew the author, and I told him it was the late Benjamin Lundy. The other was a publication of the recent correspondence between this, and the Mexican Government—published by the Mexican Minister here.— At the house, Giddings chairman of the Committee of Claims, reported without amendment a joint Resolution from the Senate to establish a new rule, to reject in future all claims against which reports have been made at former Sessions. A debate sprung up which absorbed the morning hour, and closed by a motion of Hopkins to lay the Resolution on the table—lost by yeas and nays 86 to 129. Cushing moved to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union to take up the exchequer bill, lost by yeas and nays 101 to 104— Holmes to take up the French claim bill—lost without a count— Bankrupt repeal bill— M’Keon finished a flat speech and Rayner gave a deadly blast of an hour.

John Young said he wished to speak upon the bill, and the house adjourned— The Count de Menou called on me this evening, and as agent for the Renaut claim, put into my hands sundry papers; convinced me that the claim was just and solicited my assistance which I promised. Menou himself is a worthy and honourable man, under beclouded fortune, and whom it would delight me to be able to serve— Mr Borden came with Jonathan Hodges, who brought with him a recommendatory Letter from Mr Hodges, heretofore a Member of the House from Bristol District.

Bell sued the white man, named Rhodes in the circuit Court for his freedom— The trial was procrastinated about 18 months, till last August. on the 20th. of August he was adjudged on the special verdict of a white jury to be free from this sentence. Rhodes appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court now in Session— Mr Hoban and Mr Wallach have been Bell’s lawyers in the Circuit Court, and he said he had been advised to apply to me to assist him in the Supreme Court— I promised to do for him what I could— Mr Hodges came with a model of his invention to be deposited in the Patent Office— It is a metallic bed for the end of the axEltreee of a railway locomotive; but he did not explain to me it operation or its use— But he renewed the request, which he, and Mr Borden for him had made last evening that I would furnish him with a Letter to some person in England who might help him in his pursuit. I accordingly wrote, and in the evening sent to his lodging at the Washington Hotel a Letter of introduction to Edward Everett. On my way to the Capitol, I stop’d at the general Post-Office and delivered to the second Assistant post-master general Bryan a packet sealed, addressed to him and enclosed to me by William Ellis of Dedham.

Hunt made a silly hour speech upon Bowne’s fine refunding resolution and my amendment. The bill for the relief of the heirs of Philip Renaut was at the request of Mr Moore of Louisiana postponed till next Friday as was also desired by me— A bill for the relief of the inhabitants of West Florida was opposed in a spirited Speech by Mr Giddings, and supported with so much overbearing insolence by Black of Georgia, reinforced by the squeaking of the Jew Delegate from Florida Levy, that I was provoked to speak, and moved to adjourn which was carried without opposition, though Levy had moved the previous question.

                "text": "15. IV:30. Sunday  I attended public worship in the hall of the house of representatives where Mr Tustin, the chaplain of the Senate preached from Daniel 5.27. “TEKEL. Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.” This is a formidable text for a preacher to manage—and especially for a chaplain to a house of Congress. It is in itself the key to a discourse of keen and searching reproof to the auditory— It is the solemn duty of a Christian clergyman to administer reproof to his hearers; and it is the duty of the hearers to listen to reproof without taking offence— This is the great practical obstacle to the faithful and useful discharge of the preacher’s duty. If he probes the sinner to the soul, he kindles hatred against himself; and loses his hold upon the conscience. If he forbears he neglects his holiest duty and betrays the cause of his master.— When Louis 14. told Massillon, that he had often admired the splendid eloquence of other preachers but that he always made him discontented with himself, he testified the admirable address, as well as the rare virtue of the bishop of Clermont. Read his Petit Carême preached before Louis 15 in his childhood, and during the regency of the profligate duke of Orleans, and you will see the consummate art with which the pulpit orator had reproved without offending; and made the vain glorious royal sinner ashamed of himself without incurring his displeasure— Mr Tustin told us all that we had been weighed in the balances and found wanting—but this is reproach and not reproof like the wild goose Satire of Jaques, flying unclaimed of any man. After the morning service I called at M’Daniels to visit Briggs, Winthrop and Hudson who lodge there, but neither of whom was at home. I went next to Clements’s and visited Isaac E. Holmes, member of the house from Charleston South-Carolina, specially elected to Congress as a wrangler against me, but has always treated me with marked civility— I found with him Walter Coles an icy member from Virginia, and George M’Duffie, recently arrived, a Senator from South-Carolina, in the place of Preston resigned— He looks feeble and emaciated, but of the same impenetrable stuff as of old— My wife this day was able to come down to dinner—the first time since she returned here from Quincy. After dinner at St. John’s church prayers for the second Sunday after Epiphany were read by Mr Stringfellow, rector of Trinity church in this city, and a sermon was preached by Mr Slaughter of Alexandria, from 2. Corinthians 5.17. “If any man be in Christ he is a new creature,” the same text, preached from by Mr Anderson last Sunday morning at the Capitol— We had long evening visits from a young man named Smith—a friend of Isaac Hull, from Mr Benjamin Rush, and from John Connell.

Monday  Mr Benjamin Rush was here this morning— Somewhat apprehensive of the fate in the Senate of the bill for the relief of his father, which has passed the house— I promised to speak to one of the Senators in his behalf— I went to the Senate chamber for that purpose on Saturday; but they were not in Session— I went again this day, but they had adjourned. Mr. Sedgwick came again this morning; to urge me on to call up the French claims bill; and to talk generally upon the political topics of the day— He listens with much attention to what I say, and tempts me to talk too much—all from vanity. At the house it was the day for offering Resolutions, and no sooner did the Speaker name the State of Maine than Clifford started with a Resolution to instruct the Committee on the judiciary, to report forthwith the following bill— Be it enacted &c that the Bankrupt act &c, be and the same is hereby repealed— There was a bill already in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union reported by the same judiciary Committee— Nothing can be more explicit than the rule of the house than forbids this duplication of bills on the same subject— Objection was made by Barnard to the reception of Clifford’s resolution—and the rule was cited; but the Speaker decided that Clifford was in order, and he moved the previous question.— This petty by-play to overreach one another, by a war of posts on points of order which would disgrace a court of pie-powder, is the ordinary practice of all the leading members of the house—a motion was made to lay Clifford’s resolution on the table—lost by yeas and nays—81 to 110. The motion for the previous question was seconded by tellers 90 to 79. and carried by yeas and nays 116 to 88. The Resolution itself was carried 128 to 78. Then Barnard referred to the rule of the house that Committees cannot sit while the house is in Session, without a special order of leave— Wise moved a resolution that the committee have leave to sit during the Session of the house, to bring in the bill— Barnard objected that this motion was not in order, and the speaker so decided— Wise appealed and his appeal was laid on the table 104 to 91. The Speaker called Maine again for Resolutions and Lowell offered again the Resolution which had slumped in the hand of Wise—motion to lay it on the table lost by yeas and nays 87 to 105.— Main question ordered 116 to 88. Resolution carried 128 to 78— Barnard went out and soon returned— No Quorum of the Committee had been formed, and no bill was reported— Fessenden for Toland moved a resolution of enquiry of the Secretary of the Treasury, concerning the removal of Jonathan Roberts as Collector of the Customs at Philadelphia—yeas and nays 103 to 76. not two thirds Resolution lost. Tillinghast offered a proviso to the bankrupt repeal bill which was finally carried— In the evening James Mott and is wife Lucretia were here; and after them Charles A King the painter, infatuated with Mesmerism.

The hours of the morning lamp were consumed in commencing the preparation of a report of the Committee of foreign affairs upon the Message relating to the Sandwich Islands, and China— I could not finish it; and feel in its composition the decay of my faculties more than in any thing that I ever before attempted— Joseph Blunt came this morning, and gave me a small volume of his Speeches, Reviews and Reports, which he had just published— Blunt is a man of fine talents and excellent principles, blunted by an over-familiarity of deportment, and a good-natured over-estimate of himself—repulsive because appulsive. Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs— I was tardy, 15 minutes— Present Adams, Cushing, Everett, Granger, Stuart, Meriwether, Shepperd, Caruthers and Holmes.—the whole Committee— I read the Letter from Mr Webster to me, proposing the appropriation, and the part of the despatch from Edward Everett of 29. November 1842. relating to China— I mentioned that I had begun but not finished a report, and would read to them what I had written or ask them for time till the next meeting to finish it— They took up Cushing’s bill of appropriations, for carrying into execution the Ashburton Treaty— He wished, and had expressed the wish to me in a conversation at my seat last Saturday after the adjournment of the house, to present an argumentative report in defence of the Treaty, and particularly of the Article stipulating for the squadron of 80 guns to be kept on the coast of Africa— There was some objection in committee to his making this report, because it must be debatable in Committee and must occasion delay— Meriwether’s motion to add a Section with a specific appropriation for the African Squadron was rejected, but Everett renewed it in another form—further consideration postponed to the next meeting, fixed for Thursday morning the 19th. at 11. At the house, I have no room for details, but nearly the whole day was consumed like yesterday in trapping with yeas and nays for the repeal of the bankrupt act— The first and second bills were so jumbled together that inextricable confusion was the result— T. F. Marshall instead of making a speech moved the previous question upon Everett’s bill with Cushing’s amendment which were at last carried by yeas and nays 140 to 71. after several intermediate votes. The house then went into committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the chair, and took up the army appropriation bill— Committee soon rose, and the house adjourned. Revd Mr Danforth—Count de Menou—Messrs. Murray and Van Wagenen were here. "

Mr Danforth’s visit to me yesterday was to urge me with great importunity to deliver a Lecture at Alexandria which I assured him would be absolutely impossible during the Session of Congress— He still teized me with inquiries whether I would deliver one in March or April—to which I could only promise an answer when the time should come— The object is to raise a hundred dollars contribution to pay the debt of a beggarly presbyterian church, which he has spurred them on to build without means to pay for it—just as he did here— This morning Alpheus Packard, and his brother Joseph came with a letter of introduction, from their father my old classmate Hezekiah Packard now 81. years of age. His eldest Son, Alpheus with whom he lives, is a professor of Rhetoric Oratory and classical literature at Bowdoin College, comes now on a visit to his brother Joseph the youngest son at the theological seminary near Alexandria— He has seven children living.— Mrcomes from the territory of Ioway, about which he has written a book— He is now going to Boston, and thence to England; and he wants a Letter of introduction to Edward Everett— He sent me his book upon Ioway last fall. I received it in Quincy; but had not time to read it— I promised him a Letter to my Son at Boston.— At the house I moved to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union with a view to call up the bill for providing indemnity for the sufferers by French spoliations, before 1801.— The house went into Committee, but twice refused to take up my French claims bill, both times by tellers first 78 to 80 and the second time 68 to 78.— The army appropriation bill was then taken up, and the nibblers of Economists began upon it— I heard them till I was tired out, and then went into the Senate chamber and spoke to Mr Huntington asking his favour to the bills for the relief of Richard Rush and of Joseph Holmes— Huntington said that in the case of Holmes there was a shipping paper wanted, and said he would speak in behalf of Mr Rush to the Senator from North-Carolina, Graham, with whom the bill labours.— I found Mr Choate speaking with great power in answer to one of T. H. Benton’s numberless pugnacious attacks upon the Ashburton Treaty— I heard Choate for about half an hour, and he had been speaking an hour and a half before— When I returned to the representative hall I found the house had adjourned— Evening visits from Joseph Blunt, and from Messrs. Murray and van Wagenen, much disappointed at the failure of the attempts to get up the french claims bill— I was occupied much of the Evening in examining the Kentuckian Samuel Smith Nicholas upon martial Law.

I finished this morning the report from the Committee of Foreign Affairs, to accompany two bills, in compliance with the Message of the President of the United States, relating to the Sandwich Islands and China— Then attended the meeting of the Committee— Present Adams, Cushing, Everett, Granger, Stuart, Meriwether, Caruthers, Holmes— Absent Shepherd— Cushing’s bill to carry into execution the Ashburton Treaty was amended by an additional section requiring that the cost of the stipulated squadron, on the coast of Africa, should be paid from the annual naval appropriations— By a report from the Secretary of the Navy, in answer to a Resolution of the Senate his estimate of the cost of the African Squadron is 440000 dollars for the vessels 40000 dollars for repairs, wear and tear and 240000 dollars a year for maintaining it— Half a million of first cost, and 300000 dollars a year for the five years stipulated will fall short of the real cost— Mr Cushing repeated his wish to prepare a report in justification of the Treaty with the bill— There was some reluctance in the Committee; from apprehension of delay and perhaps final dissent of a majority of the Committee—but I urged the fair claim of the Treaty to be defended by a report, and Mr Cushing was authorised to prepare one— I read my report on the Sandwich island and China Message, and was authorised to present it to the house, with an amendment suggested by Mr Everett.— The bills are not yet prepared.— The Committee adjourned to next Tuesday. In the house after the usual quantity of miscellaneous trifles, Cushing in the process of the call of the Committees, reported the bill of appropriations for carrying into execution the Ashburton Treaty, and bustled about with explanations speech, like to attract notice.— The bill was referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— The Jackson-fine Resolution offered by Bowne, with Barnard’s amendment and mine (the immediate question in debate[)] came up next— Hiram P. Hunt finished his speech, and dealing this day only with C. J. Ingersoll’s preposterous pretension that the Courts of Law have no power to punish summarily for contempt, completely demolished it— The morning hour expired and Botts took the floor for the next debatable day— And now came Proffit’s motion to reconsider the repeal of the bankrupt Law, made to give Cushing an hour for reply— He took the hour, and made his case worse by his use of the hour— He assailed furiously Fessenden, and Thompson of Indiana, who had severely handled him— Fessended replied gently, but keenly— Thompson agonized to get the floor but failed— Garrett Davis and Thomas F. Marshall followed, each an hour till near 5. O’Clock. The Count de Menou was here this evening. "

Friday  Isaac Hull Adams, and Walter Hellen went yesterday to Alexandria, and returned this morning— Mr Connell was here, very urgent with me, to get the house to take up the bill for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton— He said there was but one bill on the calendar before it; and Mr Cowen of the committee of claims who had charge of it was willing to postpone it, and take that up— I was pledge to take part in the debate on them both, and also on a bill for the relief of the inhabitants of West Florida and on that for the relief of the heirs of Philip Renaut, which superseded both the others.— John Spear Smith was again here, lamenting that the house, after going into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union at my motion, with notice that my object was to take up the French claims bill twice refused to take it up— He told me that Samuel Smith Nicholas, the Kentuckian author of the pamphlet on martial Law—was a relation of his—(maternal first cousin) He said he had written to him of his principles about martial Law, but he did not agree with him; and mentioned that his father in the defence of Baltimore in 1814 had burnt sundry houses of individuals— At the house, on the call for Reports from Committees Robert C. Winthrop from the Committee of commerce presented a report on the memorial of Benjamin rich andothers of Boston, remonstrating against the practise of imprisoning coloured mariners in South-Carolina, and other Southern States, which report he said was agreed by seven out of the nine members of the Committee— That of the two others Mr Rayner of North Carolina had prepared a minority report, and the chairman of the Committee John P. Kennedy, dissenting from both reports would probably present his views separately— Winthrop’s report closed with several resolutions which were read. He moved that both reports be printed and laid on the table for consideration hereafter, and to avoid debate called for the previous question. The Slave representation were instantly in a flame— Rayner’s report closed with a Resolution that the Committee be discharged from the further consideration of the subject— Kennedy moved that 5000 copies of both reports be printed. Jacob Thompson objected and Kennedy withdrew his motion but Rayner himself renewed it— By the rule of the house, the motion must lie over one day— Black of Georgia objected to the printing of the majority report at all, and moved to lay the motion to print on the table—lost by yeas and natys 72 to 114— Fillmore moved to cease debate and take the question on the army appropriation bill to-morrow at 2. O’Clock lost— Private bills till the adjournment. Franklin Whitney here— Evening and supper at John L. Kerr’s. "

Ellsworth Commissioner of Patents for official misconduct, and asking for the appointment of a select committee with power to send for persons and papers to investigate the charge— I told him that I would read the petition, and if he insisted on it would present it, but if a Committee should be appointed it would be impossible for me to serve upon it— The party at Mr Kerr’s last evening was of Gentlemen—members of Congress and others— Mrs Kerr was there—and Mrs Greenough the sculptor’s wife—no other Lady.— I was none the better this morning for the supper of last evening— Major Fauntleroy of the second regiment of dragoons came this morning, most urgently to remonstrate against the conversion of that regiment into a dismounted rifle regiment which by the act of the last Session of Congress is to take effect on the next 4th. of March. This was one of the Southern compromises screwed by the Senate upon the house, which had directed the regiment to be disbanded; and there is now before the house a resolution moved by Gwin of Mississippi, to repeal the provision for dismounting the regiment— The major says that if they are to be dismounted they had better be disbanded at once— He gave me much useful information concerning the character of that western population, of which the yankee nation do not even dream—but it thoroughly convinces me that the regiment ought to be disbanded; and that it will not even be dismounted— At the house, on the call for reports from Committees, several of them were upon subjects of deep interest, but of which little notice was taken owing to the transcendent influence of the Slave representation— Cave Johnson with the aid of Gilmer, and of Granger drove through a bill prohibiting any extra allowance to any public officer for any service whatever. I spoke against it, and so did Joseph R. Ingersoll and Holmes, but it was carried by yeas and nays 151 to 15. Arnold moved a reconsideration and struggled hard to get in his bill 548 by way of amendment, but failed— Rayner’s motion to print 5000 extra copies of the two reports from the committee of commerce on the imprisonment of Southern coloured Seamen in South-Carolina was called up by me, and adopted without opposition: Rayner himself was not in the house— The bill for the relief of the inhabitants of West Florida came up— I spoke about half an hour against it and concluded by moving to lay it on the table. Levy, the delegate asked me to withdraw the motion, to give him the opportunity of reply— I withdrew the motion and the house adjourned.

Cushing and Irwin— Mr Bodisco told me that he made it a rule to give four dinners of 36 every year, and two smaller of 18. This morning at the hall of the house of Representatives Mr Tiffany read a small portion of the episcopal morning service, without the litany or any part of the communion—no singing— He read the chapter from the old Testament of the first lesson, and preached a very short Sermon, from Hebrews 12.22 “But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels, 23. To the general Assembly of the church of the first born, which are written in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of just men made perfect.” The whole service was performed in less than an hour, and Mr Tiffany’s exposition of his text was very superficial— In commenting upon any passage in the Scriptures, taken for a text, it seems to me that the preacher should consider it, in its relations with the context, and the general scope of the whole chapter from which it is selected— This chapter for example contains a most solemn and fervid exhortation to steadfastness, endurance, patience, perseverance, under every persecution and every affliction— It appeals to the example of patient endurance given by the saviour himself—he likens the afflictions of the faithful to the chastisement of an affectionate parent to this child, and in exquisitely beautiful imagery paints the Christian in his pilgrimage as arriving, not at the terrific mountain of the wilderness Sinai, whence amid terrific thunder and lightening, and the sound of the trumpet, which mortal man could not abide, but at the mild and cheering foot of mount Sion, the permanent immovable seat of the holy temple, in the city of Jerusalem—then passing on to heaven, to the innumerable company of angels, to God, to the Spirits of just men made perfect—and afterwards to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant—what a lesson of more than Roman fortitude!— After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read the prayers for the third evening after the Epiphany, and preached from Isaiah 60.19. “The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.”— I had heard Mr Hawley on this text before— After Church I went over to see Mr T. B. Johnson’s to see him; but Mrs Smith who came to the door told me that he was asleep, and I declined having him waked— Mr Richard Rush took tea, and spent the evening with me; and had long conversation with me, on the Oregon territory, and T. H. Benton’s speeches. "

Ellsworth Commissioner of patents as he belongs to New-Bedford in Mr Burnell’s district. I advised him to get him to present it, and have it referred to the committee on the judiciary— He said he had wished me to present it and have it referred to a select Committee, of which I should be chairman; but I told him that would be impossible; but if Mr Burnell should decline to present his petition, I would present it— He is bitterly resentful against the commissioner of patents Ellsworth, and believes him to have been in this case venally corrupt, which I cannot.— I attended the meeting of the Committee of foreign affairs— Present Adams, Granger, Stuart, Caruthers, Shepherd, Meriwether—and absent Cushing, Everett and Holmes— I presented two Bills of appropriation, one for the compensation of a Consul or Commissioner to the Hawaian or Sandwich Islands—3000 dollars; and the other of 40000 dollars, to enable the President of the United States to establish the future commercial relations of the United States with China, on terms of equal reciprocity— I was authorised by the unanimous vote of the members present to report to the house the two bills as I had prepared them, which I did on the call of the Committee for reports— The Bills were read twice, referred to the committee of the whole house on the state of the Union, and with the report ordered to be printed— In Committee Granger made a verbal report on the claim of Commodore Ridgely, that two members thought it should not only be rejected, but that a report should be made to the house, exposing the conduct of the Commodore to severe censure, for daring to present such a claim. I prevailed on the majority however to consent to a simple report that Commodore Ridgely have leave to withdraw his petition— In the house, William Russell of Ohio offered a Resolution that the hour of meeting of the house after next Monday should be 11. O’Clock till further order. Barnard objected— Russell moved a suspension of the rules, but the speaker declared that not in order— Russell shook his finger at Barnard, and said I’ll mark you— Botts made his hour speech against the bill to refund the Jackson fine— Moore of Louisiana took the floor on that question for to-morrow— Cushing made his hour speech against the Committee of Ways and Means and the whigs, for rejecting the Tyler Webster Exchequer— Adjourned at 3. I rode home— Dusty gale— Mr Newhall came, and I gave him a Letter to Edward Everett. R. Rush took tea and spent the Evening here— Hull went to Alexandria. "

John Davies, a coloured man, came this morning with a Letter from himself to me—asking my advice in behalf of his wife’s son, named Joseph Clark, sold some years since by Mrs Hellen to someone, who sold him to the Senator Berrien, who sold him to a Coll. Curry; an agent or subagent employed in the removal of the Cherokee Indians. Currey took him to the state of Arkansas, employed him as an interpreter, and pomised him his freedom— Currey afterwards died, and by his Will, declared Clark free, after 3 years service to his brother— The rascal brother sold him for 900 dollars, and he is now in irredeemable Slavery for life— The mother of this poor man, Jenny lived sometime with us, and at her instance her husband Davies came to ask my advice what can be done for him.— But he has neither means to sue for his freedom, nor evidence to prove the Will— He is now living with a Dr. Davis Flint, Cherokee Nation, and is acting as interpreter— Can I not possibly do something for this man?— Mr Coleman, late Commissioner of Agriculture in Massachusetts, came with a subscription book to defray the expence of his going to England and France as a Commissioner at large to make and publish discoveries in Agriculture— I subscribed for one copy of his book, which is to appear in numbers; but he declined receiving the dollar in advance required by his prospectus. I called a second time at the Treasury Department, and enquired of Mr M’Clintock Young, the Chief Clerk the amount paid, to certain inhabitants of East-Florida, under the Act of 1834. and the amount claimed by the inhabitants of West-Florida, and for which the bill now before the house is intended to provide— Mr Young said there would not be time to the end of this Session of Congress to report upon such an enquiry; but he shewed me the papers of one claim on Amelia Island upon which between 5 and 6000 dollars have been allowed and paid; a mere transient glance at which opened to me a dungeon of fraud and swindling claims.— At the house, Fillmore, chairman of the Committee of Ways and means succeeded in screwing at once into consideration the Resolution against the Tyler Webster Forward exchequer bill. Three one hour speeches were successively delivered by D. D. Barnard—R. C. Winthrop, and T. F. Marshall, all of the highest order of eloquence, though with irreconcileable dissent of opinions. Pendleton took the floor at the adjournment— The house nearly deserted during great part of Barnard’s and Winthrop’s speeches, by members slinking away to hear the new Senator from South-Carolina, M’Duffie— We had sundry evening visitors among whom J. Connell, who has purchased a Carriage for me at Philadelphia— Isaac Hull Adams, and Walter Hellen went yesterday to Alexandria, and returned this day. "

Tuesday the 7th. of February was specially assigned for the consideration of a joint resolution concerning reciprocity Treaties— Kennedy reported also a bill to establish a warehousing system, with a report of which he moved then an extra number of 5000 copies should be printed— Cave Johnson objected; but at the earnest intreaty of Kennedy withdrew his objection— Payne of Alabama has the floor on the Jackson fine Resolution, but he has two days successively allowed it to be overridden— Fillmore moved to take up immediately the Negative Resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means on the Presidential Exchequer Bill the paternity of which was assumed by Daniel Webster in his too celebrated Faneuil Hall speech— Nathaniel G. Pendleton of Cincinnati Ohio a member of the Committee of Ways and Means, made an hour speech against the executive exchequer, followed by Wise in an hour speech of reply to Marshall’s paper kite of yesterday— Marshall was not in the house—a grievous lamentation to Wise, excessively sore under Marshall’s flagellation, and with his usual vindictive malignity eager to score Marshall return— Marshall was I suppose purposely absent, and Wise’s hot shot fell short of their object— He was cut short in a ludicrous attitude, with his arms expanded in the very delivery of a magnificent trope as he thought, by Charles G. Atherton, minority chairman of the Committee of ways and means, who spun out his hour in a dull laudatory exposition of the sub-treasury— Proffit, of the guard then pounced upon the sub-treasury and the democracy—scolding like a Poissarde; and repeating one hundred and one times that under the Sub treasury Law not one dollar had ever been paid in specie— Adjourned at half past 3— I had gone during the debate for a few minutes into the Supreme Court room where 7 judges, (Story and M’Kinley absent from indisposition) were listening to an argument of John Sergeant— The hall was nearly empty— After the adjournment Stanly gave me a pamphlet appeal, written he told my by R.

Friday  Mr John Spear Smith was again here this morning; anxious about the French claim Bill, and enquiring whether it would not be expedient for me to give notice this day that I would call it up to morrow. I thought it would be waste of time and influence, and would surely fail— Mr Smith told me that the judges of the Supreme Court had yesterday without a word of previous notice removed Richard Peters from the Office of Reporter and appointed Ben C. Howard, heretofore a member of Congress from Baltimore, and a relative of Chief Justice Taney in his place— The Count de Menou called, and said he had received a duly authenticated genealogy of the heirs of Philip F Renaut, which he would have certified by Mr Pageot, and transmit to the house— I called again at the Treasury Department, and obtained from Mr Young the chief Clerk, a schedule of the claims of the inhabitants of West Florida, to be paid on the passage of the Bill now before the house and he afterwards sent me to the house a statement of the amount actually paid to the certain inhabitants of East-Florida, under the act of 1834.—upwards of 700000 dollars! While I was at the Treasury department our coachman Philip came round with the carriage to the door, and hearing that I was not in the house concluded I had walked on, drove to the Capitol thinking to overtake me on the way; and finding I was not there turned round and came back still in pursuit of me— When I returned home from the Treasury the Carriage was gone—and I set out trudge it on foot. going out from my door I met Mr Allen; member of the house from Maine, returning from one of the public offices and walked with him till in the Pennsylvania avenue we met my carriage coming back from the capitol. Mr Allen then went with me; and I found the house in Session, and Fillmore chairman of the Committee of ways and means, in final replication, chiefly to the charges of Cushing upon the resolution of the Committee that the President’s Exchequer ought not to be adopted— Giddings moved the previous question— Cushing withdrew his motion to strike out the word not. Thompson of Mississippi moved to lay the whole subject on the table, lost 66 to 141— Atherton’s amendment was rejected 105 to 115— The resolution of the majority of the Committee not to adopt the Webster exchequer carried 191 to 18 (remark 11. skulking votes—) Burnell moved a reconsideration, made a speech; and withdrew his motion. Charles J. Ingersoll, renewed the motion for reconsideration made an ambidexter speech, full of sense and nonsence, of wisdom and of knavery— Wise was one of the skulkers—and then bristled up—brag’d that what he abhorred above all things was dodging, and ordered the reporters to state that he would have voted for Atherton’s amendment and against Fillmore’s Resolution.— Adjourned— Lieutenant Wilkes here this evening— "

The Count de Menou and Mr Connell were here successively this morning very anxious, the Count, that the bill for the relief of the heirs of Philip Francis Renaut, and Connell that the bill for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton should be taken up and acted on by the house this day; but they were both disappointed— At the house a confused mass of intrusive business was admitted or rejected according to the humour of the house and the Speaker— Gilmer offered a Resolution calling on the President for any information about a negotiation for the cession of California, by Mexico to Great Britain—adopted without opposition— Giddings and Cowen alternate chairmen of the Committee of claims insisted upon the observance of the rule devoting the day for private business. Cushing moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up his exchequer bill—he said he had been reproached for not calling it up—moved to suspend the rules and called for the yeas and nays— Then withdrew the call for the yeas and nays, but said he would renew the motion to go into Committee and take up that bill every day till he should succeed— William W. Payne of Gainesville, Sumter County—Alabama, was big with his hour speech on the Jackson fine Resolution and demanded the opportunity to be delivered of it; in which the Speaker indulged him— His speech was a brawling declamation upon necessity—invective upon judge Hall upon me—upon Louaillier and the Legislature of Louisiana—at the time of the declaration of Martial Law— He read from Martin’s history of the War and from Eaton’s life of Jackson, and puffed and spouted himself out of breath— As his hour closed Dawson of Louisiana took the floor for the next fighting day.— Charles J. Ingersoll gave notice that he would on Monday ask leave to introduce a bill to amend the act organizing the Treasury Department— The house then went into the consideration of private business, and passed sundry bills but rejected by yeas and nays 55 to 92 that for the relief of the Petersburg Rail-road company— Then in Committee of the whole, Thomas M T. M’Kennon in the chair numerous other bills were reported to the house, all those against which any objection was made being set aside— I offered the joint resolution, drawn up by Mr Barnard, to authorise the appointment of 4 additional commanders in the navy, for the purpose of promoting lieutenant Wilkes— Meriwether and Mallory objected but finally consented to receive the resolution and refer it to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. The Bill for the relief of the inhabitants of West Florida, was postponed and made the special order of the day for next Friday— Burke objected to the bill for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton, and it was overlaid.

He read a very small portion of the morning prayer—omitting, the portion of the Psalms, the lesson from the old Testament—the litany, the portion of the communion, and even the reading of a psalm or hymn to be sung— The whole ceremony occupied not more than 50 minutes, and I thought was too much hurried over. The Sermon was from Hebrews 11.6. [“]But without Faith it is impossible to please him”— The subject was Faith; and having discoursed upon it myself, Mr Tiffany seemed to me to handle the subject superficially and feebly. The auditory was thin; not more than half the seats of the members being filled— My nephew the passed midshipman Joseph H dined with us.— After dinner at St. John’s, the Revd. Mr Smith of Smithfield, Virginia, brother to the member of Congress, William Smith, read the Evening prayers for the 4th Sunday after the Epiphany, and preached from Proverbs 23.26. [“]My Son, give me thy heart.”— The reverend gentleman appeared not to understand his text, for he commented upon it as if the speaker was God—whereas it was Solomon— The whole chapter is an affectionate paternal exhortation to temperance from sensuality—from eating—from drinking—from women— Temperance and moderation in the pursuit of wealth thriftiness and industry, benevolence and charity to the orphan poor, filial affection and observance of paternal precepts and example are all enjoined in this chapter—and the pathetic apostrophe, my Son give me thy heart is more impressive from the lips of the earthly parent, than in the gratuitous transfer of it to the Lord Jehovah himself. Mr Smith’s manner is cold and artificially emphatic— After church I went over and passed half an hour with Mr Thomas B. Johnson who recovers very slowly from his last paralytic shock—confined to the sopha in his bed-chamber—his speech almost unintelligible—his countenance cadaverous, and his spirits drooping in despondency. Richard D. Cutts and his sister Mary took tea with us, and I had a long evening visit from Mr Kerr, one of the Senators from the State of Maryland, and one of those whom I am accustomed to respect as among the best and worthiest of men— He is in politics a whig—with principles as pure as in a land of Slavery can be held: and of unsullied honour. We had much conversation on the aspect of our public affairs, with a great preponderance of discouragement. "

Gideon Morris is one of the western pioneers who told me he had a Cherokee family, and has some interest in a bill now before the house for carrying into effect a Treaty with the Cherokees— He came to ask my influence to get it through, and referred me to Joseph L. Williams of Tennessee, for information concerning it— Williams spoke to me about it; but the confusion in the house was so great, and I was so much absorbed in the business before it, that I knew just as much of the Cherokee Treaty and Gideon Morris’s claim after he finished as before he began. I must wait till the bill comes up— Mr George Brown came with two gentlemen from Lowell named Bixby, and whom he introduced to me, and with whom I was talkative— At the house, this was the day to call the States for Resolutions, and I had prepared two—calling on the President for information respecting the exploit of Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones, at Monterey in California—but Wise and Cushing immediately moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up their exchequer bill— The house taking no heed to my remonstrance, went floundering into Committee Hopkins in the chair. Wise moved to postpone the army appropriation bill, and take up his beloved exchequer— But Filmore insisted upon taking up the army appropriation bill, and the Committee refused to postpone it by a vote of 71 to 82— Reynolds of Illinois moved an amendment of 20000 dollars, for a military survey from the council bluffs to the mouth of Columbia river.— After some discussion in which Cushing avowed his ravenous appetite for the occupation of the Oregon Reynolds’s motion was rejected, and Fillmore seeing that debate would waste time, moved that the Committee should rise for the sole purpose of voting that debate should cease and the bill be reported to the house this day at 3 O’Clock which he afterwards consented to extend to half past 3—all this was done as Fillmore proposed— In the interval while the house was resumed I offered my two resolutions—but Gilmer objected to one, and Mallory to the other and they were not received— There was a snarling debate on the appropriations for West Point Academy; many proposed amendments rejected, and some trifles adopted— The Bill was at last reported to the house, and driven by the screws of the previous question to vote that the question should be taken on its passage now—but then a motion to adjourn was carried in spite of Llandaff W. Andrews’s stare, and yeas and nays— There had been two reports from the Committee of Ways and Means, against the Memorials for W. Cost Johnson’s 200,000,000 of Land stock to pay the State debts— Cushing cram’d the reading of the majority report down the throat of the house, at the cost of many a curse— Franklin Whitney was here this evening.

Present Adams, Cushing, Granger, Stuart, Holmes, Caruthers, Meriwether— Absent Everett and Shepherd— I read the Note of the Secretary of State to me, suggesting the wish, that the restrictions on the application of the sum of 40000 dollars proposed to be appropriated for the mission to China, should be struck out from the bill—and after some discussion, I obtained authority 5 to 2 to move in the house to strike out the restrictions. I then requested to be instructed to move in the house, in the name of the Committee the two Resolutions, moved by me in the house yesterday; but objected to by Gilmer and Mallory and not received, calling on the President for information, correspondence, and all the instructions to Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones, relating to his invasion of the Californias and capture of Monterey on the 19th. of last October.— Question was made whether the usual exception of what the President might deem it incompatible with the public interest to communicate should not be inserted. I said I had left it out purposely—the act of Commodore Jones being avowedly War, and that being exclusively within the Constitutional power of Congress to declare, I thought the usual exception would be improper. Granger said that on a former occasion he had insisted on the insertion of the usual exception; but as this was a case of actual War the thought the exception should not be inserted— Cushing questioned what he calls the jurisdiction of the Committee—the subject not having been referred to them by the house— But my motion was carried 5 to 2. Holmes and Cushing voting No— Cushing asked and obtained leave to move in the house to take the French claims bill out of the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union next Tuesday.— At the house on the call of the Committees for Reports, James A. Pearce from the Committee on the judiciary presented a report on the General Jackson fine case, which occasioned no small agitation— Pearce moved the printing of 5000 extra copies, and also of C. J. Ingersoll’s minority report of last Summer: but objection was made, and the order to print was only for the usual number— The morning hour expired, and territorial business was the special order of the day.— A bill to authorize the western States to sell their Lands reserved for schools was driven through against the warm remonstrances of Howard of Michigan, and after a heart-rending ovation of the younger Dodge, delegate from Ioway, a bill to pay Ioway Militia for battling against Missouri usurpation, rejected last Summer was now reconsidered and passed.— I delivered at the Clerk’s Office, Franklin Whitney’s petition and papers, and asked their reference to the judiciary Committee— "

There was a party of 7 or 800 last Evening at Mr Charles A Wickliffe the Post-master General’s, to which we were all invited, but only Isaac Hull went— It was what in London is called a rout; and here a jam an overflowing multitude treading upon one another’s heels and toes, and forming a consolidated mass, without room for motion. At the house this morning the hour allotted to the call for reports from Committees was delayed nearly an hour by senseless or malicious resolutions, among which Thompson of Mississippi the repudiator moved a reconsideration of the vote of yesterday passing the army appropriation Bill— His pretended purpose was to make large retrenchments; and he expatiated largely upon the emptiness of the Treasury, the deficiency of the revenue, and the absolute necessity of great reductions of expenditures. Granger answered him in a speech of cutting sarcasms, and the motion was laid on the table by a seemingly unanimous vote— But Thompson will go home and make capital on the stump by his motion— The call on Committees for reports followed and when the foreign affairs were called Cushing reported the resolution to take the French claims bill out of Committee of the whole on the Union next Tuesday—which started a most cankerous debate of half an hour bristled with points of order and at last a mention by Cave Johnson to lay the whole subject on the table—lost by yeas and nays 90 toThen the previous question, seconded and a vote not to take the main question now— I then offered from the Committee of foreign Affairs my two resolutions of call upon the President for information, correspondence and instructions, relating to Ap Catesby Jones’s exploits in California— Wise objected, and said he had a Letter from Captain Jones himself, which would explain the whole affair to the satisfaction of the house. Granger had moved the previous question, and offered to allow the reading of Captain Jones’s Letter, but declined withdrawing his motion, without which Wise would not have Jones’s Letter read— The previous question was seconded 93 to 70. Wise asked if he could move to postpone the subject—the Speaker said no, but he could move to lay it on the table— Wise asked if the morning hour was expired. The speaker said yes— Wise called for the orders of the day— The territorial bills were then taken up and debated, in Committee of the whole Joseph R. Ingersoll in the Chair till the time for adjournment— Two confidential messages were received from the President and referred without reading to the Committee on Indian Affairs— Dr Frye dined with us, and S. D. Smith, and Walter Hellen were here this evening. "

I have no respite from the anxieties of attendance upon the business of the house— On Monday last one of the days specially assigned by the rules of the house for the reception of resolutions I had prepared two, calling on the President for information, correspondence and instructions relating to the invasion of California, by Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones last October— Two abortions of attempt had already been made to call partially for this information one by Gwin of Mississippi; a blunderer, too stupid to see the issues of his own movements, and another by Botts, who was immediately arrested by a hint from Wise— The duty of the house to call for this information was in my belief so transcendent that I could no longer forbear to initiate the call myself.— But on Monday Wise contrived to get a vote of the house superseding the reception of Resolutions, by going into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union; though he failed to get up the exchequer bill for which he had made the motion— I nevertheless presented my Resolutions; but a single objection sufficed to exclude them from reception, and Gilmer and Mallory objected— My Resolutions were returned to me from the Clerk’s table— I reproduced them the next morning in the Committee of foreign Affairs; and obtained an instruction from them to report them from the Committee— But Cushing’s motion to fix a time for taking the French claims out of Committee occupied the whole morning hour of Tuesday— It was not till yesterday that I could report the two Resolutions, and then Wise by chicanery, still kept off the decision till there had been announced a second to the previous question— This morning a desperate attempt was again made to supersed the morning hour by going at once into Committee of the whole on the territorial business— But I insisted on the question upon my resolutions— Cushing asked to be excused from voting, because the usual exception was omitted, and was excused— Wise asked to be excused, and after a trifling speech withdrew his motion and voted— The resolutions were adopted by yeas and nays 118 to 69. of which last at least ten dough faced democrats changed their votes from ay to no after the roll had been called through.— The came the votes on Cushing’s motion to take the French claims out of Committee— Motion to lay the whole subject on the table lost 94 to 104— Motion to take the main question now—lost 94 to 100. After this, the territorial bills consumed the remainder of the day— I got involved suddenly and unexpectedly in the discussion of one of them to provide payment for an illegal meeting of the legislature of Wisconsin, which dragged on till the committee rose twice for want of a quorum, and two motions to adjourn had been rejected by yeas and nays; and at last the house adjourned with out taking them— Richard D. Cutts and his Sister were here this Evening. Cold weather— Fahrenheit this morning 18. "

V:30— Friday  Mr Leavitt called on me this morning and lent me an English pamphlet recently published at London under the title of American Whites and Blacks, in reply to a German Orthodermist by E. S. Abdy—M.A which he said was a specimen of the working of American Slavery to pervert the public opinion upon the merits of American Slavery in Germany.— Mr Leavitt rode with me to the capitol— At the house among the Reports from Committees was one by Samson Mason from the Committee of Ways and Means, to refund the balance due to the State of Massachusetts for disbursements during the last war with Great Britain—a harbour Bill by John P Kennedy, chairman of the Committee of Commerce; and a bill by Mr Underwood Chairman of the Committee on the district of Columbia to amend the Charter of the City of Alexandria— Hitherto the Mayor has been elected by the common council, elected themselves, by the householders.— The Bill provides that the same voters who elect the Council shall also elect the Mayor Cave Johnson began some stir about an amendment to impart universal suffrage; but Underwood reminded him of my motion upon the bill of the last Session, to strike out the word white, from his universal suffrage, and he was quiet as a mouse and let the bill pass in silence— Pearce called up his motion to print 5000 extra copies of the Report of the judiciary committee on General Jackson’s fine, but could not get a vote upon it. Cushing insisted upon a decision upon his motion to take the French claims bill out of the committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Atherton moved to lay Cushing’s motion on the table and it was carried by yeas and nays 97 to 93— Private and territorial business followed Levy who had the floor by assignment upon the bill for the relief of the inhabitants of Florida, made a show as if he was very anxious to make his speech upon it, but suffered it to pass over for other bills to be taken up. I went down to the room of the Supreme Court, where John J. Crittenden was arguing a Kentucky land cause— I was recalled by a message from Mr Giddings, upon another demonstration of Levy that he wished to speak upon his West-Florida bill; but before I got back to my Seat, his impulse had subsided, and other business had succeeded— The pension appropriation Law was taken up and passed— Meriwether, attempted to get the bill for the relief of James C. Watson discharged from the Committee of the whole, but failed— A number of Bills against which no objection was heard, were passed— Adjourned at half past 3. "

Saturday  Mr Lewis Johnson was here this morning and brought a letter to Mr Ebenezer Gay of Hingham to be forwarded to him, concerning the monies recovered for the estate of the late William Otis. As I took my seat in the house Mr Otis one of the reporters came and asked me to go into the Speaker’s room to see a blind man named Benjamin B. Bowen, who wished to deliver a Lecture upon the education of the blind— I went accordingly and found the Speaker in his chamber, with Mr M’Kennon of Pennsylvania, Mr Briggs of Massachusetts, and the blind man, who was introduced to me— After a short conversation with him, Mr M’Kennon said that Mr Bowen would deliver a lecture on the education of the blind, to-morrow evening at the Unitarian church, and wished to obtain the use of the Representative hall, to deliver another lecture on the same subject next Monday, and asked me to make the motion to that effect in the house, to which I reluctantly agreed— I did accordingly make the motion, and it was adopted without opposition— Mr Summers of Virginia, came with a more aukward proposal— He is charged by Samuel T. Washington to present to Congress the sword used by General George Washington in the Revolutionary War— And he intends to make a sentimental patriotic speech on presenting it— And he requested me to offer the joint resolution accepting the sword and proposing the disposal of it— His own opinion was to direct that it shall be deposited in the hall of the National Institute for the promotion of Science— I intreated him to excuse me from this service, but he pressed me till I gave way and consented to undertake it— The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Elisha H. Allen in the chair, and took up the Navy appropriation bill— Meriwether of Georgia moved a proviso reducing the pay of all the navy Officers 20 per cent— Fillmore objected that this amendment was not in order. Fillmore appealed from the decision, but the Committee 73 to 60 sustained the chairman— Then came up a stiff debate on Meriwether’s proviso, which at 3. O’Clock the Committee rose without deciding and the house adjourned. At 6 O’Clock I dined with Mr Hulsemann the Chargé d’Affaires from Austria, with the company noted above in the Margin— Home before 9. O’Clock, the ground covered with snow— "

Sunday  There was a fall of Snow last evening which covered the ground with a white garment complete this morning but it melted, leaving scarce a trace behind in the course of this day I attended public worship at the hall of the house of representatives— The Revd. Mr M Caulay of Cincinnati officiated, at the request he announced of Mr Tustin who was indisposed— The auditory was very small. The service of not more than one hour beginning by the reading of a chapter— No singing— A Sermon of 40 minutes from Psalm 77 19—[“]Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.” This is a Psalm of Asaph, and addressed to the chief musician Jeduthun.— In the 15th. and 16th chapters of the first book of Chronicles, is the account of the institution by David of the Choir of Musicians vocal and instrumental, on the occasion of the final bringing up of the Ark from the house of Obed-Edom; and of the appointment of Asaph and of Jeduthun as leaders of the Choir— David then delivered to them a psalm of his own composition to be sung with an accompaniment of Harps, and Psalteries and Cymbals— This institution appears to have been supplementary to the Levitical ritual ordained of Sinai— Asaph’s instrument is expressly said to have been the cymbal—and several of the sublimest Psalms are announced as his but whether composed by him may be questioned.— Mr M’Caulay’s exposition of his text was a dissertation upon the mysterious and incomprehensible ways of divine Providence; a theme very easy to amplify by illustration. The ignorance of man with regard to all the dispensations of the divine government were fully proved, and the consolation administered for it by the preacher was the promise of more enlarged views, and more comprehensive knowledge in the future spiritual world; of the enjoyments of which he drew a vivid and delightful portraiture Thus it is to live upon hope and upon this subject, during our pilgrimage here be indulged with nothing more.— After dinner I went to St. Johns Church, but there was no service performed there. I then went to the second presbyterian church, and heard the Revd. Mr Sheldon, who supplies for a time the pulpit there, preach from Malachi 3.16. [“]Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another. and the Lord hearkened, and heard it: and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name.” This was a scolding discourse— Mr Rush took tea and spent part of the evening cleared off cold— "

I desired time to consider the expediency of adding my name to the list— The house first this morning met at 11. O’Clock, and are to meet at that hour every morning till further order.— I called on Mr Summers to arrange the manner in which he proposes to present to the house, the sword and cane of Washington to morrow— He promised to call on me this evening at my house, and read to me the speech that he intends to make. Morgan of New-York asked me to give him the manuscript of what I shall say—but I told him I knew not what I should say. Among the reports of Committees was one by Cowen from the Committee of Claims with a bill for the relief of Amos Kendall, who is within prison limits upon a judgment against him as Postmaster General— Cowen wished that a day should be fixed for the consideration of the bill, or to take it up immediately, but it was referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and ordered to be printed— J.

Cooper, and Arnold of Tennessee made long speeches and Arnold extorted an order fixing a day to consider his bill N. 548— Mark A.

Under some depression of Spirits, and a diffidence of which I cannot divest myself I wrote last night and this morning a few sentences laudatory of the two worthies who were to dignify the ceremony of this day, and at 10 this morning attended the meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Present Adams, Everett, Granger, Shepperd, Caruthers, Stuart, Meriwether— We had memorials from Fredericsburg Va. and from Alexandria; praying for the establishment of a line of packets to Chagres, in connection with a Mail conveyance over the isthmus to Panama— They were after some discussion referred to Mr Shepperd. There was a Letter to the Secretary of the Treasury from some officer of the colonization Society, claiming an appropriation of 5000 dollars for the support of Slaves, who may be taken by our squadron on the coast of Africa— Mr Forward had sent the letter to the chairman of the Committee of ways and means, Fillmore, at whose motion it had been referred by the house to the Committee of foreign affairs— Mr Everett drew up a section which I was instructed by the Committee to move in the house, as an amendment to the navy appropriation bill now in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— His first motion was that it should be introduced into the bill for carrying into execution the Ashburton Treaty—but on discussion it was concluded that although the Treaty stipulates that we shall keep for five years a squadron of 80 guns on the coast of Africa, for the purpose of capturing American Slavers, yet it has no reference to the disposal of the captured slaves— By a report from the Secretary of the Treasury on a resolution of the Senate, it was estimated that the cost of keeping this squadron will be for the first year half a million of dollars, and for the four others 300000 dollars a year. At the house, during the morning hour Fillmore moved a Resolution to take the Naval Appropriation Bill out of Committee of the whole on the State of the Union at 2 O’Clock to-morrow, and carried it by moving the previous question, which Cave Johnson in vain moved to lay on the table, and lost 68 to 95, and Arnold obtained by a suspension of the rules and order to make his bill N. 548 the special order of the day for next Tuesday by yeas and nays 131 to 53.— At 12 O’Clock Mr Summers rose and presented from Samuel T. Washington, the sword of General Washington and the cane bequeathed to him by Benjamin Franklin, with a beautiful and affecting speech— I moved a joint resolution accepting the present, disposing of the present, and giving the thanks of Congress to the donor— The Resolution passed unanimously; and the house adjourned— Evening visit from the Revd.

The winter after an excursion of five or six weeks has returned upon us with keen severity— Yesterday morning at sunrise my thermometer was at 12, and this morning at 16. Immediately after the adoption of the joint resolution offered by me yesterday, Mr Taliaferro moved that Mr Summers’s address to the house, and mine should be entered on the journal, which was unanimously adopted. This morning Briggs moved that the Letter from Samuel T. Washington tendering the present and a Letter of George C. Washington identifying the articles, be entered upon the journal with the proceedings of the house; and Mr Taliaferro moved that 20000 copies of the full journal of the house relating to the subject be printed to be distributed by the members of the house among their constituents; both which motions were unanimously adopted— James A. Pearce the reporter from the judiciary Committee against the refunding of General Jackson’s fine, had moved the printing of 5000 extra-copies both of his report and of the supplementary report of the minority report by Charles J. Ingersoll Romulus M Saunders and James I. Roosevelt—objection had been made to the motion, and it had thus been shuffled off by the Jackson Jackalls with the hope of suppressing its circulation among the people as they have done with Winthrop’s report on the oppression of coloured Seamen in Southern ports—but Pearce fastened his motion upon the house this day and carried it— Thompson of Indiana moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday which laid on the table Cushing’s motion to fix a day for considering the French claims bill— The Speaker decided that Thompson’s motion was not in order Thompson appealed, but the decision of the Speaker was sustained. Joseph R. Ingersoll moved to print 10000 copies of the two reports from the Committee of Ways and Means, against W. Cost Johnson’s project for assuming and paying the State debts. Waterston objected— At the expiration of the morning hour Holmes took the floor on the navy appropriation Bill, followed by Joseph L. White of Indiana, and Charles Brown, with the interludes by Fillmore, Wise and Meriwether, till at 2 O’Clock the voting on the amendments began. Meriwether’s razor was rejected— My amendment from the Committee of foreign Affairs was adopted without opposition— The Bill was reported to the house, about 3— and carried through by the previous question; and a losing game motion by Fillmore for reconsideration— I had evening visits from Dr. M’Caulay, Mr Rush and Mr Shields of Alabama. Dr M’Caulay was importunately urgent for a commendatory certificate from me in favour of his work on patriotism—but I said no. "

The cold weather produces perturbation in my daily occupations, and particularly in the most irremissible of them all the Diary— It delays my rising hours, and when risen I cannot write until the chamber is warm—that is till after breakfast— And thenceforward I have for the remainder of the day I have no command of my time— Arrearage arises, and double labour to redeem it— Mr Leavitt called on me, and spoke of the underhand movements to carry by springing a mine, the annexation of Texas to this Union— He suggested that some of the members thought of uniting in an address to the people of the free States against it. Mr Giddings had intimated to me yesterday a similar purpose, in which I told him I would very readily concur—but that I had no confidence in the firmness of any one member from the free States, to put their names to any such address.— I was belated this morning by 20 minutes in reaching the house, and found them in a snarl of a debate on a question about the reception of a report of one member (Aycrigg) of the select Committee on the Coast survey— In the course of which debate W. Cost Johnson protested against a practice of recent origin of receiving partial and minority reports, and complained of the double report of the Committee of Ways and means against his project of creating two hundred millions of stocks hypothecated on the public lands to pay the debts of the States. Joseph R. Ingersoll, and Pickens, the authors of the two reports, and Fillmore, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means kindled into a flame, in support of the unanimity of their report— This debate was all episodical; and I suggested to W. C. Johnson, that he was making up an issue upon a mere immaterial incident and not upon the vital point— Aycriggs report was received, and ordered to be printed— Mr Crawford the new member from Georgia asked an explanation of some disparaging allusion to him made yesterday by Charles Brown, who immediately frittered it away by explanation— 10000 extra copies of the annual report of the commissioner of patents were ordered to be printed— A bill came from the Senate for the occupation of the Oregon Territory— Pendleton moved to refer it to the Committee on Military Affairs. Reynolds to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—and Everett, to the Committee of foreign affairs— The two former motions were rejected—and Everett’s adopted—upon which Andrew Kennedy of Indiana said aloud, There is the end of that— The rest of the day was consumed in long and dull debates on Columbia district business— Evening calls from sundry persons among whom Mr Etheridge, Secretary to Commodore Hull "

Friday  My business crowds upon me beyond endurance, and almost every day, from an impulse that I cannot resist, I plunge into new controversies with which I ought not to meddle. I was again belated though by not more than five minutes in reaching the house and found Dawson of Louisiana struggling for the floor on the Jackson fine Resolution— Several members had moved resolutions of reconsideration on votes yesterday taken— Among them was one referring to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, a bill surreptitiously smuggled into the house by Reynolds of Illinois; being the same bill, which Dr Linn of Missouri has been worming through the Senate for the benefit of Tom Benton— The Senate Bill had after a double tug had been referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs. Everett now moved to reconsider the reference of Reynolds’s bill to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, and that it be referred to the Committee of foreign affairs—which was carried, without a division— Fillmore from the Committee of Ways and Means reported a Bill to authorise the Secretary of the Treasury to re-issue Treasury notes as they shall be paid in— Joseph R. Ingersoll brought up quite mal a propos his motion to print his and Pickens’s reports from the Committee of Ways and Means, against W. Cost Johnson’s project of issuing 200,000000. of stock at 3 per Cents hypothecated upon the proceeds of the public lands.—both reports are ridiculously shallow—and very uncourteous to Johnson, and to his Committee— Dawson was in the agonies of parturition upon the fine, so I thought I would start new game; and opposed the printing of any extra copies of the two reports— This was perfectly desparate as to success—taking the stud upon both the great parties of the Country— They will vote down my objection by a nearly unanimous conclusion, but I proved them wrong and taking governor M’Nutt’s letter and the State of Mississippi to task for repudiation, struck flint and steel together which will make another week morning hour’s debate— Gwin and Thompson the two members from Mississippi were frantic—but Gwin had only five minutes to empty his bile-bag on me for this day; and has the floor for another emission to-morrow. Ingersoll was touched and angry but I disclaimed all personal imputation. The house passed for the remainder of the day to the District business. I invited the Massachusetts members to meet at my house at 7. tomorrow evening— Augustus Young came this evening to my house and assured me that he had discovered the quadrature of the circle— Coll. Murray of New York was also here. "

Special meeting of the Committee of foreign affairs, called by me for the consideration of the two Bills for the occupation of the Oregon territory Present, Adams, Cushing, Granger, Stuart, Shepperd, Caruthers, Holmes, Meriwether—absent Everett who afterwards told me that he had been all night sick, and could not come. Before the Committee was full I took up the Memorial of Hope and Co. claiming the responsibility of the Government of the United States for a debt contracted by the territory of Florida, which was again referred to Mr Cushing, as it had been at the last Session when he made no report. The Senate Bill for the occupation of the Territory of Oregon was then read; and Holmes instantly moved to report against it— There was no discussion of its merits or of its details; but I was desirous of leaving some record of the vote— I polled the Committee—Granger, Stuart, Shepperd, Caruthers and Holmes, voted against both bills. Meriwether, for the Senate Bill— Cushing for it, with an amendment which he said he would offer— I moved to be instructed in the event of the house’s refusing to accept the report against the bill, to move an amendment that there should be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude, except upon conviction for crime, throughout the territory—and I asked that the yeas and nays on this proposition should be taken and recorded on the minutes— It was finally agreed that the Chairman should move in the house that the Senate bill should be printed, and that the question upon reporting the bills be postponed till next Tuesday— In the house, Gwin of Mississippi—disgorged his swindler-spleen upon me for exposing his knavery, and that of his Governor M’Nutt— He gave also a blast to Granger who repaid him in his own coin— W. Cost Johnson then took the floor for the next morning hour; the extra printing of the reports of the Committee of Ways and Means wedged out the Jackson fine for the present— Levy’s Bill of plunder for the inhabitants of East Florida had been made the special order for this day. I had moved to lay it on the table; but withdrew the motion to let him reply to my argument; which he did with a warm hour speech. I rejoined a few words and renewed the motion to lay the bill on the table lost by yeas and nays 73 to 77. Landaff W. Andrews moved the previous question which cut off Giddings’s amendment. The bill was rejected 36 to 136.— Weller moved a reconsideration to let Levy make another hour speech which he did— I was provoked to the boiling point but made no reply. Fillmore moved to lay the motion for reconsideration on the table; which was carried by acclamation.— This Evening the members of the Massachusetts delegation in both houses held a consultation with me, about the Latimer Petition, in which we came to no conclusion; but are to wait for the petition to arrive.

Mr Tiffany preached for Mr Tustin who is unwell, but Mr Tiffany gave notice for him that he would preach next Sunday. The whole service was of not more than three quarters of an hour. The auditory thin—the seats of the members perhaps two thirds of them filled— The text was from Hebrews 2.10—“for whom are all things and by whom are all things”— This is about half of the verse, and the verse itself, is only a fragment of an argumentative discussion upon the nature attributes and powers of Jesus Christ, which forms the subject of the epistle to the Hebrews— It begins abruptly, without naming the writer as all the other new Testament epistles do, by declaring that Jesus as the Son of God is superior to all the prophets and all the angels— That God appointed him heir of all things, and by him made the worlds. There is a confusion of phraseology, and a blending of persons in the first three chapters of this epistle in the english bible, which I cannot disentangle— It speaks throughout of Christ as a created being, a begotten being, a Son and yet as pre-existing, to the creation of the worlds, as creating them himself, and as taking upon himself the nature of man, inferior to the angels for the deliberate purpose of being persecuted and put to death for the salvation of the whole human race, before and after him— Is not this a clumsy scaffolding for religious faith? Give me the Sermon on the mount and I am a Christian— Mr Tiffany’s discourse did not advert to the peculiar character or composition of the Epistle to the Hebrews; nor enquire who was its author— It passes for the work of the Apostle Paul— I doubt if it is not of later date than the apostolic age— Mr S. D. Smith dined with us— After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read the evening prayers for Septuagesima Sunday, and preached from 1. Peter 2.4— To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God, and precious, 5. ye also, as lively stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.— After church I went over to see Mr Thomas B. Johnson. I found Dr Thomas coming out of the house as I went in— Mr Johnson was quite unwell—in a state approaching to a lethargy— I sat with him about a quarter of an hour, but could not rouse his interest in any thing. He was to be cupped this evening. After the service this morning I passed an hour in the chamber of the Committee of foreign Affairs, making up the minutes of the proceedings at the meeting yesterday morning. This evening we had visitors, Mr Child—Mr Joseph Head of Worcester and Mr Colton—late Editor of the true whig. "

First Meeting of the select Committee on the Memorials praying for the creation of two hundred millions of Stocks hypothecated on the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, called by William Cost Johnson, chairman, was held at 10 this Morning in the Committee room of the Committee of the District of Columbia— The members present, besides Johnson were Calvary Morris of Ohio James H. Cravens of Indiana Zadok Casey of Illinois and at last, just as we were going up to the house, Thomas F. Marshall of Kentucky, who came into the Committee room, puffing out a lighted segar.— Mr Johnson read the memorial referred to the Committee, and there were several others— Mr Johnson moved that the Committee should chuse a Chairman; but I decidedly objected to that and he acquiesced.— Our conversation was of a general character, and I said that from the all but universal prejudice against the plan, There could be no possible expectation of its being even listened to at this Session of Congress. That I dared not even hope that we could defeat Joseph R. Ingersoll’s motion to print and circulate 10000 copies of these two reports from the committee of Ways and Means, crushing in the bud the very conception of the plan— That I believed all that could now be done, would be for the chairman to prepare an elaborate report shewing the impossibility of the federal governments escaping from responsibility for the debts of the States—analysing those debts; demonstrating that the great mass of them have been contracted for useful and national purposes; that the ultimate result of them when completed would vindicate them even as measures even of sound economy, and refuting with sound argument both the reports from the Committee of Ways and Means— That I believed such a report could be now made, and left as a germ for future enlargement and improvement—and this was all that could be done, to any useful purpose now— We agreed to meet again next Thursday morning— In the house the day was a convulsion— Moore of Louisiana made a gasp to go into Committee of the whole on the bill to refund the fine of General Jackson but it failed.— Giddings made a noble hour speech against our base patronage of the Slave trade—on a bill to pay out from the Treasury, money received from the British Government for the Comet and Encomium— Cushing the sycophant answered him, and Dawson the drunken bully insulted him— The house tamely passed it over— A beggarly message was received from the President, upon which Wise bullied the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, a full hour, without disturbing his serenity. All this I witnessed with boiling indignation but in silence— I foresaw a day shortly to come, for an explosion from which I cannot flinch. "

Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs; Present Adams, Cushing, Everett, Granger, Shepperd, Stuart, Caruthers, Merriwether and Holmes—the whole Committee— As soon as the Committee was formed (by a Quorum) while waiting for the other members, Mr Cushing’s report on the Ashburton Treaty was taken up, and he read a large portion of it. The reading was suspended as soon as the Committee was full, and I read the minutes of the proceedings of the Committee last Saturday on the two bills for the occupation of the Oregon Territory— Mr Everett agreed with the majority to report against both the bills— But they unanimously rejected my motion to instruct me to move the amendment excluding Slavery from the new territory forever as it was from the Northwest territory— Granger said I could move it, as an individual member, and he would vote with me for it— Everett said he voted against my motion on the same ground taken by Mr Granger. The rest including Cushing all voted directly, and without assigning any reason against my motion— After some discussion I was instructed to move the reference of the two Bills to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, where they said no more would be heard of them at this Session— In the house, after a long jumble of Petitions presented out of order and privileged motions for personal explanations, Gwin of Mississippi got the floor on a pretence of personal explanation, but it was for the purpose, of replying to the charges of Granger against the fraudulent repudiation of her debts by the Legislature of the State of Mississippi— Granger rejoined upon him and proved by unquestionable documents the responsibility of the State upon her bonds, and the dishonesty of her refusal to pay them— At last Arnold succeeded in worrying the house into an order that they would take his bill N. 548 out of Committee this day at 3. O’Clock, and then twice into Committee of the whole, first Briggs and then Underwood in the Chair, and a Babel of amendments were offered, with inextricable confusion till 3. O’Clock— Then the debate no part of which had been upon the provisions of the bill, ceased, and questions were taken upon amendments till past 4 O’Clock when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— This evening I was visited by Samuel Elliot Guild son of Benjamin Guild of Brookline, near Boston. He has been here only a few days, and departs on his return home— Mr Hassler who is yet in conflict with the Committee on the Coast survey, and teazes me much though I can be of little service to him— And a Hollander by the name of Rypma, who teaches music, and came to have a talk with me because I had been in Holland.

O’Clock— Before going to the house, I had a quarter of an hour’s conversation with Cushing, and told him there was a War now in parturition between Freedom and Slavery, throughout the globe— That it would be a War for the abolition of Slavery—at the head of which would be Great Britain. That in this War I could take no part— I was going off the Stage; but he was coming on to it—and I conjured him, as he cherished his own and his Country’s honour, not to commit himself in this great controversy to the side of Slavery— And to return to the cause of liberty from which he had not yet irrevocably strayed— He heard me without taking offence, but apparently without conviction— I found the house in Session taking the questions upon the amendments to Arnold’s retrenchment bill N. 548. In Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Underwood in the chair— Twenty-six members in succession proposed amendments some of them 3 or 4, almost all of which were rejected. That which bore on the compensation and attendance of the members of Congress was offered by T. H. M M’Kennan and was adopted— Botts moved to report against the Bill. only 38. by tellers voted for that—as soon as the Bill was reported Cushing moved to lay it and all the amendments on the table lost by yeas and nays 42 to 167. The bill was forced through this day by suspension of the rules moved by Briggs— Yeas and nays 166 to 48. Baker, Briggs, Calhoun, Hudson and Parmenter voting ay— Adams, Saltonstall and Winthrop nay— Burnell and Cushing did not vote— Moore of Louisiana moved a reconsideration pro forma—lost without a count— The bill was irrevocably passed and the house adjourned— This evening Mr Cyrus Peirce was here; arrived with the great Latimer Petition, signed by 51680 names which I am requested by a resolution of a meeting to present— I advised Mr Peirce, who is from Nantucket to see all the members from the State of Massachusetts, and promised to consult with them on the subject "

A man by the name of Bird came this morning and enquired concerning a petition for a petition for a pension which he said I had presented for him five or six years ago— I had no recollection of it, but asked him to call again, being obliged to go immediately to attend the select Committee on the Memorials praying for the issuing of 200 millions of stocks hypothecated upon the proceeds of the sales of the public lands— At the meeting were present W. C. Johnson, Meredith P. Gentry, James H. Cravens, Calvary Morris, Jacob M Howard of Michigan and myself— Absent Marshall, Casey, and the 9th member.— There was further conversation upon the general topic, but it is evident nothing specific can be done at the present Session of Congress— I expressed the opinion that the chairman should prepare an argumentative report urging the transcendent necessity of the interposition of Congress for the relief of the People of the States overburthened with debt—closing with a resolution declaratory of that principle— A second Resolution declaring that there is not time at the present Session to mature a specific measure; and a third discharging the Committee from the further consideration of the subject— Mr Johnson appeared desirous of presenting his own bill, which may do as well to lay on the table as any thing else— We agreed to meet again at ten Saturday Morning— At the house after an abortive attempt of a Pennsylvanian dunce named Almon H. Read, to get a silly motion of his made and rejected yesterday upon the journal, the Committees were called for Reports— When the Committee of Foreign Affairs was called I reported the Bill from the Senate for the occupation of the Oregon territory, and for other purposes; and the same Bill, reported by Reynolds of Illinois in the house, without amendment; and with the opinion of the Committee, that neither of them ought to pass— They were then at my motion referred without opposition to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Mr John P. Kennedy’s joint resolution declaring the expediency of repealing the reciprocity treaties with the minor navigating powers, was at last taken up, and he made an able and elaborate hour speech in favour of that measure— Cushing discoursed upon it about half an hour, and Brewster a New-York borderer on Canada spoke earnestly in support of the reciprocity system— Fillmore move the Committee to rise, and say no more about this matter at the present Session. The Committee rose and the house adjourned— Mr Rush and Cyrus Pierce were here successively and wore out the evening— Mr Wylie brought me a Letter from James Mott— "

Present Adams, Cushing, Stuart, Caruthers, Meriwether— Absent Everett, Granger, Shepperd and Holmes— I returned to Meriwether, his manuscript report on the execution of the Ashburton Treaty, which he had lent me, and which I had carefully read— He now read it to the Committee— It is bitter and rancorous against Great Britain beyond all example; and excessively violent against the 8th. Article of the Treaty. It is a pure effusion of wormwood and of gall. I declared my dissent to its opinions from the first to the last line— And my dissent quite as explicit to all the report of Cushing, except what related to the boundary I proposed to abandon the idea of making a detailed report, and to confine it to a short statement of facts, merely glancing at the stipulations which we have engaged to fulfill and requiring the action of Congress for their fulfilment— As there was a bare majority of the Committee present we adjourned to Tuesday morning for a final decision on this subject— At the house after a prelude for Fillmore to report the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill for the new fiscal year from 1. July 1843 to 1. July 1844 and a struggle by D. D. Barnard to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union on the exchequer bill, W. Cost Johnson obtained the floor for the morning hour against Joseph R. Ingersoll’s motion to print 10000 extra copies of the two reports from the Committee of ways and means against the issuing of 200 millions of stock hypothecated on the proceeds of the sales of the public lands—when he finished Jacob Thompson of Mississippi took the floor to reply. Johnson’s argument was against the reasoning of J R. Ingersoll’s report, and he took little or no notice of the minority report of Atherton and Pickens— The regular business of the day was on private bills, but Fillmore moved to fix this day at 1/2 past 2 to cease debate on the amendments of the Senate to the army appropriation bill, and to take it out of Committee, which was carried, and then to go immediately into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union which was done— Alexander H H Stuart in the Chair— The Senate amendments and others were debated, and reported with amendments to the house, where they were passed upon, and the bill, with amendments to the Senate’s amendments returned to that body— This evening my colleagues, Baker, Briggs, Calhoun, Saltonstall were again at my house, and we agreed on the manner of presenting the great Massachusetts Latimer petition next Monday morning— Cushing and Parmenter did not come— Hudson and Burnell sick. Borden gone home. "

Marshall of Kentucky, James Cooper of Pennsylvania, Meredith P. Gentry of Tennessee and J. Q. Adams—and Jacob M. Howard of Michigan. absent Cravens of Indiana, and Casey of Illinois— The conversation was still general, and excepting Johnson and Gentry, all the members are scary upon the question of the assumption of State debts— Marshall, the most popular speaker in the committee, dreams of nothing but his own very doubtful re-election, and is afraid of encountering the odium of State debt assumption; and dares not look in the face the issue of foreign War waged in defence of repudiation— The memorials all urge the creation of two hundred Millions of 3 per cent stocks to be distributed among the States a measure impracticable now, and which never will be practicable; but no other will now be proposed— The Committee cannot now be brought to agree upon even any general principle of relief. The Chairman said that he would on Monday morning present a specific measure for the consideration of the Committee. I found the house 20 minutes in session, and in full squabble, about the removal of Jonathan Roberts and Calvin Blythe successively as Collectors of the customs at Philadelphia.— Toland had moved a call on the Secretary of the Treasury for the causes of the removal of Jonathan Roberts— Charles Brown by way of countercheck had moved for the causes of the removal of Blythe— The Secretary of the Treasury answers that there was no charge against either of them; and here was Charles Brown growling at Toland and Wise howling at Fillmore, to bully down the enquiry.— Wise howled himself so hoarse that he lost the power of articulation; and as for Toland’s small and feeble voice, not a word of it could be heard The expiration of the morning hour came to suspend for a moment the din of pandemonium Barnard made a struggle to get into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon his own substitute for Cushing’s exchequer, but failed— The bill for the relief of the heirs of Philip Renaut was rejected by yeas and naystoUnderwood cried aloud to take up the District and Territorial bills— I prevailed upon him by mere dint of intreaty to let the Bill for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton to be taken up. A motion to lay it on the table was rejectedtoThe previous question was called, sustained and carried— The Bill was passed 89 to 59. John C. Clark moved the reconsideration to foreclose it and the bill was sent to the Senate— Mr Connell was here this evening, delighted with the passage of the Bill— Walter Hellen and Mr Shipley also here "

At the Representatives Hall this morning Mr Tuston preached from the whole parable of the rich man, and Lazarus which I therefore here repeat Luke 16.19. “There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day 20. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores 21. And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. 22. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried 23 And in hell, he lifted up his eyes and being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom 24. And he cried and said, Father Abraham have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted and thou art tormented 26. And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us that would come from thence. 27. Then he said I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house; 28 For I have five brethren: that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment 29. Abraham saith unto him They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 30. And he said, Nay, father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. 31. And he said unto him, if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.”— This is a melancholy parable, and there is much to be said upon it which I will not say. Mr Tuston dwelt upon it chiefly as fixing beyond all peradventure the irredeemable eternity of future punishment— The auditory was very thin. After dinner at St John’s Church the evening prayer for sexagesima Sunday was read by Mr Nathaniel Sayre Harris heretofore an Officer of the army, and a teacher at the West Point Academy— His text was from Matthew 11.30. “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”— The Sermon was a very ingenious dissertation against the practice of dueling, raised on the basis of a position that the yoke of the world was harder and its burden heavier than that of Christ— He contrasted with great ingenuity the code of honour with the law of Christian forgiveness of injuries— I called at Mr T. B. Johnson’s after church, but he was asleep and I could not see him Coll. Murray of New-York was here this evening. "

Monday  Met the select Committee on William Cost Johnson’s two hundred millions of stock Bill— Johnon, Gentry, James Cooper, Howard and myself present, Morris, Marshall, Cravens and Casey absent— Casey has never attended, since the first meeting.— Marshall will do nothing to prepare or mature the plan—give him his theme and he makes a flashy gaudy speech; but he has neither stedfastness, nor perseverance for any thing. Johnson was not yet prepared with his specific proposal, but was forming sanguine hopes and calculations of the overwhelming popularity which gather round his plan hereafter, and very soon—of which I have no hope whatever.— The Committee still came to no conclusion. At the house the great Latimer petition signed by 51863. citizens of Massachusetts was in a frame on my table. It was the regular day, for the call of the States for petitions— The moment the journal was read I addressed the Speaker to call for the order of the day; but Gwin of Mississippi had caught the Speaker’s eye, and moved to go into committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the bill to refund General Jackson’s fine. At the same time Amos Gustine a usually silent member from Pennsylvania asked and obtained leave to present Resolutions from the Legislature of Pennsylvania urging the renewal of the act of 1838. allowing 5 years of pension to the widows of revolutionary soldiers; and he and Mathiot of Ohio, made an appeal so pathetic to the good feelings of the house that they actually discharged the Committee of the whole house on the state of the Union from a bill for that purpose referred to them, and actually passed the bill, through all its stages by an unresisted impulse— I then urged the motion to call for petitions, and called the yeas and nays on Gwins motion to go into committee of the whole on the state of the Union, which was carried 114 to 71— Of the majority 54 were members from the free States— Of the 71 only 5 were from the Slave States— When in committee of the whole, a struggle ensued what bill should be taken up. Gwin’s motion to take up the Jackson fine bill was rejected 67 to 91—a bill for collecting monies into the Treasury was first agreed to—then the bill for re-issuing treasury notes was taken up upon which Barnard hung his currency bill and Cushing his exchequer bill as amendments. Barnard and Cushing made hour speeches, Cushing’s amendment was twice voted on by tellers first 28 to 80. no quorum—then 38 to 98. then Barnard’s amendment was rejected 34. to 105—the bill was reported to the house, and passed by yeas and nays 111 to 51. Adjourned 88 to 75— R. D. Cutts here this evening. "

Cushing came in just as the Committee was about to adjourn— They examined the claim of J. J. De Wolf for compensation. He was appointed Consul atinin the island of Cape-Breton, in December 1837. and instructed to act as commercial agent, if he could obtain authority from the Governor of Nova Scotia, till he should receive his exequatur from England— In May 1838. he obtained this authority from the Governor, a notification of which he has transmitted published in the royal Gazette of Halifax— But a few days later early in June an order issued from the Secretary of State Forsyth enjoining him not to act as commercial agent until his exequatur as consul should be received—whereupon he came home, and now claims compensation for his time, and indemnity for his expenses. There was some discussion of the claim but no conclusion— Mr Cushing agreed to withdraw his report on the execution of the Ashburton Treaty—and there was a decided vote against allowing that of Mr Meriwether to be reported to the house at all— I was charged to move again in the house to take the french claims bill, out of Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— In the house I made another effort to obtain leave to present my petitions without success: not even so far as to obtain the yeas and nays against it— Thompson of Mississippi made an hour speech formally upon Joseph R. Ingersolls motion to print extra copies of the Reports from the Committee of Ways and Means on the State debts and Land loan, but really a swindler speech in honour of the State of Mississippi, for bilking her creditors. Mr Pope then got the floor for the next morning hour, and gave notice that he should offer his bank-tariff, currency, credit and land bill— Fillmore finally got the house into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Robert C. Winthrop in the chair— I claimed Fillmore’s promise to allow the China-bill to be taken up— I moved the amendment desired by Mr Webster, striking out the restriction upon the President in the application of the money and this started a debate of three hours, and a rivalry of black guard supremacy in reviling Daniel Webster, between John C. Clark and Samuel Gordon— Meriwether, Everett, Bronson and M’Keon opposed the bill all feebly and it was driven through by fixing the time for taking it out of Committee, and by the previous question and motion to reconsider, both of which I myself moved. R. Peters and W. H. Washington spent the Evening with me. "

Militia company parades— After the reading of the journal I moved to suspend the rules to enable me present 33 petitions upon a variety of subjects among which was the great Massachusetts Latimer Petition— The house was thin, and Stanly suggested that I should wait till after the call of Committees for reports, to take the question on my motion, to which I consented, on condition which the Speaker pledged to me that I should resume the floor after the call of Committees completed— When the Committee of foreign affairs was called, I offered the resolution to cease debate on the french claims bill, and take it out of Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to morrow at 2 O’Clock p.m. Romulus M. Saunders moved to lay my motion on the table; which was carried by yeas and nays 89 to 80—afterwards, my motion to suspend the rules was rejected 80 to 103. Charles J Ingersoll offered a Resolution of call on the President for any correspondence with the British Government on a difference of construction by President Tyler and Sir Robert Peel, with regard to the relinquishment by the British Government, in the late Ashburton Treaty of the right of visitation. Ingersoll sent to the clerk’s table a newspaper containing an extract of a speech of Peel, made at the recent meeting of Parliament, taking this issue with Captain Tyler— The Speech was not read but Ingersolls call was adopted— Then followed a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Thomas W. Gilmer in the chair. The navy pension bill harbour and light house bill, and fortification bill came up successively The Senate had sent back amendments to the fortification bill disagreed to by the house; upon which a Committee of Conference was appointed— The Committee rose without closing the debate on the harbour bill and the house adjourned after 4. O’Clock— My Latimer petition so entirely covered my table that it left me no space for writing at it and Brockway lent me his table for the day. I made out a list of 33. petitions, with the objects prayed for by them, and the Committees to which they should be referred, which I delivered to Mr Burch in the Clerk’s Office, demanding that they should be entered on the journal of the house, and that my list be returned to me for publication in the National Intelligencer. The Latimer Petition is among them; and there are two others for the dissolution of the Union— I had for visitors this evening Mr Henry Shaw of Lanesborough, and a Mr Campbell of Massachusetts; with George N. Briggs, also of Lanesborough, and Timothy Childs, of Rochester, New-York— I was much afflicted with the catarrhal fluxion this evening. "

A very bad night— Severe catarrh—splitting headache—restlessness and fever; relieved by perspiration— A half-crazy-man from Richmond Virginia, named Claiborne, a broken Innkeeper of that place, and by his own account a most intimate social friend and schoolfellow of John Tyler, brought me a Letter of introduction from John Taliaferro a member of the house from Fredericksburg— He desired me to allow him to take back this Letter; to keep it as a precious treasure in his family. I accordingly returned it. He kept me upwards of an hour without intermission, rattling off his own life and adventures, and especially his misadventures, and his blow up with John—he always calls him familiarly John—the day before last Christmas— He came here last October in pursuit of an office—any comfortable office— He had promises without number from John—but he found at last that his getting an Office was upon condition that he would turn Tylerite, and he was a whig to the core, and he would live and die a whig:—and had told John, that he would never like him turn a Somerset and prove a traitor to the whig cause— While he was holding forth in this manner like a mill-clapper, Mr Hayward and Mr Tucker strangers from Boston came in, announced their names, sat down and heard him till their patience was exhausted, then rose and went away leaving him still talking— Mr Leavitt came in and out-stayed him— He is about to return to Boston— At the house Briggs moved a suspension of the rules to instruct the committee on the judiciary to report a Bill repealing the Florida territorial Laws of 5. May 1842 against free coloured persons—lost by yeas and nays 66 to 104— There was some personal explanation about nothing between Thompson of Mississippi and Rayner of North-Carolina— Among the reports of Committees was one from the Ways and Means, on the finances, revenues and expenditures of the year, not sparing of severe animadversion upon the President— Cushing was prodigiously fussy about a Letter from Edward Everett charging Sir Robert Peel with a great error of fact in his late speech— Cushing wanted to have Everett’s Letter read at the Clerk’s table; but did not succeed: though Briggs moved a suspension of the rules to help him— Sundry bills were discussed in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— T. W. Gilmer in the chair and the harbour bill, was finally laid on the table by yeas and nays 107 to 87— John P. Kennedy communicated to me in confidence the original Letter from Henry Lee—Paris 24. August 1833. to Richard S. Brown, with permission to take a copy, but not for publication— The Revd. Mr Hawley, Mr and Mrs Morgan, and her mother paid us evening visits— "

James Gaither is a mechanic who has been employed as a carpenter, working on the public buildings, of the bureaux in the Navy Department, whose account is disputed by Dr Barton the chief of the medical and surgical bureau—he came with a petition, and his accounts, not knowing where to apply for redress— I entered his petition at the clerk’s office, and diverted its reference to the Committee on the expenditures of the Navy Department. Mr Gaither afterwards came up to the house, and I introduced him to Mr Thomas Jones Yorke the chairman of that Committee— Brown has a claim, which I had referred to a Committee some time since— He came to enquire of its state: He said he had seen in a newspaper that the Committee had reported in his favour— I promised to ascertain for him how it was, but in the multitude of other calls upon my attention, failed in the performance of this.— Besides Gaither’s petition I entered two others at the Clerk’s Office and directed their reference to the proper Committees.— Burche told me that he had entered my whole list of petitions on the Journal, and returned it to me— I took it to the Office of the National Intelligencer and gave it to Mr Gales who promised to publish it next Monday— At the house, the day began, with an hour speech of Mr John Pope on Joseph R. Ingersoll’s motion to print extra copies of the two reports from the Committee of Ways and Means, against the two hundred Millions of land-stocks to pay the State debts.— Pope is, as he has been all his life a man of halfway measures. He is of course against all measures devised by others, and teems with impracticable projects of his own— The river and harbour bill was debated sometime, and at last on motion by Cave Johnson laid on the table, yeas and nays 107 to 87. John Campbell worried the house into the consideration of his bill to suspend the single district Section of the apportionment act— A motion to lay the bill on the table 71 to 115. failed— The previous question, rushed to the passage of bill which was announced to be rejected 90 to 91.— Then followed a motion for reconsideration, finally rejected 93 to 100.— The contested election bill pocketed by Captain Tyler the last day of the last Session, was now crammed through, by the previous question and yeas and nays 105 to 82. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Fessenden in the chair on the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill—debate on striking out 1500 dollars for the President’s Secretary, which I opposed— Committee rose without coming to a conclusion— Evening visitors F.

Mr Daniel Whitaker, agent for the proprietors of the revived Southern Review, published at Charleston South-Carolina, came to solicit my subscription, and if agreeable, my contribution to it; both of which I declined— Mr Gurley came with a young man named Saunders, who keeps a small select classical school, and wished to have leave to refer to me as to its character and his qualifications— I have not yet learnt the art of gracious denial, and as they evidently thought harshly though far otherwise intended by me referred to my invariable rule of never giving recommendatory certificates or testimony, to persons or things of which I have no knowledge of my own— These visitors, and a call at the Bank of the Metropolis, retarded me a half an hour at the meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs, which I had called yesterday for this morning— Present Adams, Cushing, Everett Granger, Caruthers, Meriwether and Holmes— Absent Shepperd, indisposed, and Stuart, whom I had not been able yesterday to notify— He was absent from the house— Cushing had shewn me yesterday a confidential Letter with enclosures, to be communicated to me: urging as a wish of the President an appropriation for a special and extraordinary mission to Great Britain— There were militant resolutions of the Legislatures of Illinois and of Missouri, relating to the Territory of Oregon, upon which I took occasion to move an instruction to me to propose this amendment to the appropriation bill— Holmes, was very warmly for it—with Cushing and myself; But Everett and Granger peremptorily—Meriwether bitterly, and Caruthers with his bland and courteous smile all opposed it— The final decision was postponed till next Tuesday at 9. I offered two Resolutions against the annexation of Texas, upon which Holmes said he should at once pronounce his veto— At the house about two hours were consumed in a movement of Joseph L Williams to drive through a joint Resolution authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to pay 100000 dollars to contain claimants under a Cherokee Treaty—and he succeeded. John Campbell had found that the vote yesterday on the bill to suspend the single district Section of the apportionment bill had been not 90 and 91 as reported by the Clerk; but 91 and 91. and that there had been a mistake in counting Landaff W. Andrews’s vote in the negative, he not having voted at all, which he confirmed—but Campbell did not succeed in reversing the decision against his bill. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Fessenden in the chair on the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill, which was mangled, till the quorum was wasted away—and then rose without concluding— Adjourned near Evening visitors, as in the margin— Mr Murray lent me a London paper containing the debates on the meeting of Parliament.

Attended public worship at the Hall of the house of Representatives, where Mr Tiffany read a small part of the episcopal morning service and preached from Luke 15.22. [“]But the father said to his servants, bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.”— It is a perilous thing for a preacher in the English language, to take his text for a discourse from a chapter, and especially from a parable handled by Sterne— His Sermon upon this parable of the prodigal Son, has left an indelible impression upon my mind—and a sensible judicious discourse upon this story does but bring to mind the exquisite composition of pathos and of humour which Yorick brought to bear upon it— After the service I went into the Clerk’s Office, where I found Mr Burche and one or two of the subalterns— I enquired for a message from the President with sundry documents relating to memorials praying for the recognition of the republic of Hayti. The Message was received on the 31st. of December last and referred to the Committee of Foreign Affairs— It was in answer to a Resolution of the house of the 12th. of February 1841. calling for these documents— On search now made neither the message nor the documents could be found— Burche said they must be at the printers, and he would send for them to morrow morning. I went in to the Chamber of the Committee of foreign Affairs, and made up the minutes of the last two meetings of the Committee— After dinner the service, first for this Season at St. John’s Church began at 4 O’Clock— Yet, I was belated. Mr Hawley read the Evening prayers for Quinquagesima, on the Sunday before lent, and preached from Philippians 4.19. [“]But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.” After church I went over and passed half an hour with Mr Thomas B. Johnson who is partially recovering from his last paralytic shock, but is yet scarcely able to speak with distinct articulation, or to stand upon his feet.— I received an evening visit from Mr Starkweather a native of Massachusetts, settled in New-York, who said he had been some twenty-five years since, shortly after my last return from Europe introduced to me— He is a sound whig, and like others of that party absolutely desponding of public affairs. I never was so much so myself. The disappointment is bitter inasmuch as only two years since we had symptoms and expectations of better things— It seemed as if the People were becoming sober and rational— And benevolent—alas! for the recoild— We are now surrendeered to the wildest and foulest democracy— The only hope for the Country, in the divisions among themselves will I fear prove delusive— "

O’Clock this morning by a fit of coughing, after rising from bed, lighting my lamp and finding what was the hour I returned to bed and lay dosing till 7. I had prepared resolutions to be offered to the house with a view to call the attention of the people of the free States to the disproportion of slave-holding judges on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States—and an acrostic for the album of Miss Mary Jewett Morris— It is one of the grievous miseries of my life to be perpetually beset with albums, and for autographs with a few lines of poetry; with which having complied in a few instances heretofore, it has brought down upon me such a shower, or rather such a waterspout of applications that my ship sinks under them— At the house, the first hours were consumed in chicanery, by Hopkins, pettifogging about the error of the clerk in the count upon John Campbell’s palinodial bill to suspend that is to repeal his own single district section, of the apportionment bill— The Clerk had reported the count 90 to 91— It proved to have been 91 to 91—a tie, by which the bill was still lost— Campbell had already wasted time in a vain struggle to get the decision reversed— Hopkins this morning raked up the rule that in case of a tie the Speaker shall vote—upon which the Speaker said, he had no sort of objection— The chair votes in the negative— Briggs moved to print 3000 copies extra, of a post-Office report. Cave Johnson objected and snarled for half an hour but Briggs finally carried it— Toland moved for leave to the select committee on the removal of Jonathan Roberts to sit, during the Session of the house— W. W. Irwin a subaltern of the corporal’s guard, objected, and then parleyed, and jockeyed him out of the vote— Fillmore moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— I called for the regular order of the day— The call for Resolutions.— The house decided to go into Committee— I asked leave to present my Resolutions respecting the Slave-holding and free State judges on the bench of the Supreme Court. Multitudes of objections were heard. I asked a suspension of the rules and the yeas and nays— The Speaker said the house had voted to go into Committee, and my Resolutions were returned to me. I gave them to Stansbury to be published in the National Intelligencer.— The day was consumed in debate on the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— Fessenden in the chair— The Bill was at last reported by the house with many amendments, one of which introduced at my motion was an appropriation of 3000 dollars for a Commissioner to the Sandwich Islands.— Adjourned about 5 O’Clock. There was a Message received from the President in answer to the call moved by C. J. Ingersoll last week for the correspondence with the British Government relating to the right of visitation— The issue between Captain Tyler and Sir Robert Peel. "

Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs at 9: this morning— Present Adams, Cushing, Everett, Granger, Stuart, Shepperd, Caruthers, Meriwether, Holmes, the whole Committee— I presented again the motion that the chairman be instructed to move an amendment to the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill still under consideration of the house, an appropriation for a special minister to Great Britain— Cushing, Holmes and myself voted ay— Everett, Granger, Shepperd, Stuart, Caruthers and Meriwether voted nay— I then again presented two Resolutions to be reported to the house, on the reference of the Resolutions from the Legislature of Alabama, in favour of the annexation of Texas to this Union, and of sundry petitions against that measure— My first Resolution denying the Constitutional power of Congress, or of any Department or Departments of the Government of the United States to annex any foreign State or people to this Union; and the second, that any attempt by act of Congress or by Treaty to annex the Republic of Texas to this Union would be a violation of the Constitution, null and void, and to which the free States of the Union and their People ought not to submit— Meriwether moved as a substitute for my two resolutions an instruction to the chairman to ask to be discharged from the further consideration of the subject. Stuart, Shepperd Caruthers, Meriwether, Holmes and Cushing voted for the substitute— Everett and Granger against it—declaring their willingness to vote for the first of my two Resolutions— The vote was partizan sectional, except Cushing’s which was northern servile or doughface— In the house the first thing done was to pass a resolution to meet for the remainder of the Session at 10 O’Clock A.M— A great mass of business was transacted, in much of which I took part, but cannot even notice it here. J. P. Kennedy from the Committee of Commerce made a report upon our African Colonies— In to which I made some enquiries to be seriously followed up hereafter. R. M. Saunders from the judiciary reported a substitute trickery bill to naturalize David Levy, the Jew delegate from Florida by confirming under a mask an Ordinance of Andrew Jackson, annulled by Congress when first reported to them—at my motion the substitued bill was laid on the table— I asked from the Committee of foreign Affairs, the house to discharge them from the further consideration of the Texian Annexation Alabama Resolutions and the counter petitions.— And I offered my own two Resolutions—which were read. Wise objected, and they were not received.— The bill for executing the Ashburton Treaty was called up by Cushing; carried through the Committee of the whole, George W. Summers in the Chair, reported to the house, and passed by yeas and nays 137 to 40— Adjourned at a quarter past 5.— This evening a Virginian abolitionist named Joseph Bryant was here; but I have no room to record his sayings and doings "

Cost Johnson’s plan for creating two hundred millions of dollars of 3 per Cent Stocks hypothecated on the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, to be distributed among the States to relieve them in the payment of their debts— Present Johnson, Gentry, Cravens, Howard, Cooper, and Adams.— We were to meet at 9. but it was half an hour later before we formed a Quorum, and as the house met at 10. we had no time for discussion, nor even for reading the chairman’s report which was itself not finished.— We agreed to take some opportunity, while the house were in Session, to slip out of the hall, and meet again in the Committee room again which we did— Mr. Johnson’s report was not yet finished—but he read what he had written, and it was agreed that he should finish it, and present it to the house to-morrow— It is to conclude with two Resolutions— 1. That It is expedient that the Government of the Union should come to the aid of the States to assist them in the payment of their debts, by the application of their common property in the public lands— And 2. That a Committee be appointed to prepare a Bill, for that purpose— But foreseeing that the first resolution, if a question be taken upon it in the house will certainly be rejected,—I offered three Resolutions as a substitute for it in the event of its rejection. 1. That repudiation by a State of a debt contracted with foreigners is a violation of the Constitution of the United States in the Article which prohibits every State from passing any Law impairing the obligation of contracts. 2. That if any State shall by such repudiation involve herself in War, Congress has no power to involve the Nation in that War. 3. That if any State should involve herself in such a War, she would cease to be a State of this Union, and would have no claim to the aid of the other States of the Union for her defence— No objection was made to my introducing these resolutions as a substitute; but they startled every member of the Committee present, and evidently disconcerted Johnson— He had blinked the question of repudiation and War, without the preliminary settlement of which his project is mere moonshine. At the house amidst the usual confusion always incident to the last three days of a Session of Congress, specially aggravated by the last agonies of a Congress itself, the day was almost wholly consumed in unprofitable debate on the amendments proposed by the Senate to the navy appropriation bill; the merits and demerits of Dr Barton as chief of the medical, and surgical bureau, under the new organization of the Navy Department, and whether the chief of an other bureau should be a captain or a purser in the Navy. All the amendments of the Senate were acted upon in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union; Robert M’Lellan in the chair— Adjourned after 5. Evening visits from Mrs Seaton, with Mrs Hale, and her daughter— Also from Mr Leavitt who took leave, about to return to Boston. "

Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Present Adams, Everett, Granger, Stuart, Meriwether— We had the documents relating to the Republic of Hayti, and those relating to the occupation of Monterey by Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones before us— They had been sent for to the printers, and not one of them had been printed—although the Hayti Message had been referred to the Committee, on the 31st. of December, and the papers had been at the printers ever since.— I offered a Resolution upon each of these sets of papers to be reported to the house. That a Consul ought to be forthwith appointed to the Republic of Hayti, to prosecute the claims of our citizens; and a strong declaratory Resolution against the invasion of the territory of a foreign State at peace with the United States, by any military or naval officer; but there being a bare quorum at the meeting, the questions were postponed in the expectation of a fuller meeting to-morrow— Mr Everett also proposed two Resolutions respecting the right of visitation at sea for consideration to-morrow. At the house Reynolds of Illinois presented several impertinent resolutions of the Legislature of that State— Illinois is one of the bilking States, and Reynolds is one of her accredited cheats; and these States just as they grow bold in spunging their debts, they become profuse of their advice to Congress— Edward D. White of Louisiana, in his peculiar and somewhat ludicrous style, complained of having been personally insulted, by reflections upon the imputed disaffection of the people of Louisiana, at the time of the english invasion in 1815— Those imputations he said were utterly false, and he wanted to prove it—(W. O. Butler had charged them in his speech.) White asked that the house should immediately after the morning hour go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union to take up Senate Bill N. 12 to refund General Jackson’s fine— This was a spurt and came to nothing.— Winthrop called up the Resolutions appended to his report from the Committee of Commerce, on the oppression of coloured Seamen in Southern ports. Cave Johnson moved to lay the subject on the table yeas and nays 86 to 59.— A desperate struggle was made to recharter for ten years the District Banks—defeated by Cave Johnson, Atherton and Weller. W. Cost Johnson presented his report and resolutions, on the two hundred millions of stocks project, which were ordered to be printed— A desperate effort was made favoured by Johnson himself, to exclude from reception my resolutions offered as a substitute for the first of his— They failed to exclude them from reception; but by yeas and nays, 72 to 108. they refused to print them— I defeated a Bill of W. O. Butler from the Committee of military Affairs, to restore the 2d regiment of dragoons and much Artillery.— The Code for the Navy—reduction of postage, and the navy appropriation bill absorbed the time of the house till 7 in the Evening when sundry motions to adjourn, and a call of the house were rejected, and the adjournment at last carried by yeas and nays 89 to 76.

Close of the 27th Congress—  Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs.— Present Adams, Cushing, Everett, Granger, Shepperd, Caruthers, Meriwether— Absent Stuart and Holmes— Cushing was asked if he was ready to report upon the case of the Florida territorial bonds; and answered that he was not— Precisely so he did at the close of the last Session— Upon my Resolution that a Consul to the republic of Hayti, ought to be appointed the vote to lay it on the table was unanimous except my own— Everett, and Granger as well as Cushing voting in submission to the South— But my Resolution against the invasion of foreign territories by any naval or military Officer in time of Peace was voted for by every member present, except Caleb Cushing, who voted against it— Mr Everett offered his two resolutions concerning the right of visitation at sea; but they were laid on the table by the vote of all the members present except Everett and me— I asked Cushing if he was acting as an Executive Officer or as a member of the house— He smiled and answered in good humour that he did not know. The Committee adjourned without day— In the house, the chaos of a closing Congress was more than usually magnificent— The 16th joint rule of the two houses enjoining that no new bill shall be sent from one house to the other on the last three days of a Session, and the 17th. that no bill shall be sent to the President for his signature on the last day of a Session were suspended first for particular bills, and then without limitation.— Committees of conference on the civil and diplomatic and the Navy Appropriation Bills and some others were appointed, and adjusted sundry differences of details— Christopher H. Williams by dint of importunity got the house into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon a bill to divide the Country into two military divisions for the benefit of General Gaines, but the bill failed— Atherton was in the chair— The house took a recess from 4 to 6. O’Clock—and when the time for resuming the Session came Atherton and his gang attempted to transact business with less than half a Quorum—while Gwin was leaping like a dog at a sop suspended over his head, to get up Senate bill N 12 to refund the fine of General Jackson. He succeeded at last in getting a vote by yeas and nays, but the house refused 77 to 83 to take it up— Weller moved the vote of thanks to the Speaker Charles Brown in a huffy speech declared he would not vote for it. Pickens Charles J. Ingersoll, Wise and Cushing, voted for it from professed magnanimity— Wise after asking to be excused— T. F. Marshall asked to make a speech after midnight Not allowed. Adjourned without day at half past one A.M. leaving the Senate in Session, upon executive business. They sat till half past 2. and thrice rejected Wise and Cushing. "

Clear cold—  The scene has changed; but I yet find time neither for repose, nor for profitable occupation— A succession of visitors absorbed the day. First came George Brown, who informed me that he had received the appointment of commissioner to the Sandwich Islands— He told me that Edward Everett was appointed minister plenipotentiary to China— That Henry A. Wise was nominated three times to the Senate as Minister to France, and three times rejected. That Caleb Cushing, had been three times nominated Secretary of the Treasury with the same result, after which John C Spencer was nominated for Secretary of the Treasury, and confirmed by the majority of one vote— W. W. Irwin nominated chargé d’Affaires to Denmark was confirmed without much opposition— The vacancy in England by Edward Everett’s appointment to China, is the substitute for the special mission, which slumped through in the Committee of foreign affairs— It is the back door by which Webster skilfully secures to himself a safe retreat from the Tyler cabinet. If Everett declines the China Mission, Webster can take it himself.— William Claiborne the rattle-brained keeper of the Marshall house at Richmond, came and took leave; and shewed me several of his Letters of recommendation: Coll. Freeman of the Marine Corps came with a budget of grievance, but finding me engaged with others said he would call again on Monday— I met Mr Slade in the Street, as I was going to the Bank of the Metropolis— He spoke of the address to the people on the subject of Texas, which Mr Seth M. Gates, wished to leave with me, but finally took himself— Most of the other visitors came merely to take leave, save Lee and Tompkins, strangers, who came by the mere impulse of curiosity. Mr Briggs and Richard D. Davis came together. Connell was desponding. I had helped his bill for the relief of the heirs of Robert Fulton through the house, and he had sangwine hopes of its passage in the Senate—but its friends could not bring it up; though he says there were 30 members out of 50 ready to vote for it— Alexander Randall came for the trunk containing the papers of the late William Wirt; but while I was looking for the key, hurried away for fear of losing the 4. O’Clock Cars; saying he would come for it again— Day lost. "

Dr Ezra Stiles Ely formerly of Philadelphia, but now of some where in the State of Missouri; at once an aspirant to sanctity and hacknied in the ways of the world— In 1828 he prostituted his pulpit in Philadelphia, by presbyterian electioneering harangues to promote the election to the Presidency of Andrew Jackson, a recorded adulterer a duel murderer, and a ruffian blasphemer, but a pious and exemplary member of the presbyterian church— At that time, by Doctor Ely’s creed all the sins of orthodox presbyterians from the beginning of time, and all that are to come have been washed white in the blood of the lamb— A sin more or a sin less is of no account, when the atonement sweeps them all in one lump away.— Dr. Ely’s morning text was from Romans 10.11. [“]For the scripture saith, whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed”— The scripture quoted, he said was Isaiah 28.16. [“]he that believeth shall not make haste.” that is like persons who are ashamed— The whole sermon was an earnest and eloquent exhortation to the auditory, not to be ashamed of the belief in Christ— And there were many remarks on the nature of Faith, but without noticing its two fold meaning of mere belief and of fidelity— After the morning worship Mr Snelling called on me and I returned to him the Letter from Horace Mann the Secretary of the Massachusetts board of School commissioners which he had left with me, and in which he proposes a plan for the investment of the Smithsonian fund— Mr D. D. Barnard also called to take leave, intending to depart on his return home to Albany to-morrow.— This being the first Sunday in Lent, the communion was administered by Mr Hawley at St. John’s Church and there was no evening service there— I attended again at the 2d. Presbyterian church, where Dr. Ely preached from Titus 3.14. “And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses”—leaving out the remaining words of the verse—[“]that they be not unfruitful.” This was a very sensible and liberal discourse on the necessity of good works as the natural and universal result of faith, though of no avail whatever to salvation— The Doctor gave notice that he should preach again next Sunday morning and afternoon at the same church— His auditory this morning was very thin, but this afternoon the church was full, without being crowded— Four strangers in my pew— Evening visits from J. L. Kerr, ex-Senator from Maryland, and from R. D. Cutts. Mr Kerrs term has just expired and will not be renewed— "

Freeman of the Marine Corps, came this morning; and gave me a full exposition of the abusive treatment and persecution which he is suffering from Coll. Henderson the commandant of the corps— He believes it originated in a loan of money which Henderson obtained from him in 1834. and the payment of which he procrastinated and evaded till Freeman was obliged to demand it in a tone so peremptory and menacing that Henderson made the payment, and declared that all personal intercourse between them other than strictly official would thenceforward cease.— Two days after Freeman received an order, transferring him from Boston to Pensacola from the healthiest to the most unhealthy station of the service— To accomplish this petty tyranny Henderson got the numbers of the stations changed— And so feeble is the state of Freeman’s health that he has certificates from Dr Bigelow and another eminent physician at Boston that a summer residence in a Southern climate would imminently endanger his life— He has remonstrated against all this, first, with Henderson himself and afterwards with the Secretary of the Navy Upshur, with the result only of another transfer from Pensacola to Norfolk Virginia— He now asked my advice, as an old friend of his deceased wife’s father Rufus G. Amory and of his kinsman, the late Revd. Dr James Freeman.— I advised him to see Mr Webster, and to appeal directly to the President. I went to the Capitol; returned books to the house and Congress libraries, and brought home the Letters and papers left in my draw— Took at the document chamber the sheets of the house and Senate journals hitherto printed, and one or two spare documents— At the clerk’s office I enquired for the Resolution, which I reported from the Committee of foreign Affairs on the last Night of the Session, against the invasion of foreign territories by a military or naval officer, and which the house by yeas and naystorefused to suspend the rules to receive— It was mislaid and not to be found. I had received a note yesterday from the National Intelligencer Office requesting a copy of it, but I had none. I called at the office, where Mr Seaton gave me three Arkansas State Gazettes of 18 and 25 January and 1. February last containing the Sevier atchievements on the Smithsonian fund— This afternoon my neighbour Mr Parris called and invited me to spend this evening at his house with Mr John Holmes and his wife, a daughter of the late General Henry Knox, which I did. Mr Briggs had paid me a morning visit, with two young men, one named Colt, from Pittsfield, and the other M’Kay, a Grand Son of Samuel Dexter— A man named Elliot, from Harrisburg came to enquire about an appropriation for an agent at the Isthmus of Panama.

Freeman came again and read to me the Letters which he has prepared to the Secretary of the Navy and to the President upon his case— He said he had called upon Mr Webster, and had solicited the exercise of his influence in his favour— Mr Webster he said approved of his application to the President, and advised him to ask me to give him a Letter of introduction to the President. I will not indulge a suspicion of the motive which could have prompted Webster to give that advice; but I told Coll. Freeman, that he might say to Mr Webster, and if he chose to the President himself, that my personal relations with him since the close of the second Session of this Congress, as would not permit me to give to any one a Letter of introduction to him— I called at the Globe Office and settled there my bill for a complete set of the Congressional Globe and Appendix, the only poor substitute for the Register of Debates in Congress since the suspension of that of Gales and Seaton in 1837. There are ten Quarto Volumes: and that of the recent Session will not be completed they tell me till after midsummer— Mr Haas a German who takes Daguerrotype likenesses in the Pennsylvania avenue near the capitol had engaged me to come and sit to his Camera obscura and I went this afternoon— But Mr Haas said the morning would be a more favourable time and I promised to call again to-morrow before Noon— This Evening the Count de Menou came to thank me for the assistance I gave to effect the passage of the Bill for the relief of the heirs of Philip Francis Renaut— Though unsuccessful, and the bill was rejected the Count’s expressions of gratitude were as fervent and cordial as they could have been if we had succeeded— Mr Richard Rush was here last evening and took leave of us. The bill for his relief was more fortunate and was carried through— His grateful acknowledgments were also very gratifying to me, and he was very earnest in his invitation that on our return home we would stop at Philadelphia to spend a day with him and his family at Sydenham— "

V: Wednesday  The assortment and filing of my Letters which have been two months accumulating, some of them unread, occupies now about two hours of my time every day— Four hours, for the recording of two days in this Diary, to retrieve every day one of the arrears, gives as much writing as I can perform— The tide of visitors is subsiding, and the newspaper and pamphlet reading is not now overcharged as it was during the Session of Congress.—Mr James C. Adams, Secretary of the Baltimore Lyceum had written me a Letter from Brown’s hotel last evening, enquiring if I would deliver a Lecture before that institution; and he came this morning and renewed in person the invitation— I have no alternative, but to decline them all; and in every case it is a trial of temper to give a courteous negative answer. I walked this morning to Mr Haas’s shop, and he took from his camera obscura, three Daguerrotype likenesses of me— The operation is performed in half a minute; but is yet altogether incomprehensible to me. Mr Haas says it is a chemical process upon mercury, silver, gold and Iodine. It would seem as easy to stamp a fixed portrait from the reflection of a mirror; but how wonderful would that reflection itself be, if we were not familiarised to it from childhood.— I went to the Capitol, and on enquiry at the Clerk’s office, found that my resolution reported from the Committee of foreign Affairs in the night of the 3d. of March, but not received by the house, was recovered; a copy of it was furnished me, which I gave to Mr Gales for publication in the National Intelligencer— I met him in the Congress library.— There are no additional documents, or journals of the houses printed since Monday— The arrearages of printed Documents are enormous.— Those of the house even for the second Session of the recent Congress I am told will not be completed till next winter— Mr Danforth came again to enquire if I would deliver a Lecture at Alexandria— I definitively declined.— He asked me if I had heard Dr Ely at the second presbyterian church last Sunday; I said I had; and he intimated that perhaps the Doctor would incline to be permanently settled there— I received last evening a Letter from Charles J. Ingersoll at Philadelphia, reminding me of Letters received by me some months since from Dr Lamb of Frankford 6 miles from Philadelphia, inviting me to deliver a Lecture there— Charles was a strange correspondent to urge this invitation upon me; but I answered his Letter in all cordiality, and desired to be excused from delivering the Lecture— I wrote also to the Revd Obadiah B.

I received this morning a note from Mr Hagner requesting in behalf of Mr Alexander Randall the return of the trunk containing the papers of the late William Wirt which was accordingly done— It has been a year or more in my possession at the earnest request of Mrs Wirt, and her family to examine the papers and advise what portion of them should be published— A task which I have not been able to perform nor even to read more than a small part of an autobiography which I found very amusing. I regret very much being obliged now to give up the papers which are to be committed to Mr John P. Kennedy, for the same purpose. In looking over my papers I found several which required my attendance at the Departments of the Treasury and of War— I went first to the Treasury— The Secretary John C. Spencer, transferred from the War Department in the last hour of the late Congress after the thrice repeated rejection by the Senate of the nomination of Caleb Cushing, had taken possession of his new Office yesterday— He was to come in this day at 1. O’Clock— I returned to the chief clerk M’Clintock Young the Abstract of West-Florida claims, and the transcript of that of Joseph Mauro, which I had borrowed, for the illustration of David Levy’s bill, and which defeated it— I enquired if application had been made at the Department in behalf of Joshua Drew of Duxbury, for payment of the sum of 240 dollars granted for his relief by an act of the recent Session. No such application has been made, and I wrote to inform him that the act has passed— I had received a Letter from John Ford making enquiries concerning a supposed claim of Elisha Sprague of Marshfield deceased of indemnity for property destroyed by the Seminole Indians but not a trace of the claim could be found at the Department— I had taken Treasury Notes redeemable this and the past days since the 3d. but Mr Young informed me that they would be payable on the 1st. of July next at the merchant’s Bank in Boston, and I concluded to keep them for the present— Mr Young informed me that from 1. Jany. 1842 inclusive, no interest has been paid on the Smithsonian-Arkansas bonds—except about 4500 dollars, which came to the credit of that State, as her portion of the proceeds of the Sales of the public Lands— I went to the War Department and found there Mr Spencer, with his successor James Madison Porter, just installed as Secretary of War, in his place— I returned with Mr Spencer to his Office, and had a long conversation with him respecting the condition of the Smithsonian fund— Mr Hassler, and Mr Choate with Mr Davis here this Evening.

Fahrenheit 35— Small rain all day—  In the unceasing mill clapper talk of Mr Hassler last evening, he asked me to introduce him to the new Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer which I agreed to do, and appointed this day at one O’Clock to go with him to the Department for that purpose— He came and we went accordingly— I introduced him, and almost immediately left them together; but not without perceiving the seeds of a conflict already germinating between two proud spirits, which bodes no good to the progress of the Coast Survey.— The recent act places Hassler under the controul of a board of Officers; and the whole operation under the superintendence of the Secretary of the Treasury— Hassler, already restive under the yoke fitting to his neck, said that the work being scientific must be conducted on scientific principles— The potentate answered in a subdued tone of voice but with the trenchant stubbornness of authority the Laws must be obeyed— The pride of Science clashed with the pride of place, and I left them together.— I had observed the same temper in Spencer yesterday in talking with him about the present condition and prospects of the Smithsonian fund— I supplicated him to take an interest in the restoration, preservation and application of the fund to the purposes of the testator— He promised to make a full report to Congress on the subject—to recommend the issue of 6 per Cent stock of the United States to the full amount of the dilapidated funds and the investment of it in trustees— The Chief Justice of the United States and other Officers of the Government— But he thought the disposal of the funds should be left entirely to the Trustees, and he pronounced the prejudices against my plan of an astronimical observatory insurmountable because I had once called observatories, light houses in the skies— My words were light-houses of the skies, but Mr Spencer sees no difference between the two phrases— Mr Spencer turned up his eyes at the swindling speculation of the Senator from Arkansas, and shruged up his shoulders at the prospect of ever recovering the money from that State— I spent much of this day in transiently reading the report of the trial in the Supreme Court of the United States of the case of Edward Prigg against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania—otherwise called the fugitive slave case— Seven judges—every one of them dissenting from the reasoning of all the rest, and every one of them coming to the same conclusion: the transcendent omnipotence of Slavery in these United States, riveted by a clause in the Constitution that persons held to labour, escaping from one State to another shall be delivered up on the claim of the person to whom the labour is due— David Lee Child and Richard D. Cutts in succession, occupied the hours of this Evening. "

I had neglected to have the mortgage Deed recorded within six months from its date as the law here requires— Day before yesterday I wrote to Mr Brown, enquiring, if I might expect payment this day— Yesterday I received his answer, promising to pay the interest, but asking further indulgence for the principal— I had engaged Major C. J. Nourse to procure for me a Cincinnati 6 per cent bond for 1000 dollars at 83 1/2 per cent and he came this morning to inform me that it would be delivered to me next Wednesday, to come from Philadelphia; but it was to be paid for this day— I therefore applied at the Treasury Department for repayment of two Treasury Notes of 500 dollars each, due on the 8th. of this month— The treasurer referred me to the Bank of the Metropolis, where they took my two Notes and gave me a credit of 1060 dollars and 49 cents— I then gave Major Nourse two checks—one for 835 dollars for the Cincinnati bond which he is to deliver to me next Wednesday, and one for 221.25 for which he is to deliver to me a city corporation note of 250 dollars— Upon all which I remark my own indiscretion in making the payments before the delivery of the stocks— An experiment somewhat hazardous, and not to be repeated— Upon my file of Letters which I am assorting I found two relating to Post Offices which required answers. One from Jesse Murdoch of Carver; and the other from John E. Boyden, an aspirant for a Post-Office at South Dedham— I took them to the general Post-Office— The Postmaster General Wickliffe was gone to escort homeward his Son, recently married to a daughter of Dawson the amiable bully from Louisiana— The first Assistant Postmaster General Hobbie was also absent. But Mr Whittlesey the auditor was there, and the second Assistant Postmaster General Bryant, whom I informed that Mr Murdoch’s Letter, recommended Samuel E. Shurtleff, for the appointment of Postmaster at Carver— Mr Bryant exhibited to me the papers in the Office relating to the application for an Office at South Dedham— There were two Letters from the Revd. Calvin Durfee of that place, one to me and one to his uncle Benjamin Tappan, Senator from Ohio, remonstrating against a new Office at South Dedham, because it would require the discontinuance of the existing Office at East-Walpole— I took the mortgage deed of Obadiah B. Brown to the City Hall and left it at the Register’s Office to be recorded— William Brent said there was an act of Congress remedying the laches of a record not made within the six Months— Call at Haas’s shop and took the Daguerrotype likeness of me—a very good one— At the House Clerk’s Office in the Capitol— No further Documents or journals printed— Mr O. B. Brown came this afternoon and paid me a year’s interest on his note, and for recording the mortgage.— And hopes to pay the note itself before midsummer. "

                "text": "12. VI. Sunday.  Fahrenheit 32— Snow.  I attended morning and afternoon at the second Presbyterian church and heard Dr Ezra Stiles Ely— His morning text was from Hebrews 5.9. “And being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” This verse is in one of the most obscure and mysterious chapters of all the writings of St. Paul—if indeed which I much doubt the epistle to the hebrews was written by St. Paul— The allusions to Christ as a Priest forever after the order of Melchisedek—are utterly unintelligible to me— The quotation is from Psalm 110.4. a reference to which furnishes no elucidation. Dr Ely however took no notice of the context, but descanted largely upon the complicated humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ, a theme with which the most learned and accomplished gospel polemic never meddles but he finds no evil, in wandering mazes lost.— The Doctor’s afternoon text was from Proverbs 11.30.—“and he that winneth souls is wise[”]—omitting the first clause of the verse— The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life— He said that the word winneth implied the natural depravity of mankind; for it must be some wickedness or evil propensity from which the soul was to be won.—and then he discoursed upon the wisdom to be exercised in winning souls from the errors of their ways— Now came the atonement, and a slight touch at the doctrine of universal Salvation— He said he had not so read his bible.— And he undertook to declare with undoubting confidence, how the righteous on earth will meet and recognize and enjoy the Society of their old acquaintances in heaven—a pretension rather presumptuous.— The Doctor’s manner of preaching is agreeable— Without notes— In the style of familiar conversation— Not at all ambitious of oratory, without figurative ornaments— Argumentative—earnest—copious, without superfluity of words.—calmly eloquent, but never transporting—nor transported— The house as on the last Sunday was very thin on the morning, but well filled in the afternoon— He had been desired to request the members of the congregation to remain a few minutes after the service, which they did—at this meeting Mr M’Lellan proposed that Dr. Ely should be invited to settle as the Pastor of the Church.— It met with general assent, and a committee of 3 members was appointed to confer with him on the subject— If they can agree with him, notice is to be given at the Church next Sunday that an election of a Pastor will be held in the course of the then ensuing week. The Doctor is weary of Missouri, and peradventure Missouri is weary of him. Stephen D. Smith and passed Midshipman Joseph H Adams dined with us, and Richard D. Cutts, and his Sister Mary were here at tea. "

Freeman came this morning, under great excitement— He had not been able to see the President, but had received this morning from the Secretary of the Navy Abel P. Upshur an order in the harshest official style, saying that no change will be made in the stations of the Officers of the marine Corps—commanding him to repair to his Post at Norfolk and adding that at the end of the month he might renew his application for leave of absence if he saw fit. The Coll. has certificates from Doctors Bigelow and Jeffries of Boston and Dr Thompson of Charlestown would endanger his life, and he thinks there is personal malevolence against him among the motives of the Secretary: he says that was the impression upon Richard Peters who undertook as Freeman’s friend to expostulate with the Secretary in his favour.— The Colonel intimated that he might take his own leisure as to the time when he would go to Norfolk, and in the meantime would urge earnestly his appeal to the President— I advised him to be very cautious to do nothing that might be construed into a breach of discipline, remarking that the slightest colour of that, would be seized with avidity and turned against him. I promised to call immediately upon Mr Webster, and endeavour to obtain his influence to mitigate the prejudices against him— I went accordingly forthwith to the Department of State and saw Mr Webster— I returned to him a confidential despatch which he had lent me in January last; from Edward Everett, dated in November 1842 immediately after the reception in England of the News of the Peace with China— And I said I had been much gratified with the appointment of Edward Everett as the Minister to China; deeming the mission of transcendent importance, and deeming him by his character and attainments peculiarly well suited for such a mission— Mr Webster appeared to be much delighted, and they appeared to be quite unexpected— He immediately said he would be greatly obliged to me, if I would write as much to Edward Everett himself, which I said I would do with pleasure— He asked me to send the Letter to him to-morrow, when the despatches would be made up to go by the Great Western, next Thursday. though her arrival at New-York is not yet known— After this I spoke to him of the complaint of Coll Freeman and intreated him to take an interest in it, so far as to obtain relief for him if possible; which he promised with apparent cordiality— He said he would speak this evening to Mr Upshur and to-morrow morning to the President, but it will be to no purpose— Coll. Freeman was here again this afternoon and said he should go for Norfolk to-morrow.— Dr Thomas paid us a visit, and Dr Frye dined with us— "

Fahrenheit 20—  A religious Monomaniac by the name of Miller has been preaching and lecturing and prophesying the second advent of Christ and the end of the world or otherwise the kingdom of the Saints for many months, and as such insanities are always infectious, he has frightened multitudes, some to convulsions and death, others into piety and penitence—and many to uneasiness of mind more or less disguised— The first prediction was that the general conflagration would kindle on the 23d. of April of this present year— As the day approaches he has become less precise in the indication of time, and announces the Catastrophe, as to be consummated on or within one year from that day.— To quicken the sensation of alarm, within the last fortnight, the portentous tail of a Comet, some sixty degrees in length, has swept the South western horizon, every clear evening after the setting of the sun— The nucleus has been here hidden behind the disk of that luminary, and has not been seen, though paragraphs of distant newspapers aver that it has been seen in broad day, near the sun, and in brightness equal to that of the planet Venus— My obstinate and inexorable catarrh awoke me this morning before 3. and delayed my rising hour till 6— The day was one of uninterrupted leisure and yet of no performance— I wrote last a Letter to Edward Everett to persuade him to accept the mission to China and sent the Letter this day to the Department of State.— I read the Message of the President to the Senate of 24. Feby last in answer to two of their Resolutions, calling for the correspondence relating to the Quintuple Treaty, on the 13th. of June 1842 The house of Representatives at my motion adopted a similar Resolution, including a copy of the Treaty—on the 20th. of that same month John Tyler answered the Resolution, refusing the correspondence at that time, declaring a hope and expectation that he will find it convenient to communicate it at an early day; and containing these words—“In answer to this request, I have to say that the treaty mentioned therein has not been officially communicated to the Government of the United States, and no authentic copy of it, therefore can be furnished”— In this present message to the Senate the first Document is a Letter from Daniel Webster to Cass, dated 5. April 1842 in which he says—the President has been closely attentive to recent occurrences in Europe connected with the treaty of the five powers, of which we received a copy soon after its signature in December— Is there an escroc in a penitentiary who could match that for prevarication? The correspondence between Webster and Cass is tart and curious enough— Guizot’s Letter in answer to Cass’s absurd protest is a chef d’oeuvre— I walked to the Office of the National Intelligencer and held some conversation with Mr Seaton— Whiled away much of the day in assorting papers— "

Wednesday  Another restless, hacking, racking night— I awoke coughing before 3 this morning, and lay till a quarter past 4. without sleeping and impatient to rise; but for an idle and drowsy day. I walked to the shop of Mr Haas where I found a young man with two ladies his wife and her companion whose likenesses he took in a group while I was there— He attempted also to take me, but did not succeed, because he said there was too much light of the Sun; and I promised to come again to morrow or the first fair day between 8 and 9 of the morning. I went to the document room, and Clerk’s Office of the House of Representatives, and found a few additional documents, of which I took some, but the printing both of journals of the recent Session is enormously in arrear; and the House Documents even of the Session before the last will not be completed for months— The two reports from the Committee of Commerce, on the treatment of coloured mariners in our Southern ports are at last delivered, and I addressed and despatched about 40 of them to friends in the late 12th and present 8th. congressional district of Massachusetts— The correspondence about the quintuple Treaty and the right of search.; has at once amused and provoked me not a little.— Its illustration of character, is admirable— Cass’s protest of 13. Feby 1842. against the ratification by France of the Treaty signed and sealed by her own Ambassador, is a compound of yankee cunning, of Italian perfidy and of French legeraté cemented by shameless profligacy unparalleled in American diplomacy— Tyler’s approval of it is at once dishonest, mean, insincere, and hollow-hearted— Cass’s correspondence with Webster, is insolent, inconsistent, sophistical, and prevaricating; and Guizot’s answer of 26. May, to his protest of 13. Feby. is not only a complete refutation of its absurd assumptions, but a most contemptuous exposure of its glaring falsehood— It is a silent but not the less severe rebuke upon President Tyler’s approval of this preposterous counterfeit of a State paper.— It is wretchedly printed in the official document, and still worse translated— Coming home I met judge Henry Baldwin of the U.S. supreme Court who told me that he just came from my house where he had called to pay a visit before returning home— The Court closed their annual Session yesterday; and this afternoon Henry Young the Crier of the Court came to beg two dollars to save him from starving.— Mrs Thornton and Mrs Talbot spent part of the Evening here, and Mrs Goods’s daughter Mitchell with her husband was burnt out; the second time within a week and the third time within two years— I answered Revd. E. W. Davies of Dayton Ohio, with copies of the Sanwich Island and China Documents, and a second Letter from James B. Murray asking the return of the Mississippi Bond. "

Deep Snow—  The progress of my Catarrh continues with increasing severity— After a foot bath last evening, I was roused from sleep before 3 this morning, by a fit of coughing, and after rising for about ten minutes returned to bed but not to rest till after 5— According to promise I walked up to Mr Haas’s shop about 9. my hands in woolen lined gloves, bitterly pinched with cold. found Horace Everett there, for the same purpose of being fac simileed. Haas took him once, and then with his consent took me three times—the second of which he said was very good—for the operation is delicate: subject to many imperceptible accidents; and fails at least twice out of three times.— I then left them and walked to the Capitol, a flake of snow falling here and there as I went. My first visit was to the office of the Secretary of the Senate—Dickins was not there, but Hickey was.— I asked to see the manuscript documents of the Message to the Senate concerning the Quintuple Treaty—especially the copy of Guizot’s Letter to Cass of 26. May 1842— I found that some of the errors in the printed copy were not in the manuscript; but other evident errors were— But the greatest and most disreputable errors were in the translation. I pointed them all out to Hickey who said they must have the document printed over again—but even that will not cover the shame of the false translation— From the Secratariat of the Senate, I went into the Congress library and returned the first volume of Peter Pindar, which I had borrowed—and I found there two other books charged to me; for which I must account— Thence I went into the military Committee room of the Senate where I found J. M. Edwards, another Daguerrotype likeness taker. I had received last evening a note from him, requesting me to come this day or to morrow between 9 and 3, as he wanted my likeness for a large picture of the Senate chamber, which he has projected and in which the Senators, judges of the Supreme Court, the President, and his Cabinet and others may all be assembled— But it was now snowing apace— Mr Edwards said he could not take my likeness this day, but asked if I could not stop to be taken at New-York on my way home. I declined, and on inspecting many samples of the faces he had taken, I was glad to be released from being taken by him at all. I travelled through the driving snow to the Office of the National Intelligencer, where I saw Mr Gales, and advised him to print in his paper the Letter from Guizot to Cass, correctly from the original I asked him also for the Intelligencer of the 11th containing Cushing’s speech on the execution of the Ashburton Treaty, to which is annexed a copy of the Quintuple Treaty—which he gave me.

The Snow fell, about one foot deep on the level and drifted in many places to be four feet deep, so that with my cough upon me, I was confined to the house the whole day. Coll. Freeman whom I had met yesterday in the Street, and who then told me that he was coming to me again upon his affairs came according this morning and stated his purposes— He said that Mr Webster had brought the matter before the cabinet, though apparently without success— His own explanations had been with Fletcher Webster, the Secretary’s Son and Chief Clerk, who course has reported all the statements to his father—but the Coll. has no relaxation from his order to repair to his post at Norfolk— He read to me what he proposed to write as his final reply to the Secretary of the Navy; and then his last appeal to the President— He proposes then to go to Norfolk—remain there till the end of this month— Then to renew the demand to be restored to the post at Boston, and to return there without waiting for further orders— I advised him not to do that, but to wait for the President’s answer to his appeal, and if that should be against him to remain at Norfolk two or three months till the approach of the sickly season, and then to renew the application for removal to a northern station— I advised him also to leave out of his applications to the Secretary of the Navy and to the President every word that could possibly deemed disrespectful— He served in the Constitution frigate in the last War with Great-Britain; with Bainbridge at the capture of the Java, and with Stuart at the taking of the Levant and Cyane.—  I have at last constituted myself a sick man, and sent for Doctor Thomas Last night, as the Night before I was twice roused from bed before the time of rising for the day, and the oppression of my cough on the lungs has become insupportable. The Doctor came and prescribed for this Night— I keep my chamber, and all my plans of studious labour, are indefinitely postponed— I read the strange Speech of John C. Clark on the Bill appropriating 40000 dollars, for establishing a diplomatic intercourse with China; which is an invective of wormwood and gall against the Secretary of State— He has published it in a pamphlet, and it had long been studiously devised— The charges against him are stale and hacknied. His Treachery to the whig party, in refusing to resign with the other members of the Harrison Cabinet in August 1841.— His adhesion to Tyler, and jobbing with him for re-election, with a condition that Tyler should support him for the succession, but above all the Faneuil Hall Speech, were the irremissible sins, for which Mr Clarke administers this castigation.— I thought it in bad taste when delivered— It reads to me now inexpressibly flat stale and unprofitable— Clark is a New-York Politician of the Clinton and Livingston school—in comparison with that of John Jay, ratsbane to ambrosia— Walter Hellen was here this evening.— I had laid out for myself steady and I hoped useful occupation till the advance of the spring shall call us home for the summer—but I am now annihilated for labour morning and evening, and have no power to apply to my condition any faculty of more active energy than Patience and resignation.

It is difficult to contemplate the infirmities of our physical nature philosophically— Every thing about sickness is odious to the sufferer and annoying to those around him— There is a consolation in the kindness of nursing friends; but the primary grief and self-reproach to me is the loss of time— I am idle— As the hours pass in succession I know, I might be working— I brood over projected labours and never commence working— As morning dawns, I have a long day before me, and think I shall use it to some good purpose— It slips away, I know not how— Approaching midnight summons me to repose—and I have lost a day.  The globe of earth has not space for the surface of Empires over which I should be worthy to rule if I could proclaim the record of my lost days. Mr Matthew St. Clair Clark came to visit me, but I was accidently not informed of it, and did not see him. After tea, and a game of back-gammon, with Louisa, and a rubber at whist with the three generations. Mr David Lee Child came in and spent the evening with me till past 11. He brought with him and shewed me an extract of a Letter in Spanish from a Mexican Commissioner; at La Guayra, on his way to attend a meeting of Envoys from the South American Governments and Mexico, to be held at Lima in Peru; and of which I had never before heard— The Letter is addressed to General Almonte, this Mexican Minister here, who gave the extract to Child to use it, as he might think proper. Almonte had caused to be printed here at the commencement of the last Session of Congress two pamphlets, one containing the spicy correspondence between the United States and Mexico from 12. May to 10 September 1842. and the other entitled Texas, consisting of extracts from my address at Braintree, of 17. Septr. 1842, with translations of the same into French and Spanish— The Letter from La Guayra, acknowledges the receipt of this last pamphlet; speaks of the address in terms of high commendation, and says he will transmit it to the principal cities of the several South American Republics for circulation there— Childs further told me, that in the month of January last, Webster actually proposed to Almonte a cession to the United States by Mexico of a portion of territory on the pacific Ocean, including the Port of San Francisco: so as to allow the British Government to stretch their territory down to the mouth of the Columbia river.— This is a ray of light—serving to explain Webster’s desire that Edward Everett should go to China, and he himself to England. Child says Almonte told him that Mexico had no disposition to part with any portion of her territory.— Webster’s political profligacy is gigantic. "

The time has been, chiefly in foreign countries when I have too long intermitted the duty of that attendance— Of this I charge myself especially when in Holland, in Berlin, in St. Petersburg, and last in France— I have lost by it rich opportunities of obtaining instruction; not only religious, but worldly, moral, political, intellectual— For this I blame myself; but the importance of regular attendance upon the duties of the Christian Sabbath in social communion has impressed itself more deeply on my mind in proportion as I have advanced in years.— I had neglected to become a member of the church, till after the decease of my father—another omission which I now regret I have at all times been a sincere believer in the existence of a supreme creator of the world, of an immortal principle within myself responsible to that creator for my conduct upon earth; and of the divine mission of the crucified saviour, proclaiming immortal life and preaching peace on earth, good will to men, the natural equality of all mankind, and the Law, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself— Of all these articles of faith, all resting upon the first, the existence of an omnipotent Spirit, I entertain involuntary and agonizing doubts, which I can neither silence nor expel, and against which I need for my own comfort to be fortified and sustained, by stated and frequent opportunities of receiving religious admonition and instruction— I feel myself to be a frequent sinner before God; and I need to be often admonished of it and exhorted to virtue. This is administered in all the forms of Christian worship, and I am sure of receive it with whatever denomination of Christian worshippers I associate to obtain it— Of late years I have deemed it my duty to attend the weekly morning performances of the Chaplains of Congress in the Hall of the House of Represenentatives; and I hold pews at St John’s episcopal church and at the second Presbyterian church, at which I attend alternately when Congress are not in session, and in the afternoon when they are— This forms a regular portion of my habits of life, and I cannot feel the privation of it without painful sensibility— My time hung heavy upon my hands. Joseph H. Adams dined with us and Richard D Cutts was here in the afternoon.— After tea my granddaughter Mary Louisa read to me some pages in Plutarch’s Life of Pericles, and some pages in Virgil Maxcy’s life of John C. Calhoun— The contrast between an antient, and a modern Statesman— I have also been reading a melancholy but very ingenious lecture delivered by Ezekiel Bacon before a Society of young men in New-York State, Utica entitled Recollections of Fifty years Since.

In a debate in the British house of PeersFeby 1843. upon the Queen’s speech, the Duke of Wellington spoke of the War and its origin. In answer to the Marquis of Lansdown he said; [“]I beg the noble marquis to recollect that I was almost the only individual in this house who stated that the real ground of complaint against the Chinese government was its conduct towards persons employed in the service of her majesty and representing her majesty, upon the occasion when a motion upon the subject was made by my noble friend near me. I was almost the only person in the house who defended her majesty’s servants in China, and I say the war was a just and a proper one on the part of her majesty’s government. (Cheers.) I go further and I say, that if it had been a War solely on the score of the robbery of the Opium, finding that her majesty’s Government was engaged in that War, and finding that the interest, and honour of the country were involved in that war, I should have considered it my duty, to make every effort to carry it on with the best means.”  My distempered, secluded and confined condition has left me no interesting occurrences for the materials of a Diary record, and despondency creeping over me threatens the disruption of this journal to be resumed only when my unclouded reason shall return to me by the will of the supreme disposer. The above extract from a Speech of the Duke of Wellington I have copied to keep on hand, in defence of my roughly handled Lecture of Novr. 1841. on the War between Great Britain and China— This day I find in a subsequent number of Niles Register, that of last Saturday Reports of a Speech of Lord Brougham on the Right of Search and our abortive Treaty with England of 1824—and of long debates in the French Legislative chambers recently resumed on the right of Search, between France and England; their treaties of 1831 and 1833, and the quintuple Treaty of 20 December 1841. yet unratified by France— There is much matter for curious observation and grave meditation on these recent controversies relating to the right of visitation and of search— Would it not be well to enquire into the right of maritime visitation and search, 1. by the Law of Nature? 2. by the practice of Antient Nations and as modified by the practice of piracy 3. By the practices of modern Nations, as modified by the doctrine of the mere clausum— 4. The new question started by the Negotiations of Great Britain to obtain the right the right of search for the suppression of the African Slave trade— 5. To mark the mistakes of both parties in precision of ideas bearing on the subject 6. The motives to dissension 7. The pretexts for opposition. 8 the political bearings of the subject— I received also this day a Letter from R. G. Beasley, at Havre 24 Jany 1843. with a pamphlet, to decry the English emancipation of Slaves, by its results, published by Jollivet, a member of the French chamber of deputies, from Martinique— Mrs Cutts here at tea— Whist— "

Still confined to the house, and under medical discipline Having undertaken to produce a general perspiration last night, by a warm foot bath followed by three successive doses of antimonial wine and nitre taken through the Night at two hours distance from each other— It was a failure— Heat was produced but no perspiration— The heat passed off, and I remain with a loaded stomach but without fever— Mr Root of West Springfield and Mr Howard of New-York were morning visitors—Strangers— Merely wishing to see me— And judge Cranch, my cousin my boy companion, school and college mate and friend, came to compare notes of decrepitude between us.— The judge is my junior by two years, but suffers by the infirmity of years still more than I, and the sight of him is one of those admonitions which multiply upon me, and which I struggle in vain to discard— The controversy between Lewis Cass and Daniel Webster, about the Ashburton Treaty, the rights of visitation and of search and the Quintuple Treaty, still with the comet, the zodiacal light and the Millerite prediction of the second advent of Christ, and the end of the world within five weeks from this day continue to absorb much of the public and of my attention.— The intelligencer of this day announces another Letter from Cass to Webster who in his last Letter declares the correspondence closed— This strange correspondence— The debates in the French Legislative chambers, and in both houses of the British Parliament and in both houses of Congress but especially in the Senate— This Slave trade and right of search complicated with the quintuple Treaty, with Texas—Mexico, California, Oregon, and the next Presidential election, breed teeming fancies in my brain till I grope to find my way out of the thicket— I looked up this afternoon J. C. Calhoun’s 3. Resolutions of the U.S. Senate of 4. March 15. April 1840. the preposterous claims of indemnity for the liberated slaves of the Enterprize—voted unanimously by 22 slave breeders and 11 craven democrats—with 15 more craven spirits absent, skulking from the questions upon which they dared not vote either yea or nay. I looked also into Ward and Vattel to ascertain the right of visitation and search upon the Ocean.— The right of visitation is by the Law of Nature, an intercourse of mutual benefit, like that of strangers meeting in a wilderness— The right of search is for pirates in peace and for enemies in War— But I must look into the Mare Clausum and the Mare liberum. The right of property in the Ocean and upon the shores— Its extent and its limitations— And especially remember that—the present disputes about the right of search are all now questions all originating in the measures devised by the British Government for the suppression of the Slave trade— Night coming on arrested me in my consultations of Ward and Vattel, and in my search to trace the fortune of the claim for indemnity for the slaves of the Enterprize, from its belligerent claim by Calhoun in March 1840 to its tacit surrender, merged in the Negotiations of the Ashburton Treaty, and the more critical case of the Creole— Dr Thomas was here this Evening.

Wednesday  The progress of my disease is obviously much affected by the various changes of the atmosphere— A week of confinement to the house I have already endured— On Thursday the 16th. I walked to the Capitol for exercise, my practice of which has for the last year or more been too much remitted.— Much, as I believe to the impairing of my health— I walked from the Capitol to the National Intelligencer Office, and afterwards thence home, last Thursday, through the severest Snow-storm that has been witnessed here, for perhaps seven years— Having then upon me a racking catarrh of several weeks standing. I have been confined from that day to the house: against my own will, for I should have preferred to be two or three hours of every day abroad, and the average of the weather has marked the temperature of January rather than that of March.— Last Night, and this day it had become milder, and was approaching the spring like; the masses of drifted snow in the Streets gradually settling into puddles, till about noon; when a sudden turn brought back the Northwester with another flight of snow; and then a clear sky, a bright Moon, a brisk gale, and a hard frost. I still keep house. Coll. Freeman was again here this morning.— He has sent his Letters to the Secretary of the Navy Upshur, and to the President—but has no answer from either— He would have gone for Norfolk yesterday—but the Steamer was detained and will not go till Friday. Lieutenant Thom of the topographical engineers, one of the young acquaintances of my nephew Isaac Hull spent the Evening with us—quite a pleasant young man— I re-examined the correspondence of Stevenson and Lord Palmerston, on the cases of the Comet, Enterprise and Encomium—leaving much more for persevering enquiry—and the whole enquiry shaped and methodised for a result— The same as to the project for refunding Andrew Jackson’s fine— An outrage upon Law, Justice, humanity, and all the principles of freedom, defeated in the last Congress and to be perpetrated in the next.— I reviewed also the two Volumes of Documents relating to Texas and Mexico—with reference to the late invasion of California, to the defeated bill for the occupation of the Territory of Oregon, and to the future Negotiations with England—upon all which I have much to learn, to do, and to suffer, to discharge the remainder of my duties upon earth— I took up too, the life of John C. Calhoun, by Virgil Maxcy, and Robert M. T. Hunter, just published, to puff him up into the line of Candidates for the Presidency— If the devil should incline to be set up as a candidate for the quadrennial chair, I would advise him to employ Virgil Maxcy and Robert M. T. Hunter to write his life— John C. Calhoun—President of the United States!— He is fit only to clean the boots of Thomas H. Benton in Pandemonium, after one of their pigmy transformations. Wanting some whipd syllabub information about Mexico, I asked Mary to borrow for me the two Volumes of Life in Mexico, recently published by Madame Calderon de la Barca. "

Another Letter from Lewis Cass to Daniel Webster, about the Ashburton Treaty, the right of visitation and search, and the offended dignity of the aforesaid Lewis Cass at the Lordly tone assumed by the Secretary of State in the previous part of this correspondence— I am thinking if there is any thing parallel to this correspondence in our diplomatic history. Silas Deane came home from France and made a rumpus (that word is not in Webster’s Dictionary—what a pity!) for several years; blew up a flame which kept this union long in a phease (another Websterless word) and has left a large claim of his heirs and legal representatives, against the United States of which not a dollar is due, but which on some lucky day they will recover— Mr James Monroe was recalled by President Washington, through Timothy Pickering, wire worked by Alexander Hamilton— Mr Monroe published a volume of his correspondence—against the administration of Washington by whom he had been appointed and recalled—which book largely contributed to the fall of Washington’s Administration as continued by his successor— It helped to bring in the Jefferson Administration, which laid the foundation for the dissolution of the Union. Cass and Webster are both New-Hampshire adventurers, who have made their way in the world, by mere dint of talents, Figaro fashion, making a trade of politics, and a Lottery prize of their Country— Cass has got along by a series of Executive appointments, from Marshal of Ohio in March 1807 and 11. Colonel and Brigadier General in 1813. Governor of Michigan in 1814 and continued untill appointed Secretary of War in 1833 and Minister to France in 1836. While Governor of Michigan, by successful land jobbing he is said to have realized a fortune of more than 800000 dollars, which on the occasion of his mission to France he withdrew from the falling chances of speculation, and which has enabled him to live in France in the Style of an Ambassador, and to ingratiate himself with Louis Philippe, which he had done by servile sycophancy till this protest of 13. Feby. a perfect Joab-like stab under the 5th rib, as perfidious towards Louis Philippe and his Minister Guizot, as it was rash and desperate, with regard to his own Country, and hollow-hearted and treacherous as a man.— Webster too has the soul and manners of a parvenu. In this controversy Cass is outrageously wrong from beginning to end: but in permitting Tyler to approve Cass’s protest, Webster put into Cass’s hand a scourge which Cass now plies against him with merciless dexterity.— The fragment end of the 6th column of the National Intelligencer is a short note from Webster to Cass repelling an imputation that he had reserved his fire till after Cass was gone home and sent the shot after him— Webster says the President has directed that the correspondence here after must not be official— Cass sent three copies of this enormous lampoon at once; one to Webster himself, one to the Globe and one to the National Intelligencer; the two last for publication— The life of John C. Calhoun cooled me down, and Madame Calderon’s Life in Mexico refrigerated me— Dr Thomas was here and softened the tedious evening. "

Eighth day of confinement to the house, and of time if not entirely wasted; lost for the purposes to which I had devoted it, and leaving a blank for all useful purposes— I intended to have called this morning at the Department of State; but I wasted so much time in looking up the traces of Jackson’s Negotiations with Mexico for Texas and San Francisco that the hour for visiting the public offices upon business passed away, and I must wait another day.— Anthony Butler’s mission to Mexico was chiefly to obtain the cession of Texas— His Letter to Jackson dated Mexico 15. April 1830. (Omnibus 3. 323) contains the first promise of success— His next Letter of 25 May 1831. (p. 381.) is apologetic and less encouraging.— The next despatch of 16. July 1832. to the then Secretary of State Livingston encloses minutes of two conversations of Butler with the Mexican Secretary of State Alaman, after which a written proposition dated 15 July 1832. was delivered to Alaman, but has never been made public— From that time till 26. February 1835— Butler was mistifying Jackson, as he boasted he was doing with Alaman, promising nothing, but leaving him not without hopes. The Letter of 26. February 1835. (p. 555—) is the crowning mystification; about 2 months after which Butler came to Washington where on the 17th. of June he made his proposals— They also are among the missing papers— There are two subsequent instructions from John Forsyth Secretary of State to Butler of 2 July and 6. Augt. 1835— In the first of which he is told that from his own accounts no confidence is entertained of the success of his negotiation: but that as he is sangwine of succeeding in a very short time he may go and try his luck again—but that he must despatch his whole business with expedition and have the result ready to be laid before Congress by the 1st. of December then next— And that it is expected he will himself immediately after return home. He goes accordingly back to Mexico— Writes two dalling despatches to notify that he cannot finish his business in quite so short a time as he had expected; and on the 15th. of January 1836 (p. 573) receives notice dated 16 December 1835 apprizing him that he has been superseded by the appointment of another person— It was in a despatch of 6. Augt. 1835. That Forsyth instructed him to propose the Rio Bravo to the 37th. parallel of Latitude, and along that parallel to the pacific—the main object being to secure within our limits the whole Bay of San Fransisco.— Butler tells him he has mistaken the Geography, and that the place he means in called Puerto Antonio Nuevo, within which is a Small town called San Francisco—and this is the San Francisco, for which Captain Tyler’s mouth waters— Morning visit from David L. Child, and Matthew St. Clair Clark spent a long evening with me— Joseph H. Adams was here before dinner. Dr Thomas intermitted. "

                "text": "25. V:30— Saturday.  Fahrenheit 20.  At last, after eight whole days of confinement to the house, I made out to reach the Department of State, and had a three hours conversation with the Secretary Daniel Webster There was in the National Intelligencer of this morning an editorial article of 4 1/2 columns written by Webster himself on the Convention of March 1824. between the U.S. and Great Britain for the suppression of the African Slave-trade— It refers to the recent debates in both Houses of the British Parliament and both chambers of the French Legislature upon the right of Search; and especially to a speech of Lord Brougham on the 7th. of last month in the British house of peers contesting statements just before made by Monsieur Dupin in the French Chamber of Deputies concerning this identical Convention— The main object of the Article is to show, that the Senate of 1824 did in the most unequivocal manner concede this right of search— It gives the yeas and nays in the Senate on the question of advice and consent, with the names of A. Jackson and Thomas H. Benton in the affirmative— I asked to see the manuscript copy transmitted by General Cass to the Department of Mr Guizot’s Letter of 25. May 1842 to him, in answer to his protest of 13. February; and he made up a packet of it; with a despatch to Edward Everett prepared, but not yet forwarded, to be read to Lord Aberdeen and a copy of it to be furnished him if he desires it: being the quip modest, to the Letter from Lord Aberdeen, which Mr Fox by his order read to Webster in his Office about a month ago— This despatch to Everett is in Webster’s best style, and makes a direct issue with Lord Aberdeen and Sir Robert Peel on the point that there is by the Laws of Nations no clear, explicit and avowed distinction between the right of visitation, and the right of search. Also a long Letter of Instructions dated 15 March 1843. to Commodore Matthew C. Perry, going out as commander of the eighty gun squadron to be kept on the coast of Africa— To these he added the 11th volume of Wheaton’s Reports containing the adjudged case of the Mariana Flora in 1826— I spoke of Genl Cass’s recent outbreaks against him, but he did not appear inclined to discourse upon that subject— It was clear he remembered the Call of the house of the 13th. of June last year for copies of the Quintuple Treaty with Cass’s Correspondence, and the President’s refusal of them on the 28th. It is curious that Cass’s despatch with Guizot’s answer to the protest, was received on the 22d. of June— I spoke of the Senate Bill for the occupation of the Oregon Territory, of Ap-Catesby Jones’s exploit at Monterey; of the movements in and about Texas, and I suddenly asked him if Waddy Thompson had been instructed to negotiate for the acquisition of California— He faltered and said he did not know whether he could answer that question consistently with his official duty— I told him his declining to answer was answer enough for me, and we had warm and almost, not quite, angry words— I kept my temper, but pressed him more closely upon his declining to answer answer my question, than was comfortable to him— He had begun by professing profound confidence in me—and in communicating his own instruction to Edward Everett, and Upshur’s to Commodore Matthew C. Perry, had said he would open to me Administra Secrets— Why he should now stop short and roll himself up in mystery upon the plea of official duty he did not explain— I saw he was deceiving me, and the danger of trusting him, and that it behooved me above all things to be upon my guard. I said I would not press him to divulge any administration secret that he was inclined to withhold— That he had volunteered the confidence of administration secrets; and I could not see why they should be tendered on one point of the system of foreign affairs and denied on another— I considered all the questions about the right of search—the bill for the occupation of the Oregon territory. Captain Jones’s movement on Calefornia, and all the movements for the annexation of Texas, were parts of one great system looking to a War for conquest and plunder from Mexico, and a War with England—and alliance with France— And I referred to Wise’s Speech of 14. April last avowing this project of a War with Mexico for conquest and plunder together with a War with Great Britain— I said Wise had blabed the whole project last April; and it could not pass without notice that that same Henry A. Wise had in the last hours of the late session of Congress been three times nominated to the Senate as Minister to France. It was also not less remarkable that Wise had been the confidential correspondent of Commodore Jones and had stated on the floor of the house that he had received from Jones himself a Letter in justification of his occupation of Monterey— Webster said I was wrong in all this— That Jones’s movement on Calefornia, was a freak of his own brain without any authority or instruction whatever That Wise’s speech (of which he had no knowledge) was a vain and senseless bravado— That with regard to the annexation of Texas, his decided opinion against the measure had long been public—he had not changed it, and it never could be effected by him, or with his consent.— I replied with warmth, till at last he told me that he had talked over the Oregon question with Lord Ashburton— That England wanted to come down on the Coast of the Pacific, to the mouth of the Columbia river— And that the question had been put to him, whether if a cession from Mexico South of our present boundary 42, to include the Port of San Francisco could be obtained, England would make any objection to it—and Lord Ashburton thought she would not— I thanked Mr Webster, for thus much of communication, and said I would now press the enquiry no further— I propose to visit the Department again next Monday.— But what an abyme of duplicity? We had a very small take leave evening party to Mr and Mrs Roosevelt— Mrs Seaton and her family and two or three others here. "

                "text": "26. V:45— Sunday.  Fahrenheit 25.  At the second Presbyterian church this morning the Revd. R. R. Gurley Secretary of the Colonization Society, preached from Luke 17.20. [“]And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: 21. Neither shall they say, Lo here! or Lo there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.”— The discourse had a slight allusion to a popular panic extensively prevailing at this time and in this Country—raised and propagated by a man named William Miller; who by a profound study of the bible prophesies has patched up a prediction of his own, that the end of the world is at hand— I have received I know not from whom several pamphlets and hand bills on this subject and among them a small duodecimo Volume entitled Evidence from Scripture and History of the second coming of Christ about the year 1843. exhibited in a course of Lectures, by William Miller. The Lectures are 19. in number, and have been repeatedly delivered by Miller in various parts of this Country— On the covering page of the Book is a printed notice that the Vision began 457. years B.C. and ends in 1843.— There is in the book a profuse expenditure of ingenuity of close logic, of biblical criticism, of sacred and profane history; like the Russian palace of ice, built to celebrate a marriage of dwarfs— Mr Gurley did not make much of his text; nor is it very clear what is meant by the kingdom of God, in this passage— It would seem to be the same thing as the days of the Son of man, afterwards repeatedly used in the same chapter— But the close of the 21st. verse—the kingdom of God is within you, seems to have no connection whatever with the second advent of Christ— Mr Gurley gave notice that there would be no service at that church this afternoon; and I collected from his prayer, that the congregation have given a call to Dr. Ezra Stiles Ely, which he has accepted— After dinner at St. John’s church Mr Hawley read the Evening service for the fourth Sunday in Lent, and preached from Isaiah 30.26. [“]Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound” It is not always easy to discern the connection between Mr Hawley’s text and his discourse, nor especially his propensity to select his texts from the Book of Isaiah— This Chapter itself and the text as a part of it is abundantly obscure— It begins with imprecations against the people of Judah who relied upon the aid of the Egyptians, to protect them from being conquered and oppressed by the Assyrians; and finished by a dark prediction of redemption from the Assyrian yoke— And a declaration that Tophet is ordained of old—for the king—deep and large—the pile, fire and much wood—and the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone kindles it— This is generally understood to be the Bible description of Hell; but who can form a distinct conception of what it is.— Certainly not the place nor the condition adverted to in Mr Hawley’s text— My time was much absorbed in recording the double diary of yesterday, much of my conversation with D. Webster being omitted. "

Mr Weems called on me again this morning to request of me a certificate of facts relating to a controversy between him and William A. Weaver, who was the superintendent clerk at the Department of State for printing the census. Weaver, under cover of this appointment to superintend the printing of the census had undertaken a private job to prepare a compendium or abridgment of it for which he had contracted with Blair and Rives that they should pay him 3500 dollars. On the 9th. of June 1841. The House of Representatives at my motion passed a Resolution calling on the President for a return of the aggregates by Counties and Cities— I called at the Department of State, where Weavers work as far as it was finished was shewn to me by Mr Webster’s order, and I said that was what I wanted and I was told it was nearly finished— But no answer to the Resolution was returned by the President, at that Session, nor until the 4th. of January 1842. when a Report from the Secretary of State, with a totally different document was sent to the House— Weems had told me that Weaver was secretly bargaining with Blair and Rives to give the printing of the document unlawfully to Blair and Rives, and wished me to insist with the Secretary of State that the printing should be done by Gales and Seaton the Printers of the house; but not chusing to meddle with that question I declined speaking to Mr Webster about it— Weaver succeeded in his bargain of plunder with Blair and Rives— Thomas Allen the Printer of the Senate screwed out of Webster another bargain for printing the same document—and counter memorials and a select Committee of investigation, and scurrilous counter pamphlets will, terminate by payment of all the printers bills, and the complete fleecing of the public— Weems says that Weaver has falsified the printing of his testimony before the investigating committee and then presented his own falsification as evidence to support a charge against Weems of perjury before the grand jury.— He asked me again for a certificate, which I promised to write, and to have ready for him to-morrow— I called at the Department of State, and returned to Mr Webster his Letter of Instructions to Edward Everett—the Instructions of Secretary Upshur to Commodore Mattew C. Perry, and the Office copy of Mr Guizot’s Letter to General Cass in answer to his Protest— A very short further conversation with Mr Webster— He wishes another Negotiation with Great-Britain— But they keep Mr Fox here; only to make him pensionable— He has a private Letter from Everett, and one from Lord Ashburton— They will take the line of the Columbia river, and let us stretch South at the expence of Mexico— Mr Fox came in and I went into Mr Hunter’s chamber, where he brought several of the Archives of the Departme and among the rest the correspondence of Anthony Butler. His Letter to Forsyth of 17. June 1835 must be read again. "

Tuesday  Mr Connell called on me this morning and requested of me a Letter of introduction to Mr Pageot the Chargé d’Affaires from France— His purpose is to request Mr Pageot to forward for him a Memorial to Louis Philippe the king of the French, setting forth certain services of relief, kindness and humanity which in the year 1813 to numerous French Officers returning from the wreck of Napoleon’s army which invaded Russia.— He had a volume of Niles Register published in 1820. containing a narrative of these transactions and bearing the most authentic and unqualified testimony to Mr Connell’s services at that time, at considerable inconvenience and expence to himself— He said that he had recently met with so many misfortunes in his private concerns that he was reduced to great distress, and had been advised by some of his friends, particularly by Mr John Spear Smith, to address this memorial to the king of France, who upon this state of facts would feel himself under obligations to remunerate those services.— I told him that I would very cheerfully give him a Letter to Mr Pageot; but that I could scarcely say I was acquainted with him— There was no personal intercourse between him and me, and had been none between his predecessor Bacourt and me, since I questioned in a public Lecture, Louis Philippe’s title to the crown— This fact I knew had been reported to the king, and therefore a Letter of recommendation from me would do him harm rather than good— Connell did not seem to be satisfied, but did not insist— My morning wasted away till it was near 2. O’Clock P.M before I reached the Department, and immediately went into Hunter’s chamber. I made an abstract of the Letter from William A. Slacum a purser in the Navy, (since deceased,) to the Secretary of State Forsyth, dated Alexandria 1. August 1835.— This was the Letter which kindled the passion of Andrew Jackson for the 37th. line of Latitude from the river Arkansas to the South Sea—to include the river and Bay of San Francisco—and was the foundation of Forsyth’s instruction to Butler of 6. Augt. 1835. authorizing him to offer 500000 dollars more, than he had received authority to offer before.— There is another long Letter from Slacum, relating to the commerce of the several South American States— Both prove him to have been an observing man— I had not time to begin the abstract of Butler’s Letter to Forsyth of 17 June 1835— The substance of which is a proposal to purchase the cession of Texas by bribing a priest named Ygnacio Hernandez with 500000 dollars, and he encloses a note signed Hernandez assuring him that with 500000 (he says not what) he will certainly obtain his object— There is an endorsement on this Letter signed A. J. forbidding bribery or corruption— Walter Hellen was here this afternoon, and we had as evening visitors Mr King the Painter, Greenough the Sculptor, and John Connell. "

Wednesday  The months of January and March for the present year 1843. changed places in the atmosphere, the first having been so springlike, that the buds on the fruit trees were bursting into blossom, and I remember no month of January at Washington so frost benumbed and snow clad as has been this expiring month of March— This day however it relented, and seems preparing according to its proverbial character to go out like a lamb. My cough is apparently subsiding, but my plan of occupation is broken up, and I am irretrievably spellbound in idleness— The day was fair and the temperature mild; but my vis inertiae so insuperable that it was near one when I got to Mr Hunter’s chamber at the Department of State— I took up again the Volume of Anthony Butler’s despatches to the Department of State and to President Jackson during his mission to Mexico, and began the abstract of his Letter to Forsyth of 17. June 1835.— But I made little progress, my attention being diverted from that Letter to other parts of the correspondence, and to the reading of numerous other Letters— I found that I could not understand the subject thoroughly but by a rigorous chronological examination of all the documents— The appetite for Texas was from the first a Western passion, stimulated by no one more greedily than by Henry Clay.— He had denounced the Florida Treaty for fixing the boundary at the Sabine; and held and preached the doctrine that we should have insisted upon our shadow of a claim to the Rio del Norte— President Monroe actually preferred the line of the Sabine, thinking that the extension of the boundary woaken us for defence— And Jackson expressly approved the line of the Sabine— The first act of the Mexican Government after declaring their Independence was to claim the boundary as settled by the Florida Treaty and we had consented to it. But with the commencement of my administration I appointed Poinsett Minister to Mexico and Mr Clay instructed him to propose the purchase of Texas— This they declined but two years after the proposition was renewed— They then rejected it resentfully.— But Jackson was so sharp set for Texas, that from the first year of his administration, he set his double engines to work of negotiating to buy Texas with one hand and instigating the people of that province to revolt against Mexico with the other Houston was his Agent for the rebellion, and Anthony Butler, a Mississippi Land-jobber in Texas, for the purchase— Butler kept him five years on the tenter hooks of expectation—negotiating, wheedling, promising and finally boasting that he had secured the bargain by bribing a priest with half a million of dollars— Jackson at last found him out and dismissed him rather abruptly. But he carried off some of the most important documents of the negotiation— They exchanged the ratifications of a new convention this day at the Department of State. D. L.

IV:30 Thursday  The change of the Season has been this day completed, by the substitution rather of Summer than of Spring, for the Winter which has ruled supreme over the month of March— My cough has very much subsided but has left in its place a listless languid incapacity of action, which operates upon me as a palsy, and baffles all my good purposes—  I walked this morning to the Capitol, and on my way met Joseph L. Williams, a member of the last Congress from Tennessee, who is yet here. He told me that Henry A. Wise, who has offered himself as a Candidate for re-election to Congress, in a stump speech at Louisa last week qualified Henry Clay as a sot and a liar.  At the capitol I obtained two copies of the Message of the President of 18. Feby last, relating to the seizure by Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones of the Mexican town of Monterey in California; and several other Documents concerning Mexico and Texas of which I had made a list, In the Resolution of the house, calling for the Monterey document, I had called for all the Instructions to Commodore Jones, and all his communications to the Navy Department—purposely omitting the usual exception of such as the President might deem it improper to communicate— I had moved the Resolutions by direction of the Committee of foreign affairs though it is not so stated on the journal of the house— Cushing voted against the Resolutions in Committee and was at his request excused from voting on them in the house because they did not contain the exception. The Message adverting to the omission of the exception, assumes a discretionary power in the executive to with hold any documents called for by Resolution of the house, but says that in this case all are given because he sees no necessity for withholding any.— I believe that at the next Session of Congress, it will be my duty to move some action of Congress on this document, though I have no hope of succeeding in that or in any thing else— Never in my life was there such an array of discouragement before— Never despair!— Returning from the capitol I stop’d at the National Intelligencer Office and obtained from W. W. Seaton the four papers containing the correspondence relating to Cass’s protest against the ratification of the Quintuple Treaty; and the subsequent controversy between Cass and Webster about the Ashburton Treaty— After my return home, a dull headache, and overpowering lassitude disabled me for the rest of the day, till late in the evening when I made out to finish a statement for Jesse E. Weems, about my call for the aggregates of the census returns, and the rascally job, perpetrated between William A. Weaver and Blair and Rives for the printing of the compendium.— I received a Letter from Mr Frye, with a note from the Miller Speakman, informing me that the snow and rainstorm of Tuesday Night carried away the milldam, and that of course the rent from that day ceases— My wife received also a Letter from our Son dated that same Tuesday Evening at Stonington where he had been with his wife since the Evening before, detained by the storm— She was coming here—but from fear of embarking on the Sound, they concluded to return the next morning to Boston.

He had some time last year brought it to my house and exhibited it to me, but I did not understand its mechanism or its operation sufficiently to judge of its usefulness— I declined giving him a certificate upon my general rule— He had one from the Revd. Dr Ezra Stiles Ely.— Mr Child was here this morning; and I gave him a copy of the reprinted Executive Documents N. 40 and 42 of the 1st. Session of the 25th. congress 1837. containing the most important papers of our relations with Mexico and Texas. I desired him to ascertain from Genl Almonte whether the paper delivered by Anthony Butler to Lucas Alaman, on the 15th. of July 1832, and another paper afterwards delivered by Butler to Santa Anna, and never answered by him are not among the Archives of the Mexican Government, and if they are to obtain copies of them— I requested him also to endeavour to procure the St. Louis Newspapers containing Benton’s Essays under the signatures of Americanus and La Salle in 1829. which he promised to do. I called to see Mr T. B. Johnson, who is afflicted with a paralytic disease; the issue of which may occur from hour to hour, and yet may linger along for years— Thence I went to the Department of State, and put into the hands of Mr Webster the last Letter received from Dr Flügel of 25. November last, imploring my aid to obtain an allowance of his charges in an account for expences not authorised by Law, but which he was ill able to bear, and had incurred without knowing that they were not allowable.— I told him that Dr Flügel was an entire Stranger to me, but that Mr Wheaton had recommended him to me, as a very poor but respectable man of Letters— Mr Webster took the papers and said he would see what he could do for the Doctor— He sent me also the London Globe and Times Newspapers received down to the 3d. of this Month— We said something about the North eastern boundary maps, and I mentioned one to him as being in the Department which he had not seen. I then passed into Hunter’s chamber, and made a short further abstract from Anthony Butler’s Letter to John Forsyth of 17. June 1835— Hunter had the first number of a Texan Newspaper Feby last. containing a list of the members of the Executive Government— Also a list of the Masonic Government— A Royal Arch Chapter, of which Anthony Butler is the Grand High Priest. Without finishing my abstract, I came home at 4 O’Clock in the Rain which continued steadily all the afternoon and evening. Joseph H. Adams was here, and also Miss Cutts— This afternoon Mr Richard I. Morsell came and made his annual payment of 300 dollars for the purchase of the house and lot in square 214— In the Evening Isaac Hull and Mary and her daughter read for me in the London Globe of 1. March a curious debate in the house of Commons on the subject of education. "

Edwards a Letter of Enquiry from Jonathan Parker of Plympton relating to the act passed at the late session of Congress granting an additional pension for one year to certain widows of Revolutionary Officers and Soldiers— Mr Edwards gave me several printed copies of the Act, with a form of application by the widow to obtain the benefit of it, and promised to write me an answer to Mr Parker’s enquiries— I then went to Mr Hunter’s chamber at the Department of State, and finished the extracts from Anthony Butler’s Letter to the Secretary of State Forsyth of 17. June 1835— Neither this Letter, nor that of W. A. Slacum of 1. August 1835 was ever communicated to Congress; but in them originated the project of enlarging the encroachment upon Mexico from the mere acquisition of Texas, to embrace all New-Mexico, to the 37th parallel of Latitude, and thence across the continent to the South-Sea— Butler’s Letter connects with it a project for a commercial line of communication between the Arkansas river and the Colorado of California, uniting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans— The Texian expedition of last year to Santa Fe, must have been a sucker from the same root— Ap Catesby Jones’s occupation of Monterey— Dr Linn’s bill for the organization of the Oregon territory: and above all the tampering of Webster with the Mexican Minister here, Almonte, by a proposition that Mexico should cede to the United States the Port of San Francisco, and the parallel 36 of North Latitude across the continent to buy the consent of Great Britain with a cession to her from 49 to the Columbia river present altogether a spectacle and prospect truly appalling.— The root of the danger is in the convulsive impotence of Mexico to maintain her own integrity, geographical, political or moral, and the inflexible perseverance of rapacity of our South and West, under the spur of Slavery, to plunder and dismember her.— Butler’s bribe of half a million of dollars to the confessor of Santa Anna’s sister was too gross even for Jackson’s stomach to allow him to give it his official sanction—but even while ostensibly disapproving it, he sent him back to Mexico with liberty to try it in his own way; and it failed. Hamilton of South Carolina tried it upon Santa Anna himself and failed— Mr Hunter brought me the volume of secret instructions to agents of foreign intercourse, and there I found a despatch of 14. January 1843. to the present Consul at the HavanaCampbell full of the most combustible matter, putrid with Slavery and the Slave trade— It announces the receipt of information from the Havana, and a highly respectable source, charging the English abolitionists and Government with a deliberate project to occupy and ruin the Island of Cuba— And the Consul is instructed to collect and transmit all possible information on the subject— Matter for more enquiry and deep meditation. The instructions promise that we will not permit Great-Britain to occupy the Island of Cuba— Mr J. J. Greenough was here this Evening. "

He supplies the pulpit until the return of Dr Ezra Stiles Ely from Missouri— When he rose in the pulpit I was struck with his resemblance to Robert Barnwell Rhett, the member of Congress from South Carolina.— He read the 16th. chapter of Luke, and commented shortly upon the parable of the unjust Steward, noticing the objections taken to the forms of expression importing that the Lord commended the unjust steward for the perpetration of an atrocious fraud, upon the general principle that the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light— The words commended and wiser must be understood in an ironical sense; and yet it seems incongruous that the Lord, plundered by his faithless steward should commend him for the worldly wisdom of his device to indemnify himself for the loss of his place. Mr M’Carer’s text was from Revelation 22.11. [“]He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still:” omitting the remainder of the verse:—“and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.”— The doctrine inferred from the text was that the retributions of the world to come will be eternal— A brief account of the composition of this book by Saint John in the island of Patmos was given— That is a prophesy of coming events till the end of the world— That this sentence in the closing chapter of the book has direct reference to the final consummation of all things— That it is equivalent to a positive declaration, that the wicked cannot change their nature after death—that they will continue wicked in the next world as they were in this, and their crimes and of course their punishments will endure, for endless ages— This is presbyterian creed, but very defective logic— The premises do not warrant the conclusion— Though it cannot be denied that the context gives countenance to the reasoning— Mr Stephen D. Smith dined with us— Afternoon at St. Johns Church. Mr Hawley read the evening prayers for the fifth Sunday in Lent; and preached from Zechariah 4.10. “For who hath despised the day of small things?” Half a verse— A sentiment applicable to all human affairs; but here specially applied to the rebuilding of the temple of Jerusalem by Zerubbabel— Mr Hawley generalizes, and did not explain why the rebuilding of the Temple should be called the day of small things— The prophet Haggai had announced The glory of the latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord of hosts— Bishop Whittingham was to have come to administer the rite of confirmation to many; but was detained by indisposition— After church I visited Mr T. B. Johnson— "

Morning call from Mr Heman Lincoln— He is connected with the Baptist missions, and has been on an excursion into Virginia— He was inquisitive upon the prospects of the approaching Presidential election— He asked my opinion of the chances and agreed with me that the prospects were in favour of Martin van Buren. He thought the prospects of Henry Clay as irretrievably gone: as I have no doubt they are— Those of Tyler, Calhoun, Cass, are equally desperate— Buchanan is the shadow of a shade, and General Scott is a Daguerrotype likeness of a candidate—all sunshine, through a camera obscura. Mr Lincoln’s partiality was for Theodore Frelinghuysen or judge John M’Lean I had never heard the name of Frelinghuysen as a candidate before; and M’Lean, is but a second edition of John Tyler—vitally democratic, double-dealing and hypocritical— They will all go into the democratic convention, and all melt into the Corinthian brass of Kinderhoek. Mr. Lincoln urged me warmly to publish my Lecture upon Faith. I told him I had promised a copy of it for publication; but I supposed they had forgotten it, to the Trustees of the Warren Street Chapel Boston where it had been first delivered— I gave Mr Lincoln copies of my jubilee of the Constitution—of my speech of 14 and 15. April 1842 on War with Mexico and England—and of my Lecture on the social compact— I went to the Department of State, and saw Fletcher Webster the chief clerk— The Secretary his father left the City last Night for a visit of ten days to Boston— I gave the son a Letter from Plymouth for reference to the Secretary of the Navy, and went into Hunter’s chamber where I spent three hours in examining the instructions to Poinsett and Anthony Butler, and their correspondence relating to the boundary with Mexico and to Texas— The enquiry deepens as I proceed; and I shall as usual be obliged to break it short off for want of time to find its sounding. The Chronology of the Negotiations for the acquisition of Texas and California would of itself be a labour of weeks, and yet without it I cannot master the subject for any useful result— Upon enquiry of Mr Hunter for the Essays of Americanus and La Salle, he brought me a thin volume of Missouri, and other Western Newspapers of the year 1829. forming a complete collection of those documents, none of which had I ever before seen— The first instructions under the Jackson administration on this subject was from Van Buren to Poinsett 25. August 1829—precisely at the time, when Benton was publishing Americanus and La Salle at St. Louis. I have reading for at least a month opened to me by the cursory perusals of this day— I made up the minutes of the Committee of foreign Affairs. "

My cough has much abated, but has not wholly disappeared; nor can I expect that it ever will; but I am now confined almost entirely to the house by the weather—an easterly wind with alternate snow and rain having chilled and darkened the whole of this day— At home I took up the Message and documents relating to the seizure of Monterey by Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones.— There is no warrant for it in any of his written instructions from the Navy Department— But I remark, with no small concern 1. the special charge of exploring the coast within the gulph of California and as high as the Port of San Francisco—one of the reasons of which is the weakness of the local authorities, and their irresponsibility to the distant government of Mexico. 2. The tone of intercourse both military and diplomatic, bearing upon Mexico— It would never have entered into the head of Jones to commit such an outrage upon a Nation whom he believed able to resent it— Waddy Thompson’s diplomacy is in perfect keeping with this temper— Even his apologies are insolent, insulting, and contemptuous; and there is far too much of the same spirit in the notes of our Secretary of State— The spirit of encroachment upon Mexico, is stimulated and nourished by this settled and but too well founded conviction of her helpless weakness in conflict with the gigantic energy of our national avarice and ambition— When I contemplate the prospect before us, my heart sinks within me for the cause of human freedom—and for our own— At the Department of State too I found matter for gloomy anticipations in the instructions of 13 Jany last to the Consul at the Havana Robert B. Campbell which discloses great alarm at the Havana and thence instigated here, at the supposed design of the British Government to take possession of the island of Cuba; and a real design at the Havana to urge us to be before hand with Britain, by taking it ourselves. The Secretary of State tells the Consul in a very trenchant tone that we shall not permit Great-Britain to take possession of Cuba— The real fact I suppose to be that the British Government are turning the screws upon the importation of Slaves into the island and that they can no longer in defiance of all Law, and all Treaty, openly gorge their markets with 25000 bozal negroes every year— The Havana has been and is one of the last inexpugnable haunts of the African Slave trade pirates. I received Letters this day—one from B. R. Curtis, reminding me of my conditional engagement to deliver next August the anniversary discourse to the alumni of Harvard University, and one from James Savage, for the anniversary of 29. May— "

He went to Norfolk, but remained there only a few days— Since he came back he has had a long interview with the President, and has written a tart Letter to the Secretary of the Navy. He has preferred charges against Coll. Henderson, which the Secretary refuses to entertain— Freeman says that Wise advised Upshur to sustain Henderson because he was a Virginian against Freeman who was nothing but a Yankee. The Colonel has obtained an informal permission to be absent for an indefinite time from his station at Norfolk, but no encouragement to expect a resto-rastoration to Boston— He is brooding over a memorial to Congress, against Henderson, and perhaps against the Secretary of the Navy, Upshur. He asked me, if he could depend upon Mr Parmenter to present his memorial. I said any member from Massachusetts could present the memorial if he insisted upon it; but I could not advise the measure, for he would have all the Executive, and all the Virginia influence against him, besides that of Henderson himself and of his family, which was very great— Coll. Freeman seemed to believe that Congress would easily be persuaded to abolish the Office of Colonel of the Marine Corps, which he believed to be altogether useless; but then the Office would devolve upon the Lieutenant Colonel—that is, upon himself— Mr Beck came with a subscription paper, for the purchase of a collection of coins or medals, of sundry kings of England and France, from Dr Wyatt, for the National Institute. I spent again about 3 hours at the Department of State, examining the correspondence of Anthony Butler with the Department concerning his Negotiation for the purchase of Texas— He was himself a speculator in Texian lands.— First despatched with the Instructions of Van Buren to Poinsett of 29. Augt. 1829. His first Letter is from Attakapas 17. Octr. 1829. complaining of having been delayed on the road by sickness— On that same day, Poinsett’s Letter of recall was signed and a long jesuitical Letter of Instructions to himself as Chargé d’Affaires, to which Office he had been appointed on the 12th. of October— There is some mystification in these dates; probably explainable.— Butlers second Letter is from Bexar, near the river Nueces, in TexasNovember 1829. and the third 31. December 1829 from the City of Mexico. Poinsett departed immediately after loaded with execrations, and Guerrero’s government was in the agonies of dissolution— I enquired of Mr Hunter, if any answer had been received from Robert Campbell, the Consul at the Havana to the secret instructions of 14. Jany last and he brought me the answer dated 9. Feby 1843.— He discredits entirely the secret informer’s tale about the intention of the British Government to take possession of the Island of Cuba: but joins in holy horror of the English abolitionists, and is in full confidential communication with General Valdez the present Governor General— R. D. Cutts was here this Evening, but I did not see him— "

But he shewed me a respirator which he had sent for to New-York, an invention of which I had never before heard, but to be used by personals with pulmonary complaints for breathing fresh air, softened by the medium through which it passes— Dr Sewall came in while I was there and Mrs Heman Lincoln who with her husband lodges at the same house— I thence prolonged my walk to the capitol; meeting on my way the members of the late Congress, Sumter, Proffit, and Joseph L. Williams, who says that Proffit is going as Chargé d’Affaires to Sardinia— I went into the Congress Library and for about 5 minutes looked into the first Volume of Hazard’s State papers, for some account of the New England Colonial confederacy of the 16th century, but I had no time for examination.— In the Clerk’s office, I asked of Mr Burche an explanation of an entry on the printed journal of the House, of 22d. February last, p. 437. that the great Latimer petition, and five others when presented by me, under the order of the house of 29. March 1842 “The reception of these petitions was objected to; and the question of reception was laid on the table”— This entry was false— They were all referred to the Committee on the judiciary; of which I furnished to Mr Burche the written proof in my own list of the petitions presented by me, which I had given to him with the petitions, and which he had returned to me— Burche admitted the facts, and after some titubation, said that Kingman had made the entry, and that he had overlooked it by inadvertence in his revisal of the journal—and he promised to have the error corrected which I fear he will not do— I had a search to be renewed for some other Documents— Mr Frye, Mr King the painter, with Miss Eliza Johnson, and Mr and Mrs Horatio Greenough spent the evening with us.

Friday  Spring is at last setting in; the sky is clear, and the atmosphere balmy; but the effect on the bodily frame relaxing into extreme lassitude and imbecility— I awoke about 3 this morning with a fit of severe coughing, and a muddy head-ache which passed off before breakfast, but left me drowsy and torpid throughout the day— Mr Child called on me, and gave me the first sheet of a pamphlet which he is publishing on the Texan Revolution, and the late outrage in California.— I had a long conversation with him on this and other consanguineous subjects, and I advised him to keep his eye steadily fixed on occuring events in the island of Cuba— He told me, that Webster had within a few day renewed his propositions to General Almonte, for a cession by Mexico of six degrees of Latitude along the shores of the pacific, and the parallel of 36 across the continent.strike the Arkansas river. This would include Monterey of California and Santa Fe of New-Mexico— I called upon General Almonte himself and he told me that Mr Webster had renewed the proposal for the cession, the other day, when they exchanged the ratifications of the recent Convention for the payment of the adjudicated claims— There are rumours coming from New Orleans that Santa Anna had released a judge Robinson, one of the Texian prisoners taken in their late predatory expedition, and through him had made overtures towards the recognition of the Independence of Texas— Almonte said he had no doubt that judge Robinson had been released, but he believed not a word of his being charged with any proposal for recognizing the independence of Texas— For he knew that Santa Anna considered the recovery of Texas as vital to the existence of the Mexican Republic, and he had the day before yesterday received Letters from Santa Anna, of very recent date which gave no intimation of any such proposed negotiation; which he thinks there must have been if it had been contemplated— Especially as he himself had been a prisoner in Texas with Santa-Anna, and was perfectly acquainted with all his views concerning that territory— I spoke of the rumours that Great Britain had offered her mediation between Texas and Mexico— He said the British Consul had made an informal tender of such a mediation—but it had been rejected with an expression of surprize that Great Britain should undertake to negotiate for the Independence of Texas, knowing as she did that the revolt of that Province had originated and was to be consummated solely for the reinstitution of Slavery which had been abolished by Mexico.— There is now a rumour that Great Britain has offered Texas, to mediate for her Independence with Mexico, on condition that Texas shall abolish Slavery. Almonte said he knew nothing of that— He promised to call on me before I leave the City— I went to the Department of State and looked again for about an hour into Anthony Butler’s correspondence, but could not command my own attention and came home. Joseph H. Adams dined with us. Afternoon walk. Walter Hellen here— My wife confined to her bed. "

Congress 3d Session, in answer to two Resolutions, offered by me on the 1st. of February under instruction of the Committee of foreign Affairs, though not so noted on the journal of the house— On the 31st. of Jany I moved the Resolutions in Committee— Cushing alone voted against them on the ground that they called for all the instructions to Captain Jones and all his correspondence, without the usual exception of such as the President might deem it improper to communicate— When I moved the Resolutions in the house Granger immediately moved the previous question Wise shuffled it off for that day by calling at the expiration of the morning hour, for the orders of the day.— The next day, the previous question was carried— The yeas and nays were taken upon the resolutions. ay 116. of whom 23 democrats, and only two Virginia whigs, Stuart and Summers. Nay 69. of whom 11. Virginians, Barton and Powell, whigs, of the number— Cushing asked to be and was excused from voting— The Message notices the omission of the usual exception in the Resolutions; asserts the right of the executive to withhold the communication of papers which he deems improper for publication; but says he has in this case communicated all, perceiving no necessity to withhold any— Tyler’s arbitrary Spirit, and his flinching practice, have been signally manifested throughout this whole transaction— The document itself is full of matter for future consideration and commentary— I spent again three hours at the Department of State, hurrying over Anthony Butler’s correspondence, especially on the negociations for Texas—with regard to which there are three classes of papers—Public despatches and private Letters to the Secretary of State, and private Letters to President Jackson— There is no record of the President’s Letters to him— It was one of Jackson’s practices to hold private and secret correspondences upon the most important public affairs, without leaving any copies of his own Letters or instructions in the Departments. A most irregular, mischievous and imminently dangerous exercise of power, for which the Constitution provides no remedy.— One of its effects is that there is no trace of Anthony Butler, till his appointment in August 1829 as bearer of despatches to Poinsett instructing him to open without delay a negotiation for the purchase of as much of the province of Texas as could be obtained— How he came to be at Washington in August 1829. does not appear, but the Negotiation was evidently instigated by him, and I have no doubt that he was deeply involved in Texian land jobbing.— On returning home I found the card of Mr George Brown. Walk before and after dinner— Richard D. Cutts and his Sister here— Cry of fire close by. "

[“]For the Lord God is a sun and shield: The Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.” The Sermon began with the usual clerical rather than critical sweeping assertion of the immense superiority for sublimity of the Psalms over every merely human composition— A matter about which after a rigorous comparison with the Odes of Pindar and of Horace, especially the carmen saeculare, I have some doubts— The preacher said further that this 84th. psalm was very beautiful, as it is in the asiatic or oriental Stile— That it was believed to be from the pen of David written at the time of his expulsion from Jerusalem by the revolt of his unnatural, and rebellious son Absalom— Of which I perceive no evidence external or internal— The Psalmist pours out his Soul in extasies of desire to enjoy the privilege of devotion in the tabernacles of the Lord of Hosts— There is no allusion direct or indirect to the rebellion of Absalom; nor to a calamitous condition as the source of inspiration— There was then some comment upon the aptitude of illustration in the imagery representing God, as at once a Sun and a shield— A Sun—the idolatry of Nature— The Sun—of all the visible creation, the object of the greatest beneficence to man.— The source of light and heat—all splendour to the eye— The Parent of all production for nourishment and subsistence believed by the antient Parsees and the modern Parsees to be God himself or the abode of the deity— Then a shield. In those antient day the emblem of protection from all danger, because an effectual guard against every weapon of assault whether of sword, falchion, arrow, javelin or spear, before the invention of firearms— Then the comforting promise of the gifts of grace and glory; and the delightful assurance that he will withhold no good thing, from them that walk uprightly.— The good hearted presbyterian seemed for the moment to have forgotten the atonement by the blood of the lamb— Joseph H. Adams dined with us— After dinner at St. John’s church Mr Hawley read the evening service for the sixth Sunday in Lent and preached from 1. Peter 4.17.—what shall the end be, of them that obey not the gospel of God? He gave notice that during the coming Passion week, there would be service every morning at the Church, and on Thursday Bishop Whittingham would confer the rite of confirmation at 1/2 past 4 p.m.— On Good Friday—service morning and afternoon— After Church, I called and saw Mr T. B. Johnson— And then visited by request Mrs Tudor and Mrs Stuart— "

Monday  The purpose of Mrs Tudor, and her daughter Mrs Stewart in sending for me was to request me, to write to Washington Irving, Minister of the United States at Madrid, in behalf of Frederic Tudor, the inventor of the commerce in ice— He has had for 30 years a special privilege to supply the City of the Havana with that article; but at the last renewal of his patent, a man by the name of Damon, who for many years his agent in the business and grown rich in the agency, took out the patent in his own name, and grasped at the whole profits of the trade for himself— This has involved Tudor in a Lawsuit— Tudor has recovered three sentence in his favour in the tribunals of the Island; but Damon has appealed to the Supreme Court at Madrid— This Court they say cannot reverse the decisions of the Colonial Courts, but may delay their execution, and in the meantime Mr Tudor’s privilege is suspended— Mrs Stewart gave me a Letter to her from her brother Henry Tudor at the Havana, dated 20. March last, urging her to write to General Rodil, minister of War at Madrid, with whom she is acquainted; soliciting his influence as a friend at Court; and she and her mother requested me to enclose the Letter for Rodil, to Mr Irving, with a recommendation of the case to Irving himself, and to forward the Letters with the despatches from the department of State, by the Steam packet, to sail on the 16th. from New-York— This morning I groped again three hours into the despatches of Anthony Butler at the Department of State— The three-fold and double dealing line of negotiation 1. for a commercial Treaty 2. indemnity for all sorts of claims and 3. to strip Mexico of Texas, Santa Fe, and California, and annex them all to this union, runs into the most curious details of Jackson and Tyler duplicity. Butler’s Letter of 17. June 1835 to Forsyth, suppressed in the communication of 4 July 1838 to the House of Representatives is the Passe par tout of the whole system pursued with inflexible perseverance down to this hour— I met at the Department, Mr George Brown, who is going out as Commissioner to the Sandwich Islands— As I was returning home from the Department, I met Dr Mayo, who asked me for a copy of my address of 17 September 1842 at Braintree which I gave him— I received at 4. p.m. a note of invitation from Dr Sewall to attend the wedding of his niece at his house this day at 1/2 past 3— Sent of course an excuse— At 1/2 past 7 this evening I attended a stated meeting of the National Institute at the Patent Office building— Peter Force, a Vice President was in the Chair. I presented the allegorical napkin, and specimens of Saxon Silks from Dr. Flügel Consul of the United States at Leipzig, for which a vote of thanks was adopted— Among the other proceedings was the offer of a Resolution by the revd. Mr Bulfinch for the appointment of a Committee to enquire and report how the meetings of the Institute may be made more interesting and instructive; which after some discussion he withdrew— Home at 1/2 past 10.

Tuesday  Lieutenant Hunter of the Navy, called on me this morning and asked me to examine his new invented war steamer Union now at the Navy-yard, and of which he has a small model at his lodgings at Fuller’s hotel— I promised to call there and see it at 11. O’Clock to-morrow morning— He gave me Senate document 244. of the 3d of March last, the last day of the last Session—being a Report made by him to the Naval Committees of the two houses, after examination by them of his Steamer on the 26th. of February— The report was presented to the Senate by Mr Bayard the chairman of their naval committee. The invention of Lieutenant Hunter, is of a submerged horizontal propeller of the boat, substituted, for the paddlewheels of Fultons invention;—but with paddlewheels under the water. I walked to and from the capitol; and met in the Clerk’s Office Edward Stanly who since the close of the Session has been home and has come back— In the document chamber, Mr Elmore, heretofore a member of Congress from South-Carolina, and in the Capitol-yard Horace Everett, who told me that he expected to remain here about a fortnight longer— I was desirous of completing a file of Documents concerning our relations with Mexico and Texas: and had made out a list from the Index to the House Documents from 1831 to 1839— I obtained a considerable number of them; but of several of the most important there are no spare copies left— Returning home, I stop’d to visit Mr Burnell, who is yet confined to his chamber, though convalescent— The assortment of my pamphlets to have them bound up in volumes, not only absorbs an enormous quantity of time, but consumes the labour of the mind, which should be devoted to productive thought, and terminates in distraction—day after day passes off and the time is gone— To concentrate my reflections upon one of the numerous projects floating in my brain I began yesterday an address to my late constituents of the 12th late, and my future constituents of the present 8th. congressional districts of Massachusetts, which if I have the courage and perseverance to finish it, I may deliver as a Lecture before the commencement of the next Session of Congress. I know not how this may succeed—the time is not propitious for me to speak to my countrymen unpalatable truths—but I wish to leave behind me something which may keep alive the flame of liberty and preserve it in that conflict between Slavery and freedom which is drawing to its crisis and which is to brighten or to darken the condition of the human race upon earth— I wrote this Evening a short Letter to Washington Irving at Madrid, and received one from Mrs Stewart, to General Rodil; and requesting that her mother might see my Letter to Mr Irving before I send it— "

Wednesday  The work upon which I have at length undertaken to concentrate the employment of my leisure time and the result of my meditations, in the form of an address to my constituents past and future deepens in interest as I proceed; and widens in the list of topics which I propose to discuss— Already I perceive that one discourse of two hours duration will not suffice to unburden my heart of the sentiments and opinions which I believe vital to the happiness, peace and future liberty of this great people— Whether any thing that I can do or say, will avail to save and preserve them from the dangers with which they are beset; or to avert the Catastrophe impending over them, an all wise Providence will decide— The prospect of the future is deeply discouraging; but despondency would surrender the cause; and exertion even if fruitless will be sanctified by the motive for using it— I called at 11. this morning at Fuller’s hotel, and examined the model Steamer of Lieutt. Hunter’s invention, in which the paddlewheels are under water on the two sides and close to the bottom of the boat—with a horizontal instead of a perpendicular rotation, an unincumbered deck, and noiseless machinery— I agreed to go with him to-morrow morning at 11. if fair, and visit the Union Steamer itself at the Navy-yard. Thence I went and smothered three hours more at the Department of State in rapid survey of Anthony Butler’s correspondence— This man was in the last War with Great Britain Lieutenant Coll. and then Coll. of the 28th. Regiment of infantry; appointed as a citizen of Kentucky— He says in one of his Letters that he is a native of South-Carolina; and that he was many years an intimate and confidential friend of Jackson under whom he served in the New-Orleans campaign.— His appointment in 1829 as bearer of despatches to Poinsett, and afterwards as chargé d’Affaires to Mexico, was as a Citizen of Mississippi, and he was at that very time a jobber in Texian Lands— His looseness of moral principle, and political profligacy as disclosed in several of his Letters— His vanity and self sufficiency in others— He boasts of his address in managing Lucas Alaman, by mystifing a little, and while under the shield of diplomatic privilege, brutally insulted the Mexican Minister of War, General Tornel, by scurrilous and insolent Letters challenging him to fight a duel— Tornel’s conduct in return was rather tame than spirited— Santa Anna demanded Butler’s recall; but Jackson had already dismissed him— Mr Hunter shewed me also a despatch from Joseph Eve, Chargé d’Affaires in Texas, telling strange and incredible stories of suspicions and distrust among the Texians of their President Houston. Stanly and Childs were here when I was out. "

Rainy day— At my request my nephew Hull Adams went to Lieutenant Hunter and proposed to postpone to a fair day my visit with him to his Steamer Union at the Navy Yard—to which he readily assented— I received this morning from Jeremiah Hughes of Baltimore, the present publisher of Niles National Register the missing numbers of the 62 and 63 volumes which I had written to him to obtain— I took them to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and left them there to be bound— I saw Mr Gales there somewhat perplexed by the publication of Mr Webster’s letter to Edward Everett, recently despatched and which he is instructed to read to Lord Aberdeen, and give him a copy of it, if desired— Gales asked me if it was usual in negotiation to publish in the newspapers controversial notes, before they have been received by the parties to whom they are addressed— I told him it was not usual heretofore; but that of late years all negotiation is little more than a perpetual appeal to public opinion, and the negotiators little more than advocates before the tribunal of the civilized world— I referred him to the case of the Spanish Minister Pizarro who in 1818 addressed to George W. Erving Minister of the U.S. in Spain a manifesto against General Jackson’s invasion of Florida, equivalent to a declaration of War, and before waiting for our reception of it; published it in a Hamburg Gazette whence it was circulated all over Europe. In return for which my answer of Instructions to Erving, was communicated to Congress, and published all over the Union, before it could reach the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the Counterpart to his manifesto— Other instances of more recent occurrence were referred to in the case of Gorostiza’s pamphlet published here in 1836. of General Cass’s publication of his preposterous protest against the ratification by France of the Quintuple Treaty, and the triangular debates between the British Parliament the French Legislative chambers, and the North American Congress like a game of Chess played by correspondence between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, or between Nova Zembla and New-Zealand— I visited Edward Stanly, Timothy Childs, and John C. Clark at Mrs Owner’s on the Capitol hill— Met them at their own door, just returned from a visit with Lieutenant Hunter to his Steamer Union, with which they are much pleased— Clark has just buried his lovely daughter Josephine, in her 15th year, a school companion of our Mary-Louisa— Stanly starts for home to-morrow morning—still uncertain whether he will be nominated for re-election to the 28th. Congress or not. Childs is still detained here by sickness but looks convalescent— At the document room of the house I obtained two copies of the Message of 14 July 1842. containing part of the peppery correspondence between Webster and Bocanegra "

Another day of solitude; rain and gloom with the exception of a three hours visit to the Department of State— There, the progress of my enquiries into the biography of Anthony Butler, and of Andrew Jackson’s projected dismemberment of Mexico, is disturbed and protracted by the daily occurrence of new incidents which consume the time and divert my attention from the main object of my pursuit— I found at the Office this day four different weekly newspapers in the month of March down to the 29th.— 1. The Civilian and Galveston City Gazette, published at Galveston. 2 The Telegraph and Texas Register, at Houston— 3. The Texian and Brazos farmer, at Washington; and 4. The western Advocate, at the City of Austin—a new paper of which I had before seen the first number.— These papers are of opposite political parties are highly excited partizans for and against their President Samuel Houston; all passionately devoted to the lone star of Texas; all of the Catonian school, exterminating War upon Mexico; and all panting for annexation to the United States— T. W. Gilmer’s Letter is in one of them with a warm commendation of its object and argument; an earnest exhortation to the Texians to gather up their forces for a renewed application to our Congress at their next long Session, with assurance of kind support from our amiable President, and an easy disposal of the opposition of Johny Q— Dr Robinson was at Galveston, with the compromise propositions of Santa Anna which will be rejected with disdain—and Rusk, the appointed Major General, was breathing blood and slaughter for the invasion of Mexico, if he could but get hold of the Law for his own appointment— Mr Hunter furnished me a new Map of Texas—Austin’s, published by Tanner in 1840. and shewed me another despatch from Joseph Eve, dated at Galveston 29. March— In the midst of all her vices, difficulties and troubles, Texas is swelling with incredible rapidity into a formidable Slave State which Mexico can never recover, and from the contamination of whose Slavery nothing can save this Union, short of a special interposition of Providence— Mr Hunter produced to me also this day a private note dated 25 July 1835. signed A. J. and directed to the then Secretary of State Forsyth—proposing additional Instructions to Butler to offer half a million more, for the line of the Rio del Norte from its mouth to the 37th. degree of Latitude and thence straight to the pacific— This note was the seminal principle of the Instruction from Forsyth to Butler of 6. August 1835—published in Doct. 42. p. 18. of Message 3. Octr. 1837.— In the regular examination of Butler’s despatches I have only reached his Letter of 25. May 1831. refering to and answering one from him of 24 March 1831. which is not at the Department. I continue to write morning and evening on the proposed address to my constituents, but begin to shrink from the task. "

She is here! and brings to me uninterrupted leisure, instead of which this daily record, my brooding address to my Constituents, and my researches at the Department of State, fill to the brim every vacant hour, and keep me on the rack of overplied occupation as laborious as at the busiest period of the Session of Congress— Meanwhile my correspondence runs into irredeemable arrears and my private affairs and impending duties are neglected— One thing at a time was the maxim of John de Witt— Too many irons in the fire at once is the fatal flaw in my economy of time. It was past one O’Clock this afternoon when I reached my table in Mr Hunter’s chamber at the Department of State— He was not there— In pursuing the correspondence of Anthony Butler I find a Letter from him to President Jackson of 25. May 1831. extracts only from which were communicated to H.R.U.S. in document 351. p 382—where a line of stars represent two most important pages of the despatch— Jackson, in a Letter to him of 24. March 1831 had complained of not hearing from him later than the preceding November— This despatch is a long and laboured apology for delay in the Texian Negotiation, but he proves 1. that this delay had been expressly enjoined by Van Buren’s instructions to him, as well as by his own convictions of expediency, and 2. he proves the shortness of Jackson’s memory in pretending that he had received nothing from him of later date than November, by referring to a publication in the Washington Telegraph of a paper transmitted by Butler to him with a despatch dated in January— This is one of the numberless instances of Jackson’s reckless disregard to truth, when the impatience of his temper betrays the frailty of his memory— Jackson’s passion for the acquisition of Texas was intense. Butler was a Texian land-jobber, who treated Jackson, as he boasts of having treated Alaman, the Mexican Secretary of State and negotiator with him— “Mystified a little so as to leave him not without hope.” Alaman and Butler played a game of tame cheating in which each intended to overreach the other— Butler mystified with Alaman and Alaman mystified with Butler.— Alaman was the shrewdest knave of the two— When Butler wrote this despatch he had just discovered that Alaman had made him his dupe; and he with ludicrous gravity discloses his first doubts of Mexican sincerity He advises Jackson to insult Montoya who coming out to supersede Tornel as the Mexican charge d’Affaires, and give him to understand that Mexico was of very little account with us— Edward Livingston took the place of Martin Van Buren as Secretary of State on the 27th. of May 1831. and his correspondence with Butler began with a sharp altercation about some irregularity in Butler’s accounts. The Galveston civilian of 29. March the comment on Robinson’s mission, and on T. W. Gilmer’s Letter are to be remembered— Short walks before and after dinner. Walter Hellen was here this morning, and Miss Cutts took tea and spent the Evening here— Isaac Hull dined abroad "

[“]There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.” The discourse began with a dissertation upon the disposition natural to all mankind to seek for peace or happiness, in which he prosified Pope’s invocation— O! happiness our beings end and aim—or Horace’s Otium divos rogat impotente, Prensus AEgeo.— This is a hacknied commonplace. He then adduced as instances of the torture of remorse suffered by the wicked in the cases of Cain—of Saul—and of Judas Iscariot— He then described the distress and uneasiness always experienced by vicious persons specifying only the Miser and the sensualist— This list might have been much enlarged, and sharply pointed to exhibit the real wicked intended by the text— The preacher finally addressed his very scanty auditory and enquired whether among them there were not some who felt themselves included within this denunciation—exhorting them with great earnestness to work out their own salvation, by the consciousness of their own depravity, and of their own inability to save themselves— The main difficulty for this text is to affix a precise idea to the word wicked. In the general doctrine of human depravity, I concur, I hope in humility and sincerity, with fervent prayer for divine aid in self chastisement and correction— But I was not much disturbed by this malediction upon the wicked, by the fear that it includes me— I confess my unworthiness, and labour to redeem myself from it—relying only upon the mercy of my maker— The house was nearly empty, and from the urgency of his prayer that God would provide a pastor after his own heart for this people, I inferred that the Reverend Dr Ely has finally declined their invitation to him to come to them I attended the afternoon service at St. John’s Church, where the Revd Mr Oliver Abbot Shaw, of Philadelphia, read prayers for the evening of Easter day and preached from John 11.25. “Jesus said unto her ‘I am the resurrection and the life.[’]” The preacher observed that this day being devoted to the celebration of Christs own resurrection, this saying of his on the occasion of his raising Lazarus from the dead seemed appropriate to the devotion of the day; and remarked upon the peculiar energy of the words, being at the third demonstration given of his power to raise the dead—the first being in the case of Jairus’s daughter and the second in that of the widow’s Son at Nain. And here he claimed to be the resurrection itself because as Adam in his fall had represented the whole human race, so Christ in his own resurrection equally reprented that of all mankind. "

The address to my constituents, and my investigations daily at the Department of State, into our public relations with Mexico and Texas, all have one object, the contribution of my last public labours to the cause of human freedom, in its present and impending conflict with Slavery. The field is too vast for me: An address of two hours which I am proposing to prepare will scarcely skim the surface of the subject; and the dangers of the undertaking are more appalling than its toils— But I must pass on— Sursum corda! The preacher whom I heard at Saint John’s church yesterday afternoon, Mr Shaw, called on me this morning, and had with me a conversation of more than two hours. He is a native of Lexington, Massachusetts, and is now a settled minister of the episcopal church at Philadelphia and a professor at the high school in that city— His grandfather was an inhabitant of Lexington, when the revolutionary War commenced with the bloody conflict of that spot and shared in it. He was also at the battle of Bunker’s hill, and an ardent patriot of the Revolution, and lived and died a country farmer at Lexington.— He had always a strong and bitter prejudice against England and every thing English, and once in riding down to Cambridge with his grandson when a boy, and pointing out to him the university buildings as they passed along, the boy seeing the episcopal church on the other side of the square enquired what that was, and he answered that is the tory meeting house— Mr Shaw told me other anecdotes of his own life, and made numerous enquiries relating to mine which I readily answered— He said it was so dark yesterday afternoon that he could not see to read a written sermon which he had in his pocket, and was obliged to extemporize which he did— He enquired much as to my practice of extempore speaking, which I acknowledged was wretchedly imperfect, but which yet was such as anxious labour and unwearied pains have been able to make it— I considered it as an art for the gift of which the seeds of which are given by nature to be cultivated by intense study and matured by frequent practice and long experience.— My own original portion of the seed being next to nothing, my cultivation of it inadequate— My experience much interrupted and my practice like every thing about me unsystematic, confused and drowsy.— At the department of State my progress with Anthony Butler is provokingly slow.— Hunter shewed me a Letter from the Sandwich Island Commissioners Halilio and Richards to D. Webster, of 3. March 1843. who say Lord Aberdeen declined to acknowledge the Independence of the Islands, because we had not acknowledged it, and were endeavouring to obtain exclusive privileges for ourselves— Also a Letter from St. Louis Missouri, claiming to be recognized as Consul from Texas at that place. Joseph H. Adams who has just received his Commission of Lieutenant came and took leave, going home on a furlough for 3 weeks; and then ordered to the coast of Africa. David L. Child spent the evening here. "

Tuesday  Dull weather and chilly atmosphere— Dr. Sewall called upon me, and informed me that he proposed to leave the city next Monday to embark in the Steamer at Boston for Liverpool for the purpose of visiting the medical schools in England, Scotland and Ireland— Then those of the continent of Europe, Holland, France, Germany, including Hamburg, Berlin, Vienna, and Italy, and to return home by next October— He repeated a request he had heretofore made that I would furnish him with a Letter, and I promised him one to Edward Everett— In the course of my address I find occasion every now and then to state a fact, for the authentication of which I must have recourse to a document; and that puts me upon a chase which always consumes hours, and often leaves me disappointed, having found every thing that I did not, want, and failed to find precisely what I did. At the department of State this day I was disconcerted in the examination of Anthony Butlers negotiations from the condition of his correspondence— The negotiation for the commercial treaty was open and ostensible Poinsett had on the 12th. of January 1828. concluded with the then Mexican Government two separate Treaties one of Commerce and one of limits— From the time of the Mexican Declaration of Independence, she had assumed the boundary agreed upon by us with Spain in the Florida Treaty, as the existing boundary between her and us, to which we had assented in 1824. Poinsett, under Instructions from H. Clay, approved by me had proposed and urged the purchase of Texas for one million of dollars, which Mexico had rejected and refused to conclude a Treaty of Commerce unless with another, confirming the Florida Treaty line boundary.— The two Treaties were to be ratified, and their ratifications exchanged within four months from their date, but they were not. When Jackson came in, after some time the Negotiations were renewed to revise the commercial Treaty, but Jackson proposed anew the purchase of Texas for which he authorised the offer of 5. millions of dollars, while at the same time Sam Houston went into Texas to kindle an internal insurrection and separate Texas from Mexico— Poinsett Was recalled and Butler was charged with the double negotiation— Poinsett’s Treaty of limits was reconcluded, and his commercial Treaty revised and altered— The two new Treaties were signed by Butler, and on the part of Mexico by Alaman and Manjino on the 5th. of April 1831. They were to be ratified and the ratifications exchanged within one year from the date and on the 5th. of April 1832. Jackson issued his proclamation declaring that the ratifications of both Treaties had been exchanged. (more to morrow). David L. Child here—this Eve. "

He is a speaking example of the chemical affinities between power, patronage, place and political opinions— He came here two years ago, a flaming Harrison whig, devoted soul and body to Daniel Webster, and shaping all his opinions to the pattern held up before him by Webster. He was then also a great admirer of me, and expected perhaps some aid to obtain a place which might be suitable for him— He commenced reporter and Letter-writer for sundry Northern whig Newspapers, and has adhered faithfully to Webster through all the events; vicissitudes of men and things—and disappointments of the late years— He clings faithfully too to Caleb Cushing, and insists that if he would offer himself as a Candidate for election in the third district he would be elected by a large majority.— Mr Samuel Crepps of Fayette County Pennsylvania came and had some conversation with me— I received a Letter from Seth M. Gates explaining the address to the People of the free States against the annexation of Texas— Mr Seaton sent me also a manuscript sent to him for publication in the Intelligencer by Mr Horace Everett, but without signature, on the controversy concerning the right of search— Mr Everett requested it might be perused by me before publication, and in the piece itself there is a call rather earnest upon me, without naming me to give to the public my opinions on the subject. I called at the Intelligencer Office, and returned to Mr Seaton, Everett’s manuscript, and gave him also the Liberty Press extra sent to me by Mr Gates, and requested him to publish in the Intelligencer, the joint address to the people of the free States against the annexation of Texas; which he promised— I could not reach the Department of State this day— It was on the 15th. of July 1832 that Butler delivered to Alaman the paper of proposals for the purchase of Texas, of which he never transmitted any copy to his own Government— Within a week after Alaman was removed from Office, and a revolution took place in the Government of Mexico—on the 25th. of July 1832 Butler addressed a note to Monasterio, chief Clerk in the Mexican Department of foreign Affairs, announcing that President Jackson had proclaimed the Treaty of limits as the law of the Land and was ready to appoint a Commissioner on the part of the U.S. to run jointly the boundary line with a Mexican Commissioner but that he thought a revisal and new line of boundary was very desirable.

Croghan called on me this morning to borrow 250 dollars of his want of which I had no reason to doubt; but which I had not the means to supply; subsisting as I do with my family on the annual payment for my dwelling house sold to Morsell part of my real Estate, which I cannot reinvest but must consume in my current household expenses— I declined therefore with suitable civility. Going to the Department of State, I met Mr Caleb Cushing, who has returned here, after a short visit to his late constituents— Before he went he gave out that he would offer himself as a candidate for re-election—but after he got home his heart failed him, and he requested his friends not to put him in nomination— But he still considers himself a public man, and though thrice rejected by the Senate on the nomination for Secretary of the Treasury; he evidently still relies upon the fixed fact as the open Sesame, to the precious vaults. He told me, he expected to remain here about ten days.— Mr Webster returned from his short visit to Marshfield last evening. At the Department, Mr Hunter gave me to read a late despatch from Mr Picket Chargé d’Affaires at Lima in Peru, written in September last, communicating the fact of Captain Jones’s departure from Lima, and of his intention to take San Francisco if Mexico and U.S should prove to be at War or if it should burn out as was rumoured that Mexico had ceded California to Great-Britain. All which Mr Picket approves— Another Letter from Allen A. Hall, written last December at Caraccas mentions the arrival there of a Mexican Commissioner bound to Lima in Peru where a Congress of South Americans were convening, said to be to form a league of defence against the grasping designs of the United States upon Mexico— Hall is Chargé d’Affaires of the United States to the Republic of Venezuela—and thinks this league against our usurpations very ridiculous— He says it is not at all approved in Venezuela and they certainly will not seen a Commissioner to the Assembly. Lieutenant Hunter came and said he was ordered with his Steamer Union to Norfolk and must go on Saturday. He invited me to visit her at 4 O’Clock this afternoon, which I did, with Isaac Hull— We rode down to the Arsenal. Lieutenant Hunter came in the Steamer’s barge, and took us to her, in the channel at the mouth of the Eastern Branch. We spent about an hour on board and inspected her organization, arrangements and machinery. Lieutenant Hunter then landed us in the same boat and we got home before Sunset. "

I received this morning, under cover from my son at Boston, to whom it was addressed for me a Letter from Edward Everett, in London, answering mine to him of 13. March on the 40th. day from that on which it was written— My Letter was acceptable to him—but whether available is left for after consideration— He sends me a printed copy of his answer to Mr Schofield and the American Bond-holders— Mrs Wirt, with her daughter Mrs Randall and her infant boy were here this morning— Mr and Mrs Campbell dined and spent the Evening with us— Mrs Campbell was Mary daughter of Charles Harrod of New-Orleans— Campbell was here and left the city on theof January last—since which he has been to New Orleans—married her, and brought her back thus far.— Our evening visitors came from various social impulses— Mr Hawley to explain and reconcile me to a total evisceration of the pews and reorganization of them to raise money for paying off the debt of the church, excellently well calculated to aggravate it— At the Department of State, I crept along with the pace of snail in the examination of Anthony Butler’s correspondence— In 1833 Santa Anna broke up the federal Constitution, and with the aid of his bayonets was elected President. Mr Butler is consulted by persons whom he does not name to know if the Government or capitalists in the United States will make a loan to Mexico, he says not for how much— He advises to turn it into a bargain for the sale of Texas, or a loan upon mortgage which they will certainly never redeem.— He addresses this in a private Letter to Jackson, who instrucks Livingston to reject at once the loan, and to write forthwith to Butler, to bring his negotiation to a close; for that on the 1st. of April the American Colonists in Coahuila; are to hold a convention and declare their Independence,—after which he says it will be useless to treat with Mexico for Texas— Livingston instructs Butler accordingly, but Butler hangs on— This precise knowledge of Jackson to a day of the intended design of the Colonists to declare their independence as early as April 1833. was suppressed in the document communicated to the House in 1833— I walked before dinner. left my watch chain at Keyworth’s to be repaired; and examined at Taylor’s a new invented inkstand—a humbug.

Barnard of Albany was here yesterday with his father in Law, Mr Stevenson; but I was out and did not see them— They have been since the close of the Session of Congress to Savannah in Georgia and Mr Barnard is quite delighted with his tour.— My address to my constituents absorbs three fourths of my time—and I have reached three fourths of a two hours address, and have yet scarcely entered upon my subject. I should have laid out for an address of three hours, and even then my stream would have overflow’d its banks— It spreads and widens before me, though I am constantly labouring to dam it in— It is much the same with Anthony Butler’s Negotiation for Texas— For six long years he was mistifying Jackson with the positive assurance that he was within a hairs breadth of the object and sure of success, while Jackson was all the time wriggling along and snapping at the bait like a mackrel after a red rag, and there is not one line to show that Butler ever made to any one in Mexico the specific proposal that he was instructed to make, at first; or the enormous stride upon it, authorised by Forsyth’s Letter of 6. August 1835— The most impressive conclusion that I draw from the comparison between the manuscript and the printed documents is the unscrupulous suppression, upon a call from the house for all the correspondence at a crisis when the President had actually asked of Congress authority to wage war, of every scrap of paper, which it did not suit to make public— It proves how utterly inefficient, the reservation of the power of declaring War, to Congress is, as a check upon the will of the President to wage it—is— My progress in examining Butler’s correspondence at the Department of State is so slow that I shall be obliged to break it up without getting half through— The Steamer Britannia which brought Edward Everett’s answer to my letter of 13 March, brought also the reports of a long and searching debate in the British Parliament upon the Ashburton Treaty—terminated after a pitched battle between Lord Palmerston and Sir Robert Peel, by the failure of a Quorum in the house That historical blunderhead Jared Sparks had made serious mischief by one of his spurious discoveries, of latent correspondence and a map countenancing the British claim of boundary; but the production of Mr Jay’s map at New-York and simultaneously of Mr Oswald’s map at London have prostrated that vile imposture— I walked out towards evening to seek Mr D. L. Childs’s lodgings, and was overtaken by a shower— Met Mr M. Poor at his door in 6th. Street: He lent me his umbrella, which sheltered me from the rain while returning home— Mr and Mrs Campbell dined with us. "

                "text": "23. V.30. Sunday.  At the second Presbyterian Church Mr M’Carer preached, taking for his text the whole first Psalm—[“]1. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful: 2. But his delight is in the Law of the Lord; and in his laws, doth he meditate day and night. 3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season: his leaf also shall not wither: and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 4. The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away 5. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 6. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.”— The preacher first observed the peculiar appropriateness of this Psalm as introductory to the whole collection— That it was commencing with a contrasted portraiture of the characters and destination of the righteous man and the Sinner. He said there were various opinions with regard to the author of this Psalm.— It might perhaps have been David; but it was more generally believed by the learned in biblical Literature to be the production of Ezra, the Priest, who formed the collection of the canonical books after the return from the Babylonian captivity— The style of the Book of Ezra, and that of this Psalm have it would seem to me no congeniality to indicate the same hand.— The Psalm is sublime poetry. The narrative of Ezra is rather beneath the elevation of historic prose.—but Mr M’Carer said that by whomsoever composed it was dictated by divine inspiration— The beauties of the imagery, the tree by the riverside, and the chaff driven before the wind form beautiful pictures of the Oriental pencil— And the Sermon closed with a warm exhortation to the auditory so to order their ways as to be like the trees by the side of the rivers— Mr and Mrs Campbell dined and spent the Evening with us— And while we were at dinner a very heavy thunder gust came over us, an incident which reminded us, that according to the Miller prophesies this was the day for the final conflagration of the world— At St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read the Evening service for the first Sunday after Easter and preached from John 3.17. “For God sent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”— Cutts’s and Walter Hellen here— "

Dr Heap entered the service in 1804. as a surgeon in the Navy, continued in that station till after the close of the last War with Great-Britain when he was appointed Consul at Tunis; where he remained till the change of administration brought in General Harrison— Captain Tyler seems to have determined, from the moment of his accession to cast off the Heap, and without consulting him he was displaced from his consulate, which was given to W. B. Hodgson, and Heap as if in mockery was appointed Dragoman of Commodore Porter at Constantinople— When he reached Constantinople he found that Porter was a wreck to whom no dragoman could be of any use, and besides had a dragoman of his own—his nephew—and Heap was soon after displaced there too. He came home and is now with a large family; without employment and without subsistence. He left a quire of papers with me to read, and promised to call again to-morrow— Mr Whipple from St. John, New Brunswick, is the gentleman who was so obliging and attentive to us, when in September 1840 we were there— He comes now to solicit the appointment of Consul of the United States in that City, and wished a commendation from me to Mr. Webster— I called at the Department of State and saw him, and told him the answer that I had received from Edward Everett to my Letter of 13. March— I spoke of the recent debates in Parliament on the Ashburton Treaty, terminating in the house of Commons, by the Speaker’s adjourning the house for lack of a Quorum— I spoke of the lucky discovery of Mr Oswald’s map together with that of Mr Jay at New-York, and of their blowing up Jared Sparks’s impostures in mousing among the papers of that old juggler Vergennes.— Mr Webster lent me some Morning Chronicle containing reports of the debate in the Commons—and a despatch and a confidential Letter from Edward Everett about the maps, the debate and that gibbet-bird United States Geologist Featherstonhaugh. I spoke to Mr Webster about Whipple, but he said they had had his application before them these six months and last week had appointed a Mr Anderson of Maine, recommended by Mr Evans Consul at St. John. I spoke of Heap, but he said John Howard Payne had been appointed Consul at Tunis and he thought there was no occasion for any consul at Tunis; and that the Office ought to be abolished— I said I hoped the case of Mr Heap would be considered separately from that of the usefulness of the Consulate— I called to see Mr Burnell, still confined to his chamber.— Genl. Almonte was here when I was out—and Fendall in the Evening. "

Dr Heap was here again this morning; very anxious about the prospect of his obtaining some appointment for subsistence in his old age— He has been shabbily treated—removed from his quiet sinecure at Tunis, to make way for W. B. Hodgson, and appointed Dragoman at Constantinople—that is translator from and to the Turkish Language, of which he never unstood one single word; still he went to Constantinople with his family, and at Malta on his way learnt that he was superseded, and a young man a nephew of Commodore was appointed in his place.— He came home leaving his family at Constantinople, and now must go again to fetch them thence. I told him I had spoken of him and recommended his case to Mr Webster, though I knew not with what success— He said Mr Webster had received him with coldness and Mr Tyler with much more and upon his representing the unceremonious manner in which he had been displaced from his office at Tunis, Mr Tyler in a tone of fretful uneasiness had said I cannot remove my friend—Payne—meaning John Howard Payne, the histrionic parasite, who was here all the summer of 1841. currying favour by writing niminy piminy, meretricious letters of courtly adulation of John Tyler to be published in the New-York Herald.— This was the sycophant and this the service for which my friend Mr Payne was appointed Consul at Tunis instead of an old public servant of forty years with a large family to linger about the world for a beggarly subsistence— After drudging all the morning upon the sickening task of my proposed address, I staggered to the Department of State and enquired of Mr Derrick for several notes of remonstance of the former French Minister Pontois. He gave me to read three of his Letters to the Secretary of State in 1837.38.39. and of Forsyth’s answers to them— With the last of which there was a list of all the Laws in the Slave-holding States, proscriptive of free coloured mariners— I asked Mr Derrick for a copy of this List which he promised to have made out and to give me to-morrow— Returned to the chronology of Anthony Butler’s negotiation for Texas—my progress exceedingly slow.— I took no morning walk, but sallied out just before the Evening twilight Walk with extreme pain, and feet excessively sore— Richard D. Cutts was here a few minutes, and David L. Child till near One O’Clock of the Morning— He is publishing a pamphlet on Mexico— "

Wednesday  The pressure upon my brain to conclude the address to my Constituents, before I depart to return home continues with increasing gravity; and the day is now at hand when I must depart from the performance of a different and yet more arduous task. I have concluded to go home next Tuesday, and wrote accordingly to Mr Richard Rush who has insisted on a visit from me at Sydenham on my way home— I wrote also to my son, enclosing a Letter from Ellis Gray Loring about stock in the United States Hotel company, and notifying him that he may expect me at Boston next Wednesday or Thursday. Dr Heap called on me again this morning anxiously hoping for some cheering news from me. I could give him nothing but some cold vague indefinite promise to remember him from Mr Webster— He was specially desirous of being re instated in his office of Surgeon in the Navy, and solicitous for my opinion whether he might hope to obtain it— The chance is a caprice of Captain Tyler, who I suspect has a grudge against Heap for having been too much delighted with the Bey’s abolition of Slavery Mr Heap said he must go in two or three days to embark for Constantinople to fetch his family home— At the Department of State, Mr Derrick gave me the list of unconstitutional State Laws against free coloured Seamen— I copied Jackson’s endorsement upon Anthony Butlers project of purchasing Texas, with a bribe of half a million of dollars to the Confessor of Santa-Anna’s sister— Jackson seems to have seen that this might be a bait thrown out by Santa Anna himself to get into his hands to impute offers of corruption by Jackson— There is colour for this suspicion from the fact that Hamilton the Texian diplomatist did secretly as he thought make the same identical offer of half a million, to Santa-Anna himself who immediately published the Letter and divulged the fact— I find also in Butlers correspondence also that the Mexican Minister Tornel after his return home from his mission here published a pamphlet in which he stated expressly that on his landing at New-York, the Agent of Coll. Thomas Benton came twice to him with numberless other speculators, to treat with him for Texian Lands.— In my walk this afternoon I stop’d to see Mr Burnell who thinks himself convalescent, but I fear is not.

Barbour heretofore a member of Congress from Virginia to a young man named Francis Hume, now a barkeeper at Gadsby’s hotel, but who has some claim to a large Estate in England, by a supposed collateral consanguinity with David Hume the historian, and descent from an Earl of Marchmont, in which Letter Mr Barbour advises the young man to consult me, and take my advice, and he requested leave to send Mr Hume to me this morning, to which I very cheerfully agreed— He came accordingly and asked my advice, but knew absolutely nothing about the nature or justice of his own claim— He said that a Mr Jeremiah Morton a lawyer of Virginia had been to England in pursuit of this claim in 1825, and had had made of it a suit in chancery, and that was all he knew about it, and he understood there were two difficulties in the way—one, evidence to establish the genealogy; and the other the Statute of Limitations— I asked him through whom the claim of consanguinity with David Hume, and through him with the earl of Marchmont was averred— He did not know— I asked him if he had a copy of the proceedings in the Court of Chancery, when left there by Mr Morton— He had not, but he presumed Mr. Morton had— I advised him to procure the copy of those proceedings, and upon seeing them I might perhaps be enabled to advise him further— I overreached the space I had allotted to myself for the address to my Constituents, which absorbed the leisure of the morning— I then rode with Mrs John Adams and Mary Cutts to the Capitol after stopping at Keyworth’s and taking my repaired watchchain— At the Office of the Clerk of the House, I enquired for many documents but found only the Message of 28. Feby last enclosing the correspondence of the Spanish Minister Argaiz, with the Secretary of State Webster, relating to the case of the Schooner Amistad— It was referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs, but the papers were referred to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, sent immediately to the Printers and the Committee never saw them— The correspondence is a fire-brand, over which Tyler casts a bucket of cold water by recommending to congress to refund the salvage claimed by Lieutt Gedney: but Gedney’s claim supposes that the Schooner was Spanish property when taken by him— It was the property of the Mendi captors and ought to have been restored to them— When will the whole truth be told concerning this case?— If I dare to tell it—I shall be arrested before I have proceeded 3 steps on the way—perhaps charged with treason—perhaps expelled from the house— Mr Child was here this Evening.

Of all this there is a lamentable deficiency in my address.— If I had time, perseverance and energy to write four such; and then methodize and abridge the four into one, it might be of some use. But I have neither time—nor strength—nor health—nor Spirits—nor manhood—to go through that process— I must now turn my thoughts and my remnant of my life to other objects— I am engaged to deliver a discourse to the historical Society of Massachusetts, on the 29th. of next month, on the New England confederation of the 17th. century—half bound to address the Society of Alumni of Harvard University, the last week in August next—and invited by a Letter received yesterday from Peter S. Du Ponceau, Thomas Sergeant, William B. Reed, W. Duck and A Langdon Elwyn, a Committee of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, to deliver a Historical Discourse before that institution at any time during the present year that may be agreeable to me— In the decay of body and mind growing upon me with inexorable speed I lack Resolution to say No! to all these propositions, and to retire from the world of business to that of repose— Mr Frye was here this morning and I had much conversation with him with respect to his management of my concerns of property in this City. I ought and intended to have settled them up to the present time since the close of this last Session of Congress—but it has been neglected— I requested of him however; and he promised me a statement of his accounts shewing his receipts and expenses on my account— He explained to me also the project for reorganizing Saint John’s Church, which led me to the determination to relinquish my pew in it. I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer and saw Mr Gales of whom I enquired concerning the address to the People of the Free States signed by me, and 12 other members of the late house, which I gave some time since to Mr Seaton to publish, as he promised— Gales said he did not know that Seaton had promised to publish it— I said if they did not publish it I wished the paper might be returned to me— Mr Childs was twice here. Going to morrow, under a threat of prosecution from Greenhow. Miss Cutts took tea, and spent the evening here. "

I walked out this morning to the meeting of the Pennsylvania and Louisiana avenues, and sat to Mr West for two Daguerrotype likenesses; one of which he took for David L. Child, and one for himself— I did not see either of them, nor do I feel any curiosity to see them— They are resemblances too close to the reality and yet too shadowy to be agreeable— I had once before been painted by Mr Charles in the same chamber— Childs left the City this morning— Not without danger of being Lynched I hear for his pamphlet on the Texan Revolution— The pamphlet smacks of abolition— I received at the Bank of Washington the Quarter’s interest of 1. April—on 3500 on Washington Corporation 6 per Cents 52.50 and 48.75. The 1. Jany interest on 3250 of the Stock, which I left for the payment of household expenses— For the quarter due 1. Jany. I was obliged to get an order from the Register’s Office at the City Hall— I came home overpowered by the Summer heat, and rested for the remainder of the day.— Mr T. B. Johnson has been very unwell for the last three or four days. My wife was with him great part of the day yesterday, and with Mary this afternoon and evening— Mary Louisa’s Music Master was here to give a lesson in singing, and I had a visit from Mr M’Carer the minister who at present supplies the pulpit of the second presbyterian church— He reminded me that Mr John Campbell had introduced him to me about two years ago in the house of which I have no recollection— He said he had resided some years in South-Carolina— He thought it very doubtful whether Dr. Ely would accept the invitation of this church to settle with them as their Pastor, though I have no doubt he took no small pains to obtain the invitation— The Doctor is an able theologian; but has the reputation well earned of being a worldly minded man Mr M’Carer professe to be and I have no doubt is liberal in principle; and he lamented the divisions between the old and new schools of the Presbyterian church— I began my preparation for departure with the attempt to assort and endorse my files of Letters—at all times a heavy labour, but more and more aggravated every time I pass between this city and my home.— The work is always imperfectly done, and in assorting the files I find many Letters which ought long since to have been answered, which ought to be answered now, but which for want of time I could not answer when received, cannot answer now, and never shall find time to answer.

[“]Come and let us return unto the Lord; for he hath torn and he will heal us: he hath smitten and he will bind us up.”— Upon this text the preacher gave a summary account of the Assyrian captivity which he considered as it is represented in the Scriptures, as a judgment of Heaven upon the sins of the People— And this is the remarkable characteristic of all the scriptural history of the old Testament— The creation of one pair of human beings from whom all mankind are descended is the foundation of the doctrine of human rights— The forfeiture of Paradise for disobedience to the will of God is a second moral principle teeming with a multitude of principles.— The Destruction of the whole human race by a flood with the exception of one family still exhibits the same feature— The vocation of Abraham—the assignment of the land of Canaan to his descendants, and all their adventures in it from the crossing of the Jordan by Joshua to the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities, all the prosperous events are attributed to the favour of Jehovah propitiated by repentance for their sins, and obedience to his will, and all their calamities and disasters as punishment for their transgressions and breaches of their covenants with him— The Sin the most severely reproved, and yet that to which they were most addicted was idolatry— Jehovah is declared in the dialogue to be a jealous God visiting the iniquities the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation; and the most aggravated reproaches are cast upon those who bow the knee to Baal, or pass their children through the fire to Moloch— This exhortation of Hosea to the Israelites was addressed to them in the time of the Assyrian captivity, and the tenor of the whole book is to call on the people to return to the God of their allegiance, with a promise of his favour in reward for their repentance. Mr M’Carer made the applica of instructions to his hearers with some allusion as it seemed to me with his yesterday’s conversation with me. He deplored the calamitous condition of the Church, but admonished his auditory that it is as owing to their own sins before God, and that if they would return to him he would return to them— After dinner Mr Hawley read evening prayers for the second Sunday after Easter, and preached but I could not gather from what text— After church I visited Mr Thomas B. Johnson, had half an hour’s conversation with him and took leave of him. Evening busy in preparing for departure— "

Monday  The last day before departure  Always busy, agitating, anxious, and as years advance every time it happens more confusing than the last— As I am this time to travel alone I concluded to take with me but one trunk and an umbrella— Hesitating about the last article, so often needed for shelter from rain or sun; but so liable to be lost, stolen or broken by the way, that about twice out of three times mine is missing at my journey’s end— This days occupation with aid of my wife and nephew was packing up my chest of books and pamphlets and my files of Letters for the last two years to be shipped by the first coaster to Boston, and my strong trunk to be taken with me— Mr Heap called on me this morning, and I returned him his papers, but partly read: He told me he was going by the Cars to-morrow morning, without prospect of any further public employment, and equally unwilling to seek and hopeless to obtain further personal access to President Tyler or Secretary Webster— I received a note from Mr Page the Daguerrotype artist requesting me to call again this day as he was not satisfied with the shades taken on Saturday— I did call accordingly twice, and he took my similitude twice but neither time with much success. At one time he and Mr West took two impressions of me at one sitting, upon two camera obscura’s standing side by side, and shewing the face as by two different angles of refraction. I stop’d at Keyworth’s and took my old silver sleeve buttons relinked after fifteen years of wear— I paid my last visit to Mr Burnell with whom I found as usual his faithful wife and Nurse— They think him convalescent and I hope he is so— While I was there Mr George Brown came in; going to-morrow to Norfolk, Virginia to embark in the Vandalia Sloop of War to be landed at Chagres thence to traverse by land the Isthmus to Panama, and thence to proceed in some vessel of our Pacific Squadron to the seat of his mission to the Hawaÿan Islands. I walked on to the Capitol and there received from Mr Burche, the last sheet of the House journal of the recent Session, and from young Cutts two or three other Documents; but neither the Senate Journal of the last Session; nor the collective house documents of the preceding Session the 2d. of the 27th. Congress were ready for distribution— After dinner Mr Hawley Rector of St. John’s Church called to take leave of me, and enquired if I should incline to rent a pew in the renovated Church having concluded to relinquish that which I now hold. I said I should. Mr Frye came, and gave me a statement of his accounts with me, and Mr Morsell made me an offer of 100 dollars for the lot adjoining the house I sold to him— In both these cases, I procrastinated settlement most neglectfully— Richard D. Cutts and his Sister came and took leave— Up till midnight. "

I think it was over 6. years since I had seen him, and his skin hung about him like an old lady’s loose gown— I asked him if he had been sick—he said no—he was drying up— He had within the last four years, dried off sixty pounds of flesh and I have no doubt he weighs that much less than he did the last time I made a passage in his boat— I scarcely ever saw such a change; and his face looks like a wet cloth ill laid up. In the steamer I saw for a moment the Secretary of the U.S. Senate Asbury Dickens, but he was about to return to Washington; Mr Russell of the interior of the State of New-York; a member of two or three Congresses including the 26th. now returning home from Washington, where he told me he saw yesterday Mr Webster at the Department of State—and he told him he intended to retire from the Department within ten days. Mr Sanderson the first publisher of the biography of the signers of the declaration of Independence; a work of which the first expense was very heavy upon him, and which he was upwards of 5 years in getting through, but of which he afterwards sold the property and the plates, and of which more than twenty Editions have now been published, and the plates have been four times renewed. The last edition is in one octavo volume— Sanderson, said he now kept a public house, in Chesnut Street Philadelphia—the Franklin house, where he would be glad to see me— There was also in the boat Captain Payne of the Navy and his Sister—and a Mr Fessenden, who said he lived at Jamaica Plains, and was now a constituent of mine— We reached French-town at half past 1. then came in the railway cars in 50 minutes to Newcastle, and thence in the Steamer Robert Morris to Philadelphia—at half past 4. I took chamber N. 16. at Jones’s Union Hotel Chesnut Street— In a quarter of an hour more in Mr Richard Rush’s carriage, with his Son Benjamin, I came out to Sydenham, his residence, dined with him and a party of his friends, and agreed at his kind and hospitable invitation to pass the Night here— I retired soon after 11.

                "text": "6. V. Saturday.  I have accepted an invitation from the Massachusetts historical Society, to deliver on the 29th of this month a discourse before them, on the second centennial anniversary of the confederation of the New-England Colonies, and I have come here without and before my family, for the purpose of preparing it— I have paid so little attention to that portion of our history that I scarcely knew the sources at which the principal facts relating to it were to be found—nor have I any clue to the aspect in which it should be viewed for any useful purpose at the present time— Pope makes it a point of self-glorification, that not in fancy’s maze he wander’d long, but stoop’d to truth and moraliz’d his song— I believe that moral principle should be the alpha and omega, of all human composition—poetry or prose scientific or literary written or spoken—and emphatically of every discourse An Epic Poem, a Drama, Pastoral, Georgic or Fable, Ode, Sonnet or epigram should alike spring from one vital seminal principle of morals and so should every History Dissertation, Treatise, Discourse or epistle— Pen should never be put to paper, but for the discharge of some duty to God or man— How then shall I best discharge the duty which I have undertaken of discoursing to my co-associates of the historical Society, and to my fellow Citizens on the New-England Confederation of 1643? What was that confederation—its uses, its origin, its history, its termination—its influence upon the colonies, between whom it was formed; upon their relations with the Indians, with the other English Colonies, with England the mother Country, with the neighbouring Colonies of other Countries; and with the rest of mankind?—and from the result of all these enquiries what sound and useful moral principle can be deduced for the entertainment and instruction of a listening auditory, and of readers here after.— I called at the chambers of the Historical Society. The outer door was locked, with a notice that the Librarian might be found at N 15. Warren street— It was the residence of Mr Joseph B. Felt, whom I found at home where I also saw his wife. He accompanied me to the chambers of the historical Society, and found for me Mather’s Magnalia; the 2d. Volume of Hazard’s collection of State Papers, and three folio volumes of manuscripts which he supposed might assist me in my enquiries. He lent me the keys of the chambers, and promised to call and see me there on Monday. I paid a visit to Mrs Abbott Lawrence: her husband was not at home— I dined with Charles at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s. Walk after dinner. Met Degrand— Evening at home with Charles. "

                "text": "7. IV.15. Sunday.  Thunder and Lightening— Rain  Dr Frothingham preached this morning, from 1. Corinthians 1.18—The whole verse reads “For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness: but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God”— But the text was only “The preaching of the cross, is the power of God,” and the sermon was a most ingenious and deeply pathetic declamation upon the power of the cross, as a symbol of the sufferings of Christ, and of the doctrines of Christianity— The use of this symbol, has been of the sharpest points of controvery between the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches.— It has been heretofore a source of much internal dissension in the episcopal church of England, and is even now revived with ominous agitation both in England and here— It extends even beyond the bounds of the episcopal church, and I was somewhat surprised at the vivacity and zeal with which Dr Frothingham seems to have entered into it— Certain it is that the writings of St. Paul, from which the Dr cited several most impressive passages, countenance a reverence for the cross, which endangers the indulgence of idolatry, as all substitution of attachment to the symbol for the love of the object represented, is prone to do— Of these trappings of Roman Catholic worship the Church of England has discarded many and retained more than enough— She has retained the sign of the cross only in the administration of the rite of baptism, where it is made by the finger of the priest over the forehead of the infant, leaving no trace of it behind— But there is at this very moment a bitter struggle in the episcopal church of England to return to the emblematic worship of popery— There was a passage at the close of the Doctor’s discourse, which alluded without censure to the Roman Catholic worship of the virgin mother of Christ, which belongs to the same School of the adoration of the cross— After the morning service, Dr Frothingham administered the communion with admirable and affecting solemnity— I came home through a shower of heavy thunder and sharp Lightening with a mere sprinkling of rain— After dinner Dr Frothinghams text was from the words “whose seed was in itself” from Genesis 1.11. The discourse as usual; ingenious, fanciful, and copious of analogies with a touch of gentle interrogation, as to the value or efficiency of religious missions to distant foreign lands— After church I had a visit from Mr Abbott Lawrence, who invited me to dine with him on Tuesday. Miss Harriet Welsh took tea here— And with Charles and his wife I spent the Evening at Mr P. C. Brooks’s. "

On awaking this morning I found my sore throat, hoarseness and catarrh returned upon me in all its severity, and in sitting down to write my hand shaking so that it was with extreme difficulty that I could hold my pen; yet my only labour under the sun is writing, as I have little time to spare in preparation for the 29th. I devoted all the early morning to Hazard’s collection of the records of the United Colonies of New-England— They extend from the 19th. of May 1643 to the 24th of March 1678—35 years—including the Colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut and New-Haven. Rhode Island applied for admission to the confederacy but was refused. During its continuance New-Haven was merged into the Colony of Connecticut; after which the Confederate Colonies were but 3.— From the beginning there were only two Commissioners for each Colony; at first annually chosen, for yearly meetings; but of later time meeting only once in three years— The records occupy three fourths of a large quarto volume; but as I have to consult many other sources of information, I skimmed over the whole surface of this compilation, and could of course pry deep into nothing— Yet the morning was gone, and I had yesterday’s journal yet to write; which I nevertheless did accomplish— I then sallied forth and at N. 220. Washington Street found my old shaver of last fall, by the name of Cadmus, after passing through whose hands, I went to the Emancipator Office, and had a long conversation with Mr Leavitt— He is to embark next Tuesday in the Steamer for Liverpool, to attend as a delegate from the American, Anti-Slavery Society the second triennial meeting of the World’s convention, for the promotion of the abolition of Slavery and the Slave trade throughout the Earth— I urged him very earnestly to observe with unremitting care the movements of the British Government with regard to Mexico and Texas— I told him I distrusted them altogether— I believed their real policy far from desiring to favour the abolition of Slavery either in our Southern States, or in Texas. I suspect on the contrary, that for a suitable equivalent they will readily acquiesce both in the annexation of Texas to this Union, and to the perpetuation of Slavery here to weaken and to rule us.— Mr P. C. Brooks and his Son, dined with us at my Sons house, and I began at a perfect hazard to write my discourse. "

Tuesday  The Catarhh has become feverish, and cruelly torturing— I was twice up in the Night before the time for rising came; and this whole day I have been upon the rack— I find it difficult to sustain my Spirits and have concluded to go out to Quincy next Monday— As my first and most indispensable object is to be prepared for the discourse of the 29th. I find it necessary to begin the day with writing upon it— I wrote accordingly and wasted the morning until Noontide without coming to any point upon which I can dilate, to fill up the time necessary for the delivery The confederacy of the New-England Colonies was a system of concert between the several jurisdictions, for the common defence against the French colonial establishments at the North—the Dutch at the South but especially, and above all against the Indians— Shortly before noon, I went locked myself up in the chambers of the historical Society, and searched for notices of Indian wars and the New England confederacy— I soon found abundance of materials for enquiry, and spent nearly three hours in search, rather for the sources of information than in the examination of what I found— I had no time for that— It was some time before I detected the history of the War with Philip—Sachem of Mount Hope— It forms the 7th. book of Mather’s Magnalia— This work deserves great consideration as a sample of the literary, political, moral and religious condition of the New-England colonies at that time— It is a collection of biographical anecdotes; a nauseous panegyric upon all the principal founders civil and ecclesiastical of the New England colonial settlements. With a history of Harvard College, and a narrative of Indian wars, down to the close of the 17th century— The Style is pedantic; motley coloured with perpetual allusions to the bible, and to the Hebrew, Greek, Latin and English Poets— Among the rest, I was surprised to meet a quotation from the Paradise Lost— I found also numerous articles relating to the Pequot, Mohegan, and Narragansett tribes of Indians—upon all which my discourse should have been preceded by a regular and systematic six months course of reading, for which I have less than three weeks— After 2 I came home and went and dined with Mr Abbott Lawrence. Besides his family, there were his Sister Mrs Green, Miss Leslie the painter’s Sister, and Mr Thacher of Bangor— I came home immediately after dinner, and found Mr Kinnicutt and Mr John T. Bigelow with my Son. Mr Felt came in afterwards, and I agreed to go with him at 11. to-morrow morning to the State-house. "

Foster’s and saw Mrs Foster and her three daughters Elizabeth, Louisa and Mary— Mr Foster was not at home, and Louisa C. Smith was gone to Medford.— Mr Felt had agreed to meet me at 11. O’Clock this morning at the Secretary’s Office in the State house— But I had misunderstood him that he would call at my Son’s house for me, and would go with me.— After waiting for him till near noon I went to the State house to the room which he formerly occupied, when employed in collecting in volumes, and indexing the records of the general Courts, and the archives of the State. But this office has been suppressed since the first of March.— He was not there and I came home. He was at the same time in the Secretary’s Office where I neglected to call and enquire for him— He was informed that I had been to the other office after him and he then came to Charles’s and accompanied me to the Secretary’s Office— I examined the volume of Records containing the proceedings of the Commissioners of the United Colonies of New-England— Mr Felt made two extracts for me; but I found little, other than what is printed in Hazard’s collections, and the manuscript writing of that age is so difficult for me to read that I shall obtain little or no assistance from these original records— One of the extracts is a vote of the general Court of 8. Septr. 1642. appointing a numerous Committee of Magistrates and deputies, to treat with any Commissioners from Plymouth, Connecticut or New-Haven [“]about the Union and concerning avoiding any danger of the Indians—and to have power to do herein what they shall find needful for common safety and peace, so as they enter not into an offensive War without order of this Court.”— So that the primary object of the Union was the common defence against the Indians— I was able to write only a few lines of my address this day; and at one O’Clock with my Son and his wife with their son John we took up Mr P. C. Brooks at his Office, and went out and dined with Mr Gorham Brooks and his wife at Medford— This day was pleasant, but with an easterly wind, and its cold bath temperature, peculiar to this region at this Season of the year— After dinner we walked round Mr P. C. Brooks’s garden, just beginning to give signs of vegetable life— The desolation of winter still heavy upon it— About Sunset we returned to the City and received notes of invitation from Mrs. Abbott Lawrence, for this Evening— We had engagements already at M Samuel D. Parker’s my Son’s next door neighbour; but I was so unwell that an excuse was sent into Mr Parker’s, and I wait for to morrow to apologize to Mrs Lawrence. "

I returned also the visits of Mr James Savage, and Mr Robert C. Winthrop, neither of whom was at home— The Revd Mr Lunt of Quincy called to see me and spoke of the very sudden decease in the course of the late winter of his aged Colleague Peter Whitney— I passed the day as with a mill-stone about my neck, working invita Minerva upon my address for the historical Society, unable even to get through with my daily task of two pages, and seeing as yet no point of departure for the discourse. hitherto I stumble one after another upon preliminary points of doubtful propriety to the occasion and more doubtful adaptation to the taste and prejudices of the day.— I find continual occasion to resort to books which I have not at hand— In discussing a confederacy of New England Colonies the subject leads to remarks upon the propriety of the name upon the special sympathies with the condition and characteristic properties of the mother Country old England and to a comparative notice of the elementary composition of the other colonies which now constitute jointly with us the North American Union. This has already brought me upon debatable ground, and upon the accursed domain of Slavery. What shall I do with it? I am upon the breakers, and know not how to draw off from them— The relations of the Colonies with the Indians also constitute another shoal which I have not yet reached but upon which I shall be in imminent danger of stranding.— I can scarcely express how in my weakened condition these thoughts weigh me down.

Brooks and my Son, at Dr Frothingham’s but my cough was this morning so troublesome that I thought it more prudent to decline dining in company, and was excused— Mr Quincy President of Harvard University, and his eldest daughter called to visit us, and the day was assiduously, but very unsatisfactorily occupied in search reading and writing upon my task— I am still on the preliminaries of my subject—still struggling for some heart of argument, not already fagged into common-place— My first spring of thought has been to discriminate between the Colonies of New-England, and the others which constitute our present confederate Government— In commenting upon this I meet the necessity of knowing, exactly the primitive titles of the several New-England Colonies— Mr Felt has lent me a volume published at Hartford in 1836. by R. R. Hinman Secretary of the State of Connecticut, consisting of Letters from the kings and Queens of England, to the Governors of the Colony of Connecticut, with their answers from 1635. to 1749— Much of this day was consumed in turning over the leaves of this book, to trace the origin of the colony of Connecticut, which is yet left to be accomplished— I found it also necessary to examine the first Volume of Hazard’s State Papers, but had not time to look into it— After labouring till close upon one O’Clock in this alternation of reading and writing, I went to Mr Felts N. 15. Warren Street, and borrowed the keys of the historical Society’s chambers. I found Mr Felt’s dinner smoking on the table, though he had not sitten down to it. I had scarcely reached the Society’s chambers when I was obliged to return home to dinner. Charles dined at Dr Frothingham’s— After dinner I wrote the journal of yesterday— Then read the remainder of Lord Brougham’s great Speech in the British house of peers, on his motion that the thanks of this house be given to Lord Ashburton for his treaty concluded last August with Mr Webster— It must be very imperfectly reported— The National Intelligencer of last Tuesday, announces that on the preceding day Mr Daniel Webster resigned the office of Secretary of State, and that the charge of the Department ad interim was taken by the attorney General Legare— And that on the same day Caleb Cushing was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to China, in the place of Edward Everett who has declined the appointment. The reason of Mr Webster’s resignation is not explained— Dr and Mrs Frothingham spent part of the evening here. "

Saturday—  There is no abatement of my Catarrhal cough, although there is some of the symptoms of other diseases with which it is complicated— I slept last night till the crepuscular dawn, which is now about half past 3 in the morning, and then awoke under a load which the racking cough of half an hour could only lighten but not cast off— It continued through the day without sign of mollification. I wrote with heavy heart and drooping spirits the journal yesterday—and then a Letter to my wife, which I could not even enliven with fancies to please her, as a man ought always to do in writing to his wife— Dr Bigelow paid me a second visit and I gave him the diagnostics of my present condition— His advice is still, ale and good living. I had a long visit from Mr Joshua Leavitt— Long conversation with him. He is to embark next Tuesday in the Steamer Britannia, to attend the second triennial world’s convention to promote the abolition of Slavery throughout the world to be held next month in London— I urged him to make close observations, so far as he should have opportunity, to ascertain the real policy of the British Government on this subject; entertaining as I do strong doubts of a compromise between their commercial and their moral policy, much too obsequious to the cause of Slavery for real fidelity to the cause of justice and of man— I desired him to say to Arnold Buffum, and to Joseph Sturge from me, that I intended to have written to each of them by him; but am prevented by my indisposition— And I intreated him as long as he should be there to keep his eye fixed upon Texas, Mexico, California, and especially on the Island of Cuba. He intimated to me that he intended as appropriate to his character he intended to bring before the Convention for consideration certain primary principles asserting the personal rights of men as always transcending the corporate right of Sovereignty— As I was going out I met at the door Commodore and Mrs Downes coming to visit my Son and daughter— Downes told me he did not know I was in the City. After shaving I went to the chambers of the historical Society where I found neither Church’s history of Philip’s War, nor Adair’s history of the Indians which I wanted, but I did find an original edition of John Smith’s history—and a collection of Old Colony Documents recently published by Dr Alexander Young. I had but a short hour at the Rooms, and on coming home, found Lieutt. Joseph H. Adams who dined with us— Under orders for Norfolk and is to go on Monday— Visits also from Mr and Mrs Edward Brooks— He, just returned from Brattleborough Vermont, where he went to see his sick brother Horatio.

Rather a heavy aggravation. Heard Dr Frothingham this morning. From 1. Timothy 2.4. “Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth”— The universality of the Christian faith was the subject but the sense in which the words should be used was to be understood To be saved in this passage, meant evidently to be converted to Christianity, and thereby come to the knowledge of the truth— But what was meant by all? very few— All included neither the inhabitants of Africa nor of Asia, the greater or the less, nor of a great portion of the rest of the earth nor even Palestine where Christ himself was born— But all in this text referred to the various classes and conditions of men, and its object was to shew how the blessings and promises of the gospel were adapted to every age, to either sex, to every class of human kind, and in that consisted the universality of christianity whereby the knowledge of the truth is obtained— The doctrine deduced from the discourse was the obligation upon all to devote themselves to the purposes which the gospel is destined to report. There was a notice read by Dr Frothingham of a meeting to be held by the Society next Thursday for considering a plan to alter and repair the Church— Immediately after the service, I called with Mrs Charles on Mrs Edward Brooks, whom we saw with her Son and daughter— The house belongs to Edward Everett, and is that in which he lived while he was Governor of the Commonwealth. When he went to Europe, it was occupied by Sidney Brooks who with his wife has a passion for elegant furniture, and when they also embarked last November for England, they left all their splendid furniture in the house which Edward Brooks took with more costly articles of his own, and now they all constitute the joint display of the lower rooms. They are monuments of the vanity of riches— They look like a cabinet makers shop in a Sculptor’s studion, and a painter’s gallery. Crimson satin sophas and curtains, easy and rocking chairs. Statues from a Colossal Apollo Belvidere to a naked woman on her knees, modern portraits and Italian paintings— Engravings of the Transfiguration and Guido’s Aurora, with Durand’s Declaration of Independence, and Trumbull’s Bunker hill were all clustered together but well disposed by the taste of Mrs Edward Brooks— After dinner, a very young man preached from Ecclesiastes. 1.–2 “All is vanity.” Soon after that services a succession of visitors— Closed the day— Harriet Welsh. Degrand at tea— Then Mr P. C. Brooks—and Edward Brooks’s Son. "

Monday—  Mr Savage, President of the Massachusetts historical Society called and I had a long conversation with him; chiefly upon a question fit only to make a learned body ridiculous by forming a subject for divided opinions and even of controversy. That is, on the day for the ceremony.— The day of the confederation was 19. May 1643— The day chosen for the celebration is the 29th. of May because at that time the difference between the Calenders was only ten days— But the difference is now two days more, and I told Mr Savage that as the 19th. of May of old Style of the present year is the 31st. of the new Style, I thought they should take the 31st. for the celebration— But he and judge Davis, have settled the point between themselves upon principle— He argued it with me astronomically and politically with such lucid illustration, that I lost the thread of his syllogism, and finally did not understand him at all. I went to visit Dr Frothingham, who was not at home, and I called on George Bancroft. I found Robert C. Winthrop with him, and of course we talked history— They were endeavouring to ascertain the relation between Sir John Temple, Winthrops grand-father and the Grenville family—of which I was surprized to see, Winthrop apparently not at all informed— Mr Bancroft had a number of manuscript Letters, which Edward Everett has collected for him, from Burke, Fox, Champion, Dr Franklin, Arthur Lee &c written in 1774—and among the rest a copy of Thomas Hutchinson’s account of his private interview, with King George the 3d. in July 1774. on Hutchinson’s first arrival from this country— He was introduced by Lord Dartmouth, and was upwards of two hours long with the king— Much of the dialogue, was upon the detection and exposure by Dr Franklin of Hutchinson’s Letters, upon which the king said that there was not a word in them at which any just exception could be taken— Bancroft told me that from this paper and all the other disclosures to which he has obtained of the real character of Hutchinson, he had come to the same conclusion that my father did—that he was a bad man.— This afternoon I had again a long professional visit from Dr Bigelow, and a discussion upon the proper regimen and treatment of the incurable disease with which I am afflicted, and for which I believe great abstemiousness and he thinks good living the appropriate, and only appropriate palliative remedy— He still persists in his opinion, and I shall conform myself to it, as long, and as well as I can— Dr George Parkman came to see me. He did not know that I was in the city till this morning— My intercourse with him is always friendly without alloy, and nothing more— At close of day I went with Charles’s wife in to their next door neighbour’s Mr Samuel D. Parker, and saw him—his daughter—niece and two sons, the youngest of whom is a student at the University. Visit afterwards from Mr Schuyler—of New-York. "

No Relaxation of my disease— The repose of the Night broken as it has been every night since the return of my complaint.— But I rose this morning at 4. and was on my way to see the Sun rise from the S.E. corner of Charles’s house; when I found half his disk above the horizon— His first ray appeared 4:37.— I wrote upon my address for the anniversary—without any satisfaction, and under a deep impression of dulness beyond all redemption— The day was fair and the weather on the whole warm—though I had a small fire made. I visited my seedling trees— For these fifteen years I have seen, every year sowing in confusion which I have often and vainly endeavoured to methodize, the seeds of many fruit and forest trees— I have been here only a part of every year, and I have never paid due scientific regard to them— I have neglected all the instructions of Du Hamel, Forsyth, Loudon, and the other writers upon planting and dendrology— The result is that after numberless disappointments and the thorough failure of about 9/10ths. of my experiments I have perhaps one hundred trees growing from seeds sown by my own hands, and which if left unmolested where they now stand may survive me a full century and bear fruit for those who shall come after me— Of these, the only ones in which I now take much interest, are young apple trees, some just beginning to bear and others fit stocks for engrafting good fruit upon them.— About half a dozen pear stocks—one red oak 12 feet high and one foot in circumference, a dozen or more other Oaks, black, white and chesnut all neglected— Sundry elms and ash of which I might have a forest. Sundry cherries, most of them in bloom, but not having yet born fruit— Three maples the seeds of which I brought from Philadelphia in May 1836. and sowed on the first of June of that year. It is a comfort to me to leave these growing upon my grounds, and the sight of my trees bursting into bloom gives me the solitary pleasure that I enjoy in returning to this peaceful abode. I dined alone; and this afternoon my Son came out from Boston, with all his family to keep house with me, till he can get his own house upon the hill prepared for their reception— I got through my daily task of yesterday’s journal, and two pages of my address for the centennial— But this last sickens me to the heart and must prove a grievous failure— I am now wading through a comparative statement of the democratic ingredients of the four New-England Colonies which united in the confederacy of 1643. and find it hard to labour through.

I took last Night before going to bed by way of experiment a tumbler of wine whey, and it did not succeed— It aggravated my cough, and heated me without producing a perspiration— I rose in time to go over and see the sun rise from the corner of Charles’s house at 4.36. The restlessness of the Night somewhat dispirited me for punctuality to my labours so that I did not complete the two pages of my address for the day, nor finish my diary for yesterday, but by writing this evening till my bed time. But I spent between two and three of the best hours of the day, in going with John Kirk round my Garden and Nursery—trimming some of my trees, plucking up others, and preparing for clearing off the useless trees now stunting the growth of the precious ones—those for which I anticipate the longest lives are the shagbark walnuts of which I have about 20 from 12 to 2 years old, and the sight of which is a reward for all the labour I have wasted in raising tree, from the seed— In making up my summary of the 4 New-England Colonies which formed the confederacy of 1643. I have to consult numerous writers as well those nearly cotemporaneous as of later ages— Hutchinson is my standing leader, and often after finding, a very brief notice of my special object of enquiry, in him, with a reference to others for further enquiry, I stroll off to Hazard’s State papers, to Hinman’s Connecticut Antiquities, to Farmer’s Registers to Chalmers of Holmes Annals, to sundry volumes of the Collections of the Historical Society—and to others which I have not yet been able to gather. I return to the short notice in Hutchinson, and perceive not that I have much enlarged my stock of knowledge— Dr Holmes’s Annals are copious of facts—and they are what I want to know with most precision— I seek particularly the why and the when the Colonies of Connecticut and of New-Haven were organized and established— There is much modification of the history caused by the various phases of the revolution and restoration in of the Stuart family in England— I took up this day the Volume of Bancroft’s history recently published, and find a new colouring given to every incident, and a new gloss to every character— There is in every line of Bancroft a struggle to magnify the importance of events and of persons giving an air of pomposity to his whole Story— This afternoon I took a ride in the Carriage with Mrs Charles and her baby Arthur, to Braintree, where she finally found Miss Sampson, and engaged her to come, and work for her, the second week in June— Evening visit from Mr Beale— Short for I was drowsy.

Friday  Having no time to spare for the composition of my address for the Massachusetts historical Society, and deeming it necessary for the filling of the time allotted to the discourse, that it should consist of 32 pages, occupying two pages or thereabouts I begin the day with that labour, and prescribing to myself to write two pages each day till I get through— I began therefore this morning as soon after rising dressing and making my fire was practicable, and with the interval of half an hour for breakfast kept incessant alternate reading and writing, till the village bell rung for noon before my task for the day was completed— In the course of my treatment of the subject I was this day brought to the consideration of the character of Roger Williams and the establishment of the Colony of Rhode-Island— It has in recent times become a sort of literary fashion to extol the character of Roger Williams, by disparaging those of the Massachusetts with whom he contended. I have suspected that there is in this much injustice; and the more minutely I examine his controversy with them, the more firmly this opinion fixes itself in my mind— Roger Williams was a Welshman— He came sharpened for controversy, a polemical porcupine from Oxford, an extreme puritan quilled with all the quarrelsome metaphysical divinity of the age— He arrived eight months after Winthrop and his company and began by preaching at Salem that the Charter was of no avail, because the king had no power to grant the lands because they belonged to the Indians, and that the Church was no true Church because she had not proclaimed her repentance for having held Communion with the Church of England before the Emigration— These doctrines struck at the vitals of the Massachusetts Colony, civil and ecclesiastical— If there is any thing surprizing in their treatment of him, it was their lenity towards him— His principle of liberty of conscience admirable in itself, was utterly at variance with itself in his excommunication of the colonial church for not excommunicating the episcopal church of England— Altogether he was a mere boute-feu and they were amply justified in getting rid of him. I see that Bancroft tells his Story with extreme partiality to puff him up—not only to a Saint and Hero; but to a transcendent Genius— A Newton, Kepler, or Copernicus. His principle of Toleration was the inspiration of a strong mind, and his success in settling a small colony where it was carried into practise gives lustre to his name— The recent revolution in Rhode-Island, is the Euthanasia of his system— My son, took his daughter Louisa to Boston with him to Boston and returned to dine. And after dinner I took a ride in the Carriage with his wife and youngest son Arthur. "

A Letter from R. F. Barnard President of the Berkshire County Agricultural Society, dated Sheffield May 18. inviting me to prepare and deliver an address before them at their annual Fair to be held on the first Wednesday and Thursday of next October. 2.

Sunday  My cough has very much subsided, and I went to bed last Night without a fit of coughing, and awoke this morning with a very light one— Mr Lunt preached this morning from Luke 12.15—[“]for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth”—and Romans 8.6.—“to be spiritually minded is life and peace.”— Mr Lunt considered the second of these texts as an exposition of the first— The life of man he said was different from that of all merely material beings— The life of beasts and birds and fishes and all the animated creation consisted of the circulation of material elements—and in this sense there was a life in plants—perishable by the lapse of time but life in man was the conscious existence of the immortal soul, and therefore could not consist in the abundance of a man’s earthly possessions.— Mr Lunt gave notice that the afternoon service would be performed by a blind person named Bowen—who had been earnestly recommended to him by several of his professional brethren at the South, as every way, worthy of encouragement and kindness. He said that Mr Bowen, had been admitted to the pulpits of many churches in this neighbourhood, and had preached as he was informed to general acceptance.— He had thought it his duty to give him the same opportunity, and as Mr Bowen had no other means of providing for his subsistence, after his discourse a collection would be taken up for his benefit— Mr E. Price Greenleaf walked home with me— After dinner, Mr Bowen, the blind man preached from John 9.2. “And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 3. Jesus answered, neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.”— Is there not in this answer an explicit declaration that the phyical infirmities and diseases of men are not to be considered as visitations of heaven upon them in punishment for transgression— Yet it is scarcely to be denied that there are punishments inflicted by heaven for sins upon earth— Mr Bowen’s discourse was intellectual as much as might be expected from one habitually living with knowledge at one entrance quite shut out.— Mr Bowen gave some statistics of blindness in different countries, and presented their plea for compassion without overcharge or exaggeration.— In thanking the auditory for their patience he repeated the notice given this morning by Mr Lunt, that he had no other means of obtaining his subsistence, but his preaching, and a liberal contribution was taken up for his benefit— "

                "text": "22— IV. Monday.  I find myself with the most unremitting labour unable to accomplish the daily task of writing two pages of my address, and equally so of fixing any point of view, in which the New England Colonial confederacy can be made interesting.— My acquaintance with the details of the original settlement of New England is very slender, and being now under the obligation to look them up, the streams of information are so copious, that they absorb all my time— The confederacy of 1643 was a defensive league against the Indians—my first duty was to trace the separate origin of the five New-England Colonies, including that of Rhode-Island and Providence plantations, which was not admitted into the league— Then I was cast upon the controversy concerning the life and character of Roger Williams. Next I came to the investigation of the Colonial Wars with the Indians— This plunges me into the historical collections of the Massachusetts, and of the Rhode Island historical Societies—of the Massachusetts Collections there are 28 volumes already published and of the Rhode Island collections 4: The Massachusetts collections are rich in original publications respecting the New England Indians, and the Wars of the European Colonists with them. In the first volume there is a work by Daniel Gookin, entitled Historical collections of the Indians of New-England of which I made this day the discovery, and which occupied hours of my time— The work is dedicated in December 1674. to Charles the 2d with an Epistle to Robert Boyle and the Society in London for propagating the gospel among the Indians, and another epistle to the reader— In the second Chapter of this work there is an enumeration of five tribes embracing all the tribes inhabiting New England when the English colonies were first settled, and continuing to exist half a century afterwards when Gookin wrote— This Daniel Gookin was father to Elizabeth Gookin, second wife of the second Edmund Quincy, ancestor of President Josiah Quincy. His first wife was Joanna Hoare, mother of Daniel Quincy and thereby my ancestor— I am yet to explore the narratives of the Indian Wars as originating causes of the New-England confederacy, and in the mean time, my address drags its slow length along. I took a ride this afternoon round through Braintree with my daughter and her baby Arthur.— Elizabeth C. Adams took tea here. They came from Medford on Saturday. We have the melancholy tidings of the death of Mr Whittemore the husband of Louisa De Wint, leaving two infant children. "

Charles went to Boston with his daughter Louisa, and returned to dine— Mr Robinson the Minister of the episcopal church in this town called on me this morning and requested me to attend the Fair, at the vestry under the Church this afternoon, and to address the company who might be there. After dinner I rode with Mrs Charles and Arthur to Mrs T. B. Adams’s; left them there— Took up Elizabeth C. Adams and went to the Church vestry Fair— There were about twenty women there with tables before them covered with small articles for sale, and five or six men, and sundry children— The Fair is a small device for taxing the pockets of visitors for contributions— An expedient of beggary humble enough but growing stale— I purchased two or three petty articles; Mr Robinson who had formally announced me when I entered asked me again to let the ladies hear my voice— My voice was in no condition to speak, and I declined— I had in truth nothing to say; and knew not what to say— I returned with Elizabeth to Mrs T. B. Adams’s Took up Mrs Charles and the baby, and rode down to the Mount Wollaston beach where I am always reminded of the barge into which I enteredFebruary 1778 to embark in the Boston Frigate for France, and of my landing on the 2d. of August 1779 from the pinnace of the French frigate La Sensible on the same beach—65 years have passed away since the first of those events— Nearly 64 since the second— What changes of the globe and of man in that interval— The beach seems to be the same— We took Elizabeth home, and then came home. Evening call from Benjamin Owen Tyler—coming now from Duxbury where he has been varnishing for Gershom B. Weston— I was benumbed—and torpid, and fell asleep while Mr Tyler was talking, and slept till after he went away— I had been labouring all day, at the New-England confederacy of 1643. and made very little progress.

Wednesday  Disastrous fire in Quincy—  Mr Benjamin Owen Tyler was again here this morning with his century of inventions for raising the wind— His principal project now is an engraved print for a temperance pledge certificate, ornamented with the portraits of sundry reformed drunkards, or according to the latest vocabulary, inebriates— He also convinced me by dint of persuasion, to let him varnish some of my old pictures. A person by the name of Alexander Wolcott Stow, formerly of Connecticut, now of Milwaukie, in the territory of Wiskonsin, came to see me and to have some conversation with me; as he said merely for the pleasure of it— A friend of Liberty Deacon Spear called also, and proposed to me at some future day to visit my territories, to which I agreed without naming a day. There was a fire in the Town this day, between Noon and One O’Clock, which consumed several dwelling houses, at some distance from each other— First caught from a foul chimney, and then carried by the wind in burning cinders from house to house.— Clift Rogers and Cotton Pratt, a Carpenter are two of the sufferers who lost their houses— After dinner I rode to Milton with my daughter and her boy Arthur—stop’d on our return at Mrs T. B. Adams’s to enquire how they were— Barely recovering from their fright— The fire was close in their neighbourhood, and their house was in imminent danger of being kindled— My progress to the completion of my Address to the Massachusetts Historical Society was suspended by my examination of the volumes of the Collections of the Society, for publications relating to the subject.

Mr Tyler continues his varnishing atchievements and this day dined with us— An Irish woman of one of the families burnt out of the Faxon house came to plead her own cause with all the eloquence of distress, but she could not pronounce her own name so that I could remember it.— After dinner I rode with Charles and his wife to Roxbury to the garden of an Englishman named Walker at Roxbury, where he has sundry beds of tulips after the fashion of those at Haerlem in Holland— In one bed under a glass-frame there were 1200 bulbs with the stalk and cups, in every variety of colouring and of cost— We met there Mr Edward Brooks with his mother in Law, Mrs Boott, his wife and daughter— There was a printed advertisement of a sale at auction of all these plants one day next week— In one part of the bed Mr Brooks was noticing two of the tulips near together, as being remarkably handsome, when Mr Walker observed that the difference in value between them was of fifty cents and fifty dollars— I thought the fifty cent one the handsomest of the two— The wild and extravagant and most capricious taste for tulips is not yet extinct— Returning home just after crossing Neponsett Bridge, my fingers were so pinched with cold that I alighted from the carriage and walked two miles home; Charles’s son John Quincy came down from the Coachman’s box, and walked with me— The day for the delivery of my address is now so near at hand that I am excessively pressed for time to conclude. I have come at last to an abstract of the Articles of the New England confederacy with the view of closing by a parallel between them and the present North American confederation of the United States—but the attempt has brought me to a conviction of failing faculties so exquisitely painful, that I am tempted to wish that a return of my habitual disease may totally disqualify me for the performance on Monday and save me from the mortification of self exposure.

                "text": "27. V.15 Saturday.  The Sun rose clear, but I was yet in bed. And the sky soon clouded up for a Northeaster with showers of rain through the day— I came in my address to the parallel between the New-England confederacy of 1643. and the North-American confederacy of 1774.— I had some hopes on approaching this topic to bring up some interest with it—but it sinks under me— Not one of the motives which stimulated the puritans of 1643 to their confederacy of 1643 had the slightest influence in actuating the confederacy of 1774. The parties to the New-England Union were homogeneous— Those of the North-American Union were not only of heterogeneous but of hostile elements; and in the latter there was the ingredient of Slavery which poisoned the whole composition— I have touched upon it in this address; but on revisal propose to strike out all that I have written relating to it— This afternoon I rode with my daughter and her son Charles to Weymouth to enquire of the state of Mrs Mercy Tufts who has been very dangerously ill with the Erisypelas— We saw her two daughters Mercy and Susan, who told us she was somewhat better, though still confined to her bed— We rode home with a sprinkling rain and the evening was wintry cold— This family of Tufts are all that now remain of my childhood’s remembrance of Weymouth— Some of the earliest of my recollections are there, and the localities which remain unchanged bring them back, with a pungency for which I scarcely know how to account— I have no such reminiscences in Boston, because every thing there is changed; but spots of the old road through Braintree and Weymouth are precisely as they were seventy years ago—and a return to them seems to sweep away the interval of time, and to make me again a child— But there is not one individual of my grandfather Smith’s blood now living in Weymouth— Collections of the Massachusetts historical Society— Second Series Vol. 9.

[“]God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets.”— A Dissertation upon the Hebrew prophets. This subject has perhaps not been fully explored— Mr Lunt noticed the division made by the Jews of their sacred books into the historical, the poetical and the prophetical— The latter including only the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel Daniel and the twelve minor prophets— But the term prophet is of much more extensive signification in the old testament than to include the authors of the sixteen prophetical books.— The Patriarchs Abraham Isaac and Jacob were prophets— The kings Saul and David and Solomon were prophets. During the time of the judges the prophets were called Seers; and in the case of Balaam, there is a description of the manner of their visions (Numbers 24.16) The prophet fell into a trance, but had his eyes open—and then he saw visions, and heard voices—and what he heard he was obliged to repeat— In the days of the kings there were schools of the prophets whence it would seem it was considered as an art or Science to be taught by human instruction. But the word of the Lord came indiscriminately to persons of all conditions, and the prophet Amos was among the herdmen of Tekoa— One of the greatest prophets was Elijah, of whom there are now no writings left and it is remarkable that the 16. prophets whose writings are included in the Bible, all lived very shortly before or during the Babylonian captivity. By the Law of Moses, (Deuteronomy 13 and 18) a false prophet if he spoke in the name of the Lord—and a true prophet if he spoke in the name of any other God were to be put to death— The test of a true prophet who spoke in the name of the Lord was that his predictions should come to pass— And there was a promise that the Lord would raise up a prophet, like unto Moses; but it was not said when and the modern Christian commentators have concluded that this promise was fulfilled by the advent of Jesus Christ— But he, and by his declaration even John the Baptist was more than a prophet. Mr Lunt gave notice that the communion would be administered next Sunday. Mr Edward Brooks junr came out from Boston and dined with us. After dinner Mr Hall of Dorchester preached from Acts 16.30. “what must I do to be saved?” There was something startling in the text, but Mr Hall thought it a question, which every Christian ought to put to himself, every day and every hour of his life.— But he did not very distinctly define what he understood by being saved— He is no believer of eternal damnation— I this day painfully brought to a conclusion my address, to be delivered to-morrow before the Massachusetts Historical Society.

Mr Thomas Greenleaf called on me this morning, with a copy of a lease executed in 1839 of a lot of land belong to the Adams temple and school corporation for 20 years on a ground lent of 6. dollars a year— There was a condition inserted in the draught of the deed that at the termination of the lease, if the parties could not agree upon its renewal the corporation should take the buildings erected by the lessee, at an equitable apprizement— The supervisors of the fund disapproved of this condition; and directed that another should be done. But from the loose and careless manner in which the business of this corporation, and indeed of most others is transacted the conclusion of the deed has been neglected and protracted to this day—once signed and sealed by the selectmen, and acknowledged before a justice of the peace; but by unaccountable negligence without signature of witnesses; so that it must be done all over again— An admonition which ought not to be overlooked— Charles went into Boston to attend a Collation furnished by the Unitarian laymen of Boston to the Clergy of their denomination. This is a yearly festival; at which there were this day 815 persons of both sexes present— Charles presided as a delegate from Dr Frothingham’s Society at one of 8 tables.— The entertainment consisted of cold meats, tea and coffee— No wine or Spirits, but addresses and songs— I rode this afternoon with Mrs Charles, her Sons Charles, Henry and Arthur with his Nurse Becca—we stop’d at Mr John Greenleaf’s; and saw him and Mrs Greenleaf and their two daughters Mrs Lucy Dawes and Mrs Mary Dawes—after which we rode round the Braintree square, and when we reached home found Charles returned from Boston— I visited my garden, Nursery and seminary, and examined my seedling trees, many of which exhibit appearances, for which I cannot account— Almost all my peach-trees are winter killed; and among them several of two and three years old; and till now of the fairest promise— On the other hand the cherries all flourish more than I have ever known them to do before— The black walnuts often before blighted are uncommonly thrifty now: and the oaks and Shagbark walnuts differ so much that numbers of them have put forth a vigorous growth, while others after opening a beautiful foliage have already withered and are irretrievably blasted— The apples make as yet the fairest show.

May containing several long Articles, sounding the trumpet of alarm at the symptoms recently manifested in Texas of a strong party with a fixed design to abolish Slavery— The Bee has the name of Henry Clay on its first page nominated as its candidate for the presidency but its groans at the prospect of abolition in Texas are agonizing.— Mr Andrews is a native of Massachusetts, but at present an inhabitant of Texas— He is the person mentioned in the Letter from Joseph Eve, to the Secretary of State shewn to me by Mr Hunter on the 14th. of April— Eve related that this person had come from Austin to Galveston to make a speech in public urging the expediency and necessity of abolishing Slavery. But that an assemblage of people had gone to him at his lodgings, taken him by force and landed him at Virginia point on the opposite bank of the river. Mr Andrews says this was true; but that the men who committed this outrage upon him were a gang of not more than 20 persons; not at all authorised or supported by the People—and that he afterwards returned to Galveston, openly avowing his abolition opinions without meeting any ill treatment or opposition— He says he knows that the Texan President Houston is in favour of the abolition— He is now about to embark in the Steamer Caledonia to morrow for England, with a view to obtain the aid of the British Government to the cause— Mr Tappan asked me if I would furnish him with Letters of recommendation, which I declined having no correspondent in England with whom I could take the Liberty: but I bade him God speed and told him, that I believed the freedom of this country and of all mankind depended upon the direct, formal, open and avowed interference of Great-Britain to accomplish the abolition of Slavery in Texas. But that I distrusted the Sincerity of the present British Administration in the Anti-slavery cause. Mr Andrews offered to write to me, to inform me how his propositions may be received, which I accepted— Mr Tappan told me he had himself been urged to go to England and asked my advice what he should do— I declined advising; but said I wished he would go; were it only for the possibility that he might contribute to advance the cause— Edward and Mrs Brooks, with their daughter and Mrs Frothingham came out this afternoon and took tea with us.

I find myself already falling into idleness as always happens after I have completed a compulsive task, and am left without another bearing upon me— The luxury of my life is desultory reading, and my library furnishes irresistible temptation to variety of enjoyment— My first duty now is to answer Letters of invitation to deliver Orations, Lectures and Addresses, and I began with that of B. R. Curtis for an Address to the Alumni of Harvard University on the day before the next Commencement— The next was from R. F. Barnard President of the Berkshire County Agricultural Society, inviting me to deliver an Address to that Society at their annual meeting next October—to both these I wrote and despatched declining answers—but in addition to the Berkshire invitation there is a Letter from Charles Sedgwick and 49 others dated at Lenox, and another from Thaddeus Pomeroy and 22 others at Stockbridge which I ought to have answered this day but postponed till to-morrow— A man by the name of Matthias Rich, blind, came, led by his Son, a boy about 12 years of age came to beg. He had an old certificate of respectability and of indigence dated in 1839. and signed by John Reed the former member of Congress from Barnstable County— He said that he had a family of several children to support, and no other means but the bounty of the charitable to assist him; which from time to time he went round to solicit, though it was a very mortifying occupation— Mr Tyler too came again this afternoon and resumed his volunteer task of varnishing all over the house every thing upon which he could lay his hand— I rode out this afternoon with Mrs Charles and her Son Charles— We stop’d at Mrs T. B. Adams’s and left a Letter from Mrs De Windt to her in reply to condolence on the decease of Mr Whittemore— The Letter announces also the birth of a Son to Mrs Van Wagenen, who was Julia the third daughter of Mrs De Windt— We then round by the Railway Stone Church. After our return, Mr Thomas J. Noyes with his brother came to enquire what had been done in Congress on the petition of their Grandmother Mary Pike for a pension; of which I had taken charge, 14. Novr last— Her husband was killed at Bunker’s hill— I told them that a Bill in her favour had passed the house of Representatives, but I believe had failed in the Senate—but not having with me the Acts of the last Session of Congress I was unable to answer the enquiry with certainty— I attended this Evening at the town hall an anatomical lecture by a young man named Lambert—chiefly against the compression of the chest, by straight-lacing—from 8 to 1/2 past 9— "

I answered the Letters of Charles Sedgwick and Thaddeus Pomeroy, but continued idle with miscellaneous reading, and believing that I must prepare a Lecture for the next Autumn, meditated upon a biographical sketch of Lord Bacon of Nicholas Machiavel, of Ignatius Loyola and Blaise Pascal, either of which seems to afford a good subject for a moral and entertaining Lecture— But if this is ever to be carried into execution it must be preceded by much reading. I took up the life of Bacon in the first Volume of the Quarto Edition of his works, and read about an hour. I met Mr E. Price Greenleaf in my garden, and walked round with him examining my seedling trees.— I mourned the number of various kinds and ages apparently killed by the recent frosts after putting forth their foliage with cheering promise— Of the Baldwin Apple trees from Medford, two at least have holes of the borer worm two or three inches above the ground— Several of them bore largely last autumn, and we have now as many as a peck of them in sound condition, daily on the dining table. Of the Shagbark walnut there arein the Nurseryin the Garden andin the seminary which I have hope will outlive me more than a century— The peaches and button woods have a dreary and haggard appearance—many of them entirely dead.— Mr Greenleaf brought back a number of books that he had borrowed and asked for others—among which Montesquieu and Machiavel in French and Italian— This last I have not. but I found in the town’s library an English translation of Machiavel’s works, not including the plays; in 4. 8vo. volumes by Ellis Farneworth published in 1775— I looked especially for the Prince and found it with a translation of the Anti-Machiavel, by Frederic 2. king of Prussia, printed alternately chapter by chapter— Several of which I read—first the cunning Italian, and then the royal German-French commentator. Charles went to Boston, and returned to dine— He brought information of the arrival of our chests and trunks and boxes, ship’d at Georgetown in the brig Elizabeth Captain Baker, but fraudulently landed at Salem— He brought me also a Letter from Mr Savage, President of the Massachusetts Historical Society, with a vote of thanks of the Society for the Discourse on the New England Confederacy, and a request of a copy for the press. Mr Tyler was here varnishing— Ruth Turner to work— Elizabeth C. Adams to dine—and we rode to Milton after dinner. "

                "text": "3. IV. Saturday  Mr Tyler continues to favour us with volunteer varnishing—and this day wrought almost a metempsecosis on the full length portrait of my great grandfather John Quincy, at two years of age, painted in 1691. and left by his Son Norton Quincy, who died 29. September 1801— He brought me also a Boston Notion of this morning, containing a report of the celebration of last Monday; with seven columns of my discourse from the Notes of the Reporter— There are many mistakes, of the meaning; but I believe it scarcely possible that a more correct report of a speech nearly two hours long, should be taken from the lips of the Speaker.— I despatched 3 Letters of apology, for declining to deliver the address before the Berkshire County Agricultural Society next October— Mr E. Price Greenleaf came and returned more of the books that he had borrowed; and took from the Town’s library the 6. volumes of the works of Montesquieu in duodecimo and 2. volumes of Italian History. I read several chapters of Machiavel’s Prince, and the examen of the same by Frederic of Prussia.— I believe that a profound examination of both would form an instructive and entertaining occupation for this and the next Month—why should I not undertake it?— Machiavel, was a republican, Florentine Statesman of the 15th. Century— Frederic the 2d. a German Prussian King of the 18th. and Voltaire a French Man of Letters and universal Genius of the same age— Frederic wrote his Anti-Machiavel, while he was a Prince, and before he became a king.— He wrote in the French language, and the first edition of his work was published by Voltaire in Holland. The morality of Machiavel characterizes his Age and country; and is congenial to the doctrines of papal Rome at the time when Luther first raised the standard of religious reformation.— Machiavel was born 1469. and Luther 1483. and Ignatius Loyola 1491.— Comparing the Chapters of the Prince with the Examen of Frederic, the Royal commentator has greatly the advantage—but Voltaire in the posthumous Memoirs of his own life, charges Frederic with practising on the doctrines of Machiavel, however indignantly denouncing them in his youthful writings— The infidel spirit of the 18th. century is apparent in the treatise of Frederic, though more gauze covered in the second edition published by himself, than in the first published by Voltaire.— The cold weather continues, but while we were at dinner there was a heavy shower of rain, accompanied with distant thunder— It deprived us of the afternoon, and kept me at work, writing— At evening twilight however I walked up the hill, but the roads were so muddy that I was obligated to abridge my walk and come in— I shingled this day my seedling English Oaks to save them from the Sun.

The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?” It was a communion day Sermon, and after preaching it he administered the communion, of which I partook— There is a peculiar solemnity in this religious rite, which in the most impressive manner admonishes every sincere Christian of his duties to God, and to his neighbour; and especially of the duty of goodwill to all mankind— There is something strange and mysterious in the history of the institution of the Jewish Passover—and of the substitution of this sacrament in its stead— On the night of the going forth of the children of Israel from Egypt, the destroying angel had smitten all the first born of the Egyptians— There was not a house but had a dead body in it: but the angel had passed over all the houses of the Israelites, and in commemoration of that double deliverance, on the very night of the Exodus, Moses commanded that their religious year should commence with that month, and that every family should annually sacrifice a lamb, and feed upon it in remembrance of that wonderful event. Subsequent regulations of divine appointment had prescribed that this annual festival should be held at Jerusalem, and 1500 years after the establishment of the passover Jesus went up to that city to keep the passover with his disciples— There it was, while at supper that he disclosed the secret of his own destiny, and considering himself as the paschal lamb, sacrificed for the sins and deliverance of mankind—he told his disciples by a figure of oriental imagery that the bread was his flesh, and the wine his blood, which they must annually eat and drink in remembrance of him— And now after 3300 years, the Jewish Passover is yet annually celebrated in the form of an annual memorial of the ignominious death and glorious resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth— And once in every one or two months it is repeated by Christians even of the purest and most spiritual denomination. Mr Lunt announced and prayed for one new communicant, Samuel White— After dinner he preached again from John 3.8. “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one who is born of the Spirit”— The spiritual nature of Christianity is a topic to which Mr Lunt very frequently returns— After Meeting I rode with Mrs Charles and her child Arthur to Germantown, and was reminded by the name of Palmer Street of the old General, once settled there.

The wind came round yesterday to the South and this morning when I rose before the Sun; thin clouds were scudding across the sky from South to North, followed by a dense fog, which soon cleared off, for a forenoon of high Summer heat— I took the opportunity to visit my seedling trees in the garden, nursery and seminary.— The exercise and the thermometer soon urged me back into the house. Of the multitude of English Oak acorns sown last October five or six have sprung up, the last week in May.— None since—and there as many more slender stalks, three or four inches high which came up last summer, and have survived the winter, and opened their leaves, but shew no manifestation of growth, the present Season— To keep these alive through another winter is my present ambition; but the black jack Oak is again winter killed nearly down to the surface of the ground— It is putting forth new shoots, but doubtful whether they will get headway to survive the next winter— The most extraordinary growth of the present year is that of my shagbark walnuts— Then the cherries, and the black walnuts; which seldom thrive here.— I had scarcely returned to my chamber when the wind shifted to the eastward and the afternoon and evening were cold and rainy— I answered a Letter from my wife, and before closing it received another from her, dated the first of this month, which will require further answer. I received also a Letter from William Hayden joint editor of the Boston Atlas, offering to publish in that paper, my Discourse on the New England confederacy; which I declined, having promised a copy for publication to the Society— I had also received last week a Letter from George Sullivan at New-York enquiring if I would deliver an Address before the American Institute of New-York, next November— I answered this day and declined. I resume the notice of the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society— Third Series Vol. 1— Hutchinson papers, continued from the last Volume p. 1–152 Seven Letters of Roger Williams p. 159–178— Two Letters of Hugh Peters p. 179–180. Letters of William Hooke p. 181. and of John Maidston p. 185–198 to Governor John Winthrop of Connecticut— History of the Nanhiganset Country p. 209–228— Letter of John Haynes to John Winthrop p. 229.— 3 Letters of Henry Jacie to John Winthrop junr p. 235–245.

Editor of the Quincy Patriot, brought me a small volume elegantly bound with my name on the outside binding published by Casserly and Sons 108 Nassau Street New-York: with a flattering, complimentary note from the publishers— The book is entitled A Memoir of Ireland Native and Saxon, by Daniel O’Connell M.P. Vol. 1. 1172–1660— These are Roman Catholic publishers; but I know not how to account for their extraordinary kindness to me— Mr Green had also a slip from a Berkshire Newspaper containing 4 Stanzas of poetry with my name as the author. He asked if they were mine— They were the Stanza’s 3–6. of Dermot MacMorrogh—Canto 2. Green intimated that he intended to republish them in the Quincy Patriot— I visited my seedling trees, and noted the first appearance of one more English Oak— I trimmed a young button-wood and took off a stake which I planted to ascertain if it will grow.— I answered at last a Letter, which has been waiting for an answer for 12 days. After dinner I rode with Mrs Charles and her boy Arthur to Mount Wollaston, and after we returned I had a visit from John G. Whittier. He had agreed to serve as Editor of the Emancipator during the absence of Mr Leavitt; but that engagement is cancelled and at the close of this week he returns to his residence at Amesbury— He spoke of the teeming projects of our Southern politicians for the annexation of Texas to this Union; and for the counter projects in Texas for the abolition of Slavery there— I told him my reasons for distrusting the sincerity of the British Government with regard to Slavery and Texas; the commercial interest and policy of Great-Britain, sympathising far more with our Southern than with the Northern States— Past Midshipman John Quincy Adams 2d. came in this Evening with his Sister Elizabeth— He has a short furlough and from the Razee Independence of the home Squadron, has been transferred to the command of the Sloop of War Decatur—ordered to the Station, on the Coast of Africa— Collections of the Massachusetts historical Society Third Series.

I saw the Sun rise again from the S.E. corner of my Son’s house, but it went soon into a cloud which thickened the whole day and sprinkled rain in the evening. Mr Forbes of Milton called on me this forenoon and introduced to me a Mr Delano recently returned from China— He speaks doubtfully of the results of the late War of Great Britain against China. My Son returned before dinner from the whig convention at Worcester, where yesterday they first nominated John Davis as the whig candidate for Governor— Mr Davis positively and peremptorily declined the nomination; whereupon they nominated George N. Briggs for Governor and John Read of Yarmouth for Lieutenant Governor— There was a suspension of hostilities between the Clay and Webster fragments of the whig party, which are already bitterly exasperated against each other— Webster has undertaken to dragoon the whigs of this State from their allegiance to Henry Clay, whom he proposes to supplant, as a supplementary candidate for the Presidency; by a double coalition with John Tyler and John C. Calhoun— His first movements in this new system of policy, have demolished the prospects of Clay, and driven John Davis into retirement, but have gone near to demolish also Webster’s own party— The result thus far has been to throw the State into the hands of Marcus Morton and the radical democracy— This is but a step to that flagitious coalition which is to prostrate the freedom of this Union before its Slavery. What am I to do in this struggle? to flinch ingloriously from it? or to perish in fruitless resistance ag against it? Is it not a craven Spirit, that holds me still in suspense on this mighty movement upon the history of man. Miss Welsh came out with Charles from Boston— I took a ride with her and Mrs Charles and her this afternoon— We left her at Mrs Torrey’s and after a tour round the old roads in Braintree, took her up again at Mrs T. B.

Johnson— His condition is so critical, that his Sisters feared if the Letter should be communicated to him it might snap the attenuated thread of his life— Yet they did not dare to break the seal to ascertain its contents, and my wife enclosed it to me with a request that I would return it to Mr Smith, and intimate to him that if he has any application to make to Mr Johnson, it would be advisable that he should make it through me— I enclosed accordingly Mr Smith’s Letter back to himself and answered the one from my wife.— Mr Curtis came just before our dinnertime; and having dined before he left home abridged his visit. I agreed to meet him between 10 and 11 to morrow morning at my Son’s office in Boston— We have a final answer to give to Petty Vaughan of London who exacts a bond of indemnity from us for his own unauthorised transactions as a condition to his payment of a large sum in his hands, due to us as Executors of Ward N.

In the ride, I observed that the red Cedar trees have shared the fate of the button wood or Sycamores— They are all dying, and no one knows why— Multitudes of my Peach trees, are in the same condition. But what annoys me still more is the habit I am forming of wasting time on morning Newspapers—Garden, Nursery and Seminary forenoon visits; and siesta’s followed by an after dinner ride, and do nothing evenings This mode of life palsies the whole day—leaving me scarcely the two hours for the journal record, and one more for reading of Machiavel, and Ignatius Loyola—or to notice the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society— Third Series.

Peter 5.7. “Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.” The Doctrine of a special Providence seems to be congenial to that of guardian Angels; of Cherubim and Seraphim, and an innumerable company of Angels and Archangels— Ministering Spirits, intimated somewhat obscurely in all parts of the Scriptures, and blended with that of evil Spirits, the theory of which is organized by the poetical imagination of John Milton, so that my old Law master Theophilus Parsons used to say that he considered the Paradise lost, as a narrative of facts of equal authenticity with the Bible— But then if the universal cause, acts not by partial but by general Laws, in what sense can God be said to care for individuals? The argument of Mr Lunts sermon was to urge from considerations of fitness the probable conjecture of a protecting Providence, which is scarcely reconcileable with the existence of evil— To this belief of a special protecting Providence, that of retribution in a future world is indispensable— Mr Lunt’s afternoon text was from Matthew 13.31. “Another parable put he forth unto them saying, The kingdom of Heaven is like to a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his field: 32 which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.” In this chapter it seems as if Jesus felt it necessary to guard against the imputation of revolutionary designs in his ministry— He speaks of the kingdom of Heaven, in eight several parables in complex imagery, which even his hearers did not understand— He likens his doctrines to seeds and plants, with various results, and in one instance explains his meaning— His object in this parable is to admonish his disciples that they must not judge of the results of his husbandry from the smallness of the seed sown by him. It was perhaps necessary to convey these ideas in figurative language, to disarm the jealously both of the Jewish and of the Roman Institutions which were to be subverted and demolished by the kingdom of Heaven— But I can pursue these subjects no further. I finished reading the article in the Edinburgh Review upon Ignatius Loyola and his Associates, a bloated caricature portraiture of the men, but giving no idea of the Institution. "

I have given him my testimony— The abolitionist charges against him are unjust—but zeal in support of the right of petition can do nothing in the Congress of the United States— I wrote this answer with great difficulty, much hesitation, and not a little imprudence in lifting up one corner of the curtain which covers the hideous reality of the Slave ascendancy in the Government of this Union— The double representation of the Slave owners in the House of Representatives and in the electoral colleges for the choice of President and Vice-President.— Semper ego auditor tantum?

The spell of idleness is yet upon me, and I have no hope of emerging from it— To answer Mr Fessenden’s Letter, I wanted the Journal of the U.S. House of Representatives for the second Session of the 27th. Congress; which was in the chest, which was sent round by water from Washington, and has at last arrived— I opened the chest to find the book, and with it found an enormous budget of Documents and pamphlets to be filed, assorted and bound—which took me not less than three hours to put into complete disorder— I went to the Bank and made a deposite there, but could not reach it before the Noon day bell had rung, when the morning business of the Bank is closed and the doors are shut— But the Cashier Bartlett’s Son came and received my deposit and balanced my book. The grass in my front yard and seminary was mowed— Elizabeth C. Adams dined with us, and after dinner I rode with her, and Mrs Charles and Arthur over Milton hill and bridge to Dorchester, returning by the upper bridge over the Neponset stream— Nicholas Machiavel, and Ignatius Loyola have fallen into a Mesmeric sleep, but I received this morning a Letter from Asa Walker and two others a Committee of Correspondence for a public meeting of the citizens of Bangor and vicinity, holden on the 27th. of last month, and at which a Resolution was adopted to observe the first of next August as the Anniversary of West India emancipation, by a public address and other suitable exercises—and the committee appointed to carry the resolution into execution, invite me to deliver the address— The temptation is almost irresistible, but must be resisted— My time is not yet come— How shall I answer this Letter? The same question is of more than daily recurrence. I have for example an invitation dated the 19th. of April from a Committee of the Directors of the Bunker hill monument association, to unite with them in celebrating the completion of that monument, by a civic and military procession, and an Address, by the Hon Daniel Webster— Upon this pageant has been engrafted another to bedaub with glory John Tyler the Slave-breeder, who is coming with all his Court in gaudy trappings of mock-royalty to receive the homage of hungry Sycophants under colour of doing homage to the principles of Bunker hill martyrdom. I answered this invitation, declining to attend, with a struggle between inclination and decorum, to suppress the most imperative motive for my absence, the disdain to be associated with the mouth worship of Liberty from the lips of the Slave-breeder. I succeeded but indifferently in veiling my emotions, and touched upon the martyrdom of Bunker hill only by transparent generalities, which will yet provoke censure. "

Wednesday  Alonzo Taft came this morning and enquired what had been done with a claim for reimbursement of money paid by him for his passage home from Gibraltar in 1825. when he had been discharged by Commodore Rogers from the Squadron commanded by him without provision for his passage to this Country— He reminded me that nearly two years since he had applied to me concerning this claim— That I had advised him to make a written statement of it fortified with his own affidavit, and such other testimony to the facts as he could procure, and send these papers to me, and I would attend to the claim at Washington. He said he had accordingly made the statement in writing and sworn to it— Had obtained the deposition of another man, and sent all the papers to me here at Quincy, since which he had not heard from me concerning his claim.— The whole subject had totally vanished from my Memory—and after a search of at least four hours I found only the entry in my diary of 7. October 1841. confirming the fact that he did apply to me on that day, and that I gave him the advice precisely as now represented by him— But neither in my diary, nor in my voluminous files of papers can I find a trace of the papers which he says he sent to me, or that I ever received them— I believe I never did— This incident admonishes me that my minutes for remembrance of all the claims to which my attention is due have been sadly deficient in system— Is it too late to improve it?— I received an invitation from Joseph T. Buckingham and 8 others Committee of Arrangements for the Directors of the Bunker hill monument association, to dine at Faneuil Hall on the 17th. and a Card of invitation from the city Council—to a dinner at the Tremont House to be given to the President of the United States on the 15th Friday both of which invitations I declined— I rode to Mount Wollaston this afternoon with Mrs Charles and her three younger sons Charles, Henry and Arthur— From the beach below the mount there is a full view of the Bunker hill column from top to bottom— The Revd. Charles Spear, an itinerant Universalist Minister came and sold me for a dollar, as a gift of friendship a duodecimo volume, of his composition on the names and titles of the Lord Jesus Christ—the fourteenth edition— He spoke of his poverty—of his self education of his pulmonary complaints which interdicted him from preaching; and intending a voyage to England where one edition of his work has been printed, he inquired with some solicitude whether it was held in Europe discreditable to an author to sell his own works— He said he was now preparing a great work on capital punishment— Miss Sampson is here working at her profession.

Freeman came and detained me at home. He informed me that he is to be tried by a Court martial in about 3 weeks at Middletown in the State of Connecticut; upon a charge of scandalous conduct unbecoming an Officer and a gentleman; and the specification is for treating contemptuously his superior by a paragraph, in a Letter to the Secretary of the Navy— He read to me the Letter containing the obnoxious passage, and the Letter from the Secretary of the Navy informing him that he had determined to bring him to trial: and the Coll. asked me if I would assist him as his Counsel— I answered that I earnestly desired to do any thing in my power to befriend him— But that I had never practiced as an advocate before Courts Martial— Had long since ceased to practice in the Courts of civil jurisdiction, and apprehended I was not competent to do justice to his cause as his advocate— Besides which there might be doubts of the propriety of my appearing in that capacity— He did not press his request, but said he should want my testimony— I said I would cheerfully give that if it should be necessary for him, either by a deposition before the judge of the United States judge of the District Court at Boston or by attending in person before the Court martial at Middletown— He intimated his intention to apply to Mr Choate the Senator from this State in Congress to be his Counsel; and I thought he could not do better. Mr Armstrong came to invite me to go to his house on Saturday after the return procession from Bunker’s hill, and before that from the State house to the dinner at Faneuil Hall— I thanked him for his kindness, but I told him I did not propose to be present at any part of the celebrations of that day. The political device of turning the Bunker-hill monument address into a sycophantic tribute of homage to John Tyler is Webster’s, and Boston is of all the Cities in the world the spot to play it off to the greatest advantage— I saw the sun rise and set from Charles’s house.

This was the day of the great celebration of the completion of the monument on Bunker hill; and never since the existence of the three hills was there such a concourse of strangers upon their sides as has been assembled on the banks of “Majestic Charles” this day— What a name in the annals of mankind is Bunker hill?— What a day, was the 17th. of June 1775? and what a burlesque upon them both is an oration upon them by Daniel Webster, and a pilgrimage of John Tyler and his Cabinet of Slave-drivers, to desecrate the solemnity by their presence! And then a dinner at Faneuil Hall in honour of a President of the United States hated and despised by those who invited him to it, themselves as cordially hated and despised by him. I have throughout my life had an utter aversion to all pageants, and public dinners, and never attended one, when I could decently avoid it— I was a student at Cambridge when on the 17th. of June 1786. Charles river bridge was opened— The colleges were emptied on that day of the Students who flocked to witness the procession and the pageant— I passed the day in the solitude of my Study, and dined almost alone in the Hall. I had then no special motive for my absence— But now with the ideal association of the thundering cannon which I heard and the smoke of burning Charlestown which I saw on that awful day, combined with this Pyramid of Quincy granite, and Daniel Webster spouting with a negro holding an umbrella over his head, and John Tyler’s nose with a shadow outstreching that of the monumental column; how could I have witnessed all this at once without an unbecoming burst of indignation or of laughter? Daniel Webster is a heartless traitor to the cause of human freedom. John Tyler is a Slave-monger—what have these to do with the Quincy granite pyramid on the brow of Bunker’s hill?— What have these to do, with a dinner in Faneuil hall, but to swill like swine and grunt about the rights of man?— I stayed at home and visited my seedling trees; and heard the cannonades of the rising, the meridian and the setting Sun—and answered a Letter from the Revd. Joseph Emerson dated at New-London Connecticut making enquiries about a translation of Voltaire’s philosophical dictionary, published under the name of John Quincy Adams, and secretly circulating as he says, about the country, as my work— I saw the Sun set from the front of Charles’s house, at the extremity of his northwestern declination, and as I heard the cannonade salute of the closing day, and saw the smoke ascending from the side of the pyramid, the top of which was full in view; then came in forcible impulse to my memory the cannonade, and the smoke and the fire of the 17th. of June 1775— I waited to see the revolving fire of the Boston Light house kindled, and then returned to my peaceful home "

Romans 7:24. “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” and Philippians 4.13. “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” The doctrine of the discourse was that the will of a perfect Christian fortified by conscience is omnipotent. That nothing is impossible for it to atchieve; and to elucidate the principle, he presented a parallel between these two passages from the writings of St Paul first in the epistle to the Romans in the agonies of despair and then four years later to the Philippians in the exultation of a glorious victory and triumph by the strength of Christ assisting him— The first written in the midst of the terrible struggle of his conversion, and while he was yet uncertain of its success. The last was written after his conversion was consummated, and his confidence in himself with the strength imparted to him by Christ his lord and master was unbounded. Upon this theme Mr Kent amplified and dilated until he reminded me of the story which I once heard Dr Franklin tell of a convent of monks who had a very inconvenient hill in front of their monastery, and upon their faith like a grain of mustard seeds being sufficient cast the mountain into the sea, set up a general onset of prayer to remove the mountain, which they perseveringly pursued till tired of the obstinate adherence of the mountain to its place one of the friars gave out that there was a mistake in the translation of the text, and that the true reading should be that with faith like a mountain it is possible to move a mustard seed— Mr Kent and Mr Lunt dined with us— They were both at the Bunker-hill celebration yesterday; which went off admirably well. Webster’s Oration was brilliant and eminently successful. Two hours and seven minutes— Suitable to the occasion, and often rapturously cheered— The dinner at Faneuil hall was also very well ordered and passed off agreeably.— The cheering of Webster was hearty and general—that of the President feeble and cold— Mr Kents text this afternoon was from Proverbs 16.32. “He that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city.” The Sermon was supplementary to that of the morning, upon the extreme importance and excellence of the faculty of self-controul Mr Lunt gave notice that the Revd. John Gregory would deliver at 5 O’Clock this afternoon a Temperance Lecture and Mr B. O. Tyler would exhibit his design for a family temperance pledge— Some incident already forgotten turned my attention lately to an enquiry into the scriptural notices of Angels, and I looked into Basnage’s history of the Jews—Book 4. chapters 9 and 10. where I found more than I looked for, and more than was very agreeable.

Sun rose 4.22 clear— Set 7.39—  Visitors must account for the idleness of this day— I rose with a dull head ache; and the exercise of the morning consisted in sawing and whittling sticks for stakes. Two brothers named Adams, William van Bergen and Herman C. inhabitants of Coxakie and of Athens in the County of Green, and State of New-York on Hudson river, came and introduced themselves to me— They came from home to attend the Bunker hill celebration, and took the occasion to visit me, and to make some enquiries concerning their own lineage— Their grandfather Joshua Adams removed about eighty years ago, from Turkey Hill, in Hingham, to Egremont, whence their father some years after emigrated to the place where they now reside— There he settled as a practising physician, raised a family of children and died— They wished to know whether Joshua was a descendant from the Patriarch Henry, but I rather thought he was not— The passed an hour with me in conversation chiefly about the family, and after, they went away— Herman C. returned, and said he had a son, to whom he had given my name, about 7 years old, and he requested me to write a few lines of advice that he might keep as an autograph; and I promised that I would— Mr Stow is recorder of the City of Buffalo, in the State of New York He brought me recommendatory Letters from Millard Fillmore and from Genl. Peter B. Porter—the latter very kindly urging me to pay them a visit in that neighbourhood: to which Mr Stow added his own very friendly solicitations— I do not deceive myself by mistaking this earnest desire to hear me for any thing more than mere curiosity—but it is friendly, and claims my gratitude— I believe there is not a man in the world more unfit for self-exhibition at public meetings and banquet dinners— When I go to them it is with feelings of a culprit to punishment than of a victor to triumph— I told Mr Stow that I could not indulge the hope of ever meeting in public the people of buffalo, but should be ever grateful for their kindness and would pray for their prosperity. Mr William Cost Johnson paid me also a visit, with a Mr Chapman—a stranger. Mr Johnson came to witness the Bunker hill monument celebration, and leaves Boston to morrow Morning, returning to Washington— Miss Anna Henshaw with her brother Samuel came this afternoon, on a visit to Mrs Charles, and Mr Tyler to shew me the portrait of my great-grandfather John Quincy at two years of age, painted in 1691 and now refreshed with a coat of his varnish— I rode in the Carriage with Mrs Charles to Mount Woolaston, stopping at Mrs T. B. Adams’s to leave a Letter to her from her son Isaac Hull. "

Another day absorbed by visitors— Charles went to Boston with his daughter, and returned to dine.— He brought the account of the decease this morning between 5 and 6. O’Clock of Hugh S. Legaré of South Carolina, Attorney General of the United States, and acting Secretary of State— He died at the house of his friend Mr George Ticknor, to which he had been removed the day before from his lodgings at the Tremont house— He had been invited as a member of the Presidents cabinet to the monumental celebration— The duties of his two departments prevented him from accompanying the President on his journey; but he left Washington so as to reach the Tremont house on Friday and was present at the dinner given to the President by the City Council at that house on that day— He was then much indisposed and the next day so ill, that he was unable to attend the celebration at the hill. His disease which was bilious colic continued increasing in violence, and inaccessible to all medical treatment till he expired. He was an able, and a very amiable man—by far the best of the Presidents present associates— Just as I was called to dinner, came in Doctor Goodale, a stranger from the Western part of the State of New York— He introduced himself, and asked numerous questions of whig politics, and particularly concerning the prospects of John Tyler at the next Presidential Election— There is no doubt he believes this idle pageant and personal courtesy will draw upon him over powering popularity— The experiment has in part succeeded, and its total failure is certainly not yet demonstrated. He visited Lowell yesterday, with a numerous train and was received with tolerable cordiality— Mr Alexander Marsh came to make enquiries about the family of that name— His father named Esek Marsh went from this town some seventy years ago, and took with him this person then a boy who seems to have had no communication with this town or with his relatives left here— I referred him to the two brothers residing between this and the Stone temple; but he appeared not satisfied with that, and inquired if I knew any thing of a family here by the name of Hamilton— Mr Edward A Newton of Pittsfield, and Mrs Newton paid us an afternoon visit. She is a daughter of my old friend the late Dudley Atkins Tyng, but I had never seen her before— There very urgent in the invitation of me to the agricultural anniversary at Pittsfield next October— Ride after they were gone with Mrs Charles and the baby to Milton.

Set 7:40.— Day 15 h. 17 m  I saw the Sun rise and set—still at the solstice; clear the whole day, and the first unequivocal summer day we have had this Season. As I have given up almost entirely the exercise of walking, and believing as I do that strenuous exercise of the body is yet a necessary of life to me, I am devoting two hours of the morning, immediately after sunrise to labour for my seedling trees. I am ashamed that after fifteen years search for the secret of raising trees from the seed, I am as ignorant of it as before I began— I now despair of producing any useful result from my labours in this respect. But I have many trees at different stages of their growth, which I may cherish into useful trees. My most successful experiments have been in manuring the ground where the seeds are planted; and I am about to resume that occupation with another, sawing and cutting twigs for stakes. This is hard work and squeezes perspiration out of the skin, as from the peel of an Orange— It is wasted time but necessary exercise— Elizabeth C. Adams was here after breakfast, and then Deacon Spear, who proposed to me to visit my woodlots, adjoining to which Daniel Baxter has purchased a lot which did belong to the late Ebenezer Adams— I referred Deacon Spear to my Son to fix a day when we should all go and make this survey, and discuss vicinage with Mr Baxter— After dinner I was visited by the Revd Benjamin Kent, and his brother in Law, Mr Bradford who has resided some years in China, whence he returned about two years since— Mr Kent had mentioned to me, sundry relics from the combustion of Miles Standish’s house in Duxbury—an old rusty hinge and door latch—a piece of the floor burnt to charcoal a small fragment from what he thought a pane of painted glass— All which he dug out from the ruins of the house, for which he dug more than a century after it was burnt and found fifteen feet under the surface. He had also a small viol full of char’d wheat seeds of which he found a bushel at the same search— He gave me these relics, and left with me to examine it, a large volume with antient manuscript deeds and Letters, and three or four volumes of manuscript Sermons among which one volume containing several Sermons as early as 1680 by my great grandmother Quincy’s father John Norton Minister at Hingham— Mr Legare’s funeral took place at 10 this morning at Trinity Church; under which his body is deposited—and at 4 O’Clock this afternoon Mr John Tyler self Styled President of the United States with his Cabinet took the Cars of the Norwich Rail-road on their return to Washington— "

Two hours of the morning wasted in idle labour to keep alive the scanty remnant of my seedling trees— Nine tenths of the seeds that I have sown, have failed to come up, or perished— Of the remaining tenth—two thirds have been taken up and transplanted to my Sons grounds, or to those of Mr Robinson the Episcopal Minister— My record which I have kept from year to year of almost all my plantations, has fallen into inextricable confusion, from its very minuteness— Four fifths of the cherished seeds which came up and flourished for a time have withered and been extirpated so long that I have lost even the memory; while the Nursery gardens and Seminary, are now overstocked with seedlings which choak one another. I have trees now. Oaks, Apples, Shagbarks, pignuts, Ash, Maple and Cherry which will outlive centuries, unless cut down, uprooted or blasted by lightnings I take pleasure in watching their growth, and in the thought of leaving them to grow till my grand children shall remember me in finding shelter and shade under them. But I have never been able to impart my marotte to any one of them. If I could I have no doubt that my successor would have improved the art of planting and the Science of dendrology— Among the rest he would have discovered the folly of wasting time upon the cultivation of trees not suited to the climate—Apricots, Nectarines, Cork, Willow and live Oaks: and he would have found the art of cultivating pears, plums, and cherries in perfection which I have sought in vain— My Philadelphia Seminary maple, seed sown 1. June 1835 measures now 19 inches round the trunk, and is about 25 feet high— Shoots are putting out from the stems of seedling English Oaks of the third year, crop’d by the Scythe of the Mower in the Seminary, on the 13th. Mr Francis Tookey is a student at the Law School in Cambridge having been there one year and nine months, and has three months more to finish his term— He says he visited me, once before in 1838. of which I had no recollection— He asked me for an autograph, and I gave him my sign manual, on a small card engraving of Durand’s portrait— Mr Enoch Hunt was here towards evening when I was reading on the Settee in front of the house— He said he thought I should not be able to bear the fatigues of the next Session of Congress.

Set 7.40 beclouded—  The declination of the Sun Southward is already perceptible since Tuesday last both morning and evening, though not marked in the American Almanac. I took off a limb from the black willow South of the bridge over the brook in the lane between my house and Charles’s and slip’d from it several twigs which I stuck down as stakes, to ascertain whether any of them will take root. This experiment I have heretofore made with full success both with willows, and button woods.— But the button woods and red Cedars are now perishing all over the Country no one knows why or from what cause— I had a new hinge put on to a tool shed in the garden, which was there in my fathers time, and kept the tools— The lower hinge of the shed door was broken I believe when I came into possession—the door could not be closed and a spade and two hoes have disappeared— It is close to a spot which I have found favourable for raising delicate seedlings the first and second years till they are fit for transplantation. I began the manuring of my plats. My Seminary teems with apple seedlings from two six feet high, pushing up their plumelets with unusual rapidity, but meeting with two enemies: the aphis, and a green maggot worm which arrest their growth. There are three black walnuts in the seminary, one in the garden, and one in the Nursery, growing all with the same rank luxuriance but for which I dread the trial of the winter— The two Pennsylvania shagbarks in the Garden have to undergo the same ordeal— The budded cherry leaves are covered with rusty spots, and every cherry has an ugly speck upon it. The wild cherry’s swarm this year— Mr Curtis came this morning, with a plan of the house in School Street, of the Estate of Ward N. Boylston, and the adjoining Tremont Theatre lot with the boundary title deeds— He inclined to cede to the purchasers of the Tremont Theatre a strip ten feet wide, across the Eastern end of the lot, as an equivalent for their surrender of a five feet passage way and the use of a pump and well.— I approved and promised my assent to this arrangement— Charles went to Boston with his daughter and returned to dine— He brought me the manuscript copy of my Discourse on the New England confederacy which Harriet Welsh had undertaken but some one else has completed— Fahrenheit till noon this day was at 84 in my chamber— Then came a cooling eastern breeze and in two hours the thermometer was down to 72. The evening was rather more than cool. Mrs Henshaw and her son Samuel came out and took tea here. After which I rode with Mrs Charles to the Saltwork beach behind President Quincy’s deserted house. Elizabeth C. Adams was here this Evening. I revised in part the copy of my discourse. "

Last of the Solstice  After an abridged excursion to see the rising Sun, and to visit and study my seedling plants and listen to the matinal minstrelsy of the bobalink, the spring-bird and the robin, with the chirping of the sparrow, and the new whistle of the quail, I think all the aerial music of this time and place, I returned to my library chamber, and revised the copy of my Discourse on the New-England confederacy of 1643, furnished me by Harriett Welsh, and which I made up and despatched by the mail to James Savage, President of the Massachusetts Historical Society, at Boston— In revising this Discourse I had the opportunity of examining it with cooler judgment than I had while composing it.— I was then somewhat disqualified by the hurry, agitation, and severe disposition under which I was labouring: with a keen apprehension, that my Catarrh would disable me from delivering it, and extreme anxiety that it would if delivered be tedious and dull to the auditory— It was on the contrary happily delivered, and with as much favour from the auditory as I could have expected or ought to have desired— It is now a historical document, and a political disquisition; to be published by the Massachusetts Historical Society, and will pass to posterity as one of my contributions to the labours of that Institution.— I would it were wiser—more philosophical—more profound— I would the faculty had been conferred upon me to enlighten my brethren of the human race; to improve their condition upon earth—to rule them by the energies of the Soul— Perhaps one of the sins for which I may have to answer hereafter to answer is that of repining at the scantiness of the portion of intellect which I was endowed— The day differed from that of yesterday. A morning less intensely warm, but no east wind at noon to chill the atmosphere— I received a new packet of proposals for repairing the mill dam of the Columbian Mills, with a Letter from Mr Frye, which I immediately answered— I received also, nearly a fortnight since an invitation from Bangor an invitation to deliver an anniversary address there on the 1st. of August the day in 1838 of the total emancipation of the Slaves, in the British colonies of the West Indies— After much hesitation and deliberation I began this day an answer to this invitation: and I was occupied almost the whole afternoon in a fruitless search for the bond of indemnity to Petty Vaughan, which he requires that the Executors of Ward N. Boylston to execute before he will remit the monies held by him and belonging to the Estate. Mrs Charles rode without me to Weymouth— After Sunset there was a threat of a thunder gust and shower, which evaporated in wind, and a mere sprinkling of rain. The Atlas of this day says that Websters regret at my absence on the 17th. was not spoken. "

                "text": "25. IV. Sunday.  Sun rose 4.24— Set 7:40  Mr Lunt and his wife are gone upon an excursion into the State of New-York. The Revd. Dr Kendall of Plymouth preached here for him—in the morning from John 1.18. [“]No Man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the father, he hath declared him.” It was one of the sacred doctrines of the Jews that no man ever saw God or could see him and live— His voice was often heard, and his angels were often seen— He was made perceptible by fire, as to Moses in the burning bush; and to Elijah when carried up in a chariot of fire— Moses had the hardihood to ask to see him, and he passed before him so as to shew his hinder parts—but it was only a storm of wind— By the incarnation God was made manifest in the flesh; and here the Messiah, said to be in the bosom of the father, it is further said had declared him— Dr Kendall’s argument was that the gospel of Christ was the manifestation of God. I invited Dr Kendall to dine with us; but he asked to be excused He said he was turned of seventy and never dined between the services and that what he most needed was repose— But that he would cheerfully walk home with me after the second service—in which of course I acquiesced. After dinner, the text was from Hebrews 11.5. “By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death: and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.” The story and character of Enoch are among the most mysterious parts of the Bible— Scarcely any thing is said of him in the old Testament, except that which is noted in this passage of the Epistle to the Hebrews— That he walked with God, and was not because God took him; Why he was so privileged we are not told—nor how he was thus removed from Earth, exempted from the common law of human nature to die. St. Paul says it was by Faith; and because he pleased God. I scarcely can tell by what process it was, that Dr Kendall made this text the theme for giving a brief historical statement of the ministers of the gospel who were settled in the old Plymouth Colony before the commencement of the present century—of whom only two or three still survive. He is himself the only one still in office as Pastor of a Church, and he has now a colleague settled with him— He paid a tribute of friendship and of honour to the memory of the late Senior pastor of the Quincy church, who died very suddenly on theoflast, and he spoke reverently of Dr Henry Ware whose Ordination as Minister of the first Church at Hingham I attended in September 1787. and who is yet living, emeritus professor of divinity at Harvard University. Dr Kendall came home with me after the second Service—and after walking up the hill to see the Sunset from the front of Charles’s house, parted from us in peace. "

Set 7.40  I continue my morning exercise, and observe the mysteries of vegetation upon my seedling trees— Among them is the difference between the plants whose growth is continuous through the summer—those which have but one term of growth of a few weeks in the Spring; and those which have two— This difference is remarkable in the Oaks— The black having but one; and the red two six weeks growths in a summer— On the 13th. instt Dennis mowed the grass in the seminary, and cropped the stem of a third year seedling of an English white Oak in Mary-Louisa’s patch—a lateral shoot has put out from the mutilated stem and is now in the process of opening leaves— The same thing is happening to a second year seedling in the garden, which I accidentally cropped about the same time.— But the English white Oak seedlings of this Season have ceased to grow and the most thrifty of them is not more than 4 inches high. The Philadelphia maple continues to grow the whole summer One in the Seminary and one in the Garden from the seeds sown by me 1. June 1835 are 17 inches in circumference and 20 feet high— About noon I met Mr E. Price Greenleaf in the Garden and he inspected with me all my trees— He cautioned me against trimming the trees after the 22d. of June; and he brought to my notice the depredations upon all my trees of insects and worms almost numberless— The thriftiest of my apple trees, in its tenth year and already bearing has half a dozen Gimlet holes just above the ground pierced by the borer— Another 14 years old and bearing freely has a worm in every apple. The Caterpillar and the Canker are angels commissioned for destruction. The beetle or dorbug nips the shoot in its prime, and invisible thieves in the darkness of the night strip the Oaks of their tender leaves, and yield them up to withering decay— The drought, the flood, the frost, the Sun, the gale, the blight, the field mouse at the root and the green louse or aphis at the germ, form such a host of foes, that it is as hard to raise a tree as a child— Charles and his wife went this afternoon to Hingham in search of a School for their two eldest boys— I continued without finishing my answer to the invitation from Bangor to deliver there an Oration on the first of August in celebration of the emancipation of Slaves in the British West Indies— This answer will be instead of the oration itself; but it is already too long and must be much longer to be worthy of the theme. I shall probably not send it after all, but I feel an irremissible duty to bear my testimony once more, before I go hence against Slavery. To select the time, the place and the manner is a subject of great consideration and must be neither precipitated nor too long delayed— My ideas are yet crude indigested and confused. I will begin to collect and assort them in this Letter, with the firm resolve to persevere in the pursuit. I began also this afternoon to read Dr Henry Wares Inquiry into the foundation Evidences and Truth’s of Religion—of which he sent me last year a copy, the receipt of which I have not yet acknowledged.

My Marotte gives me abundant exercise for two hours of the morning, and my only apprehension now is of its encroaching on my hours of labour. I received this morning a Letter from my wife dated last Friday in which she informs me that her brother is better, and she proposes to leave Washington to morrow and expects to arrive here next Saturday. Charles and his wife had already concluded to go up the hill to their own house to morrow— Charles went to Boston with his daughter this morning and returned to dine. His wife took her two eldest boys this morning to Hingham, and left them at a boarding school kept by Mr and Mrs Wilder— Mrs Wilder is a daughter of Nehemiah Parsons, whose wife was the only daughter of the old and faithful friend of my childhood and youth John Thaxter— I walked this morning with my Sons third son, Henry Brooks, to his school Mrs.Their youngest boy Arthur, an uncommonly beautiful and forward child was born 23 July 1841— A Mr Mill, originally from New-Hampshire, now attached to a college or high school at Crawfordsville Indiana came in near our dinnertime, having walked this morning from Abington— Charles White, the President of the College, he says is a lineal descendent from Perigrine White, the first born of New-England— Mr Mill said their buildings had been burnt down, and he was travelling to solicit contributions for re building them— I invited him to dine with us; but he was afraid of losing the afternoon stage to Boston, and declined— He made several enquiries to know if the college could obtain a collection of the distributable public documents to supply the place of those which were consumed in the fire— He was also desirous of procuring a complete collection of the publications of the Massachusetts Historical Society— And he spoke of the Representatives from Indiana in the last Congress, and particularly of Mr Lane, who was no favourite politician to him— Elizabeth C. Adams was here this afternoon. So intense was the heat that my afternoon was lost in idleness— I resorted two or three times to my hard bed, but could neither sleep nor repose— I read two Chapters of Dr Ware’s Inquiry into the foundation, Evidences and Truths of Religion; but I could neither understand nor take interest in what I read. I was obliged to lay the book aside, and had no spirit or impulse to take up any other. I was not able to get through one page of my Letter to Bangor— As Sunset approached we all went up and saw it from the front of Charles’s house in cloudless splendor descend beneath the horizon— There was a refreshing breeze and we sat under the portico, till the town curfew bell of 9. sounded our retreat— In my concert of birds the other morning I forgot to mention the black-bird, blue-bird, and swallow, all of which join in the chorus.

My morning exercise becomes tedious unless I fix my attention upon particular plants of which I have now a considerable number in the critical state of uncertainty between life and death— The summer house Apple tree, the growth of which has been so cheeringly rapid, is doomed to death by the borer worm— The tree in front of my study window, under the brow eastward of the old horse chesnut; after suffering from the Scythe in 1834. and the field mouse three or four years later has now a stock in circumference about the size of my thumb and six feet high; and if duly guarded from its foes will form a valuable tree— Upon almost every patch into which I gradually year by year since 1834 divided the seminary I have now growing young seedlings of different kinds together with others transplanted all with the intention of finishing by raising one tree on each patch.— On many of them I have peach trees some of which have borne, and others but last summer were of the fairest promise. They are now little better than totally destroyed— I shall be compelled to uproot them all.— I have very few pears, and not one of thrifty growth—few and very unpromising cherries— Three black walnuts, transplanted in 1840 from the garden, and now for the first time seeming likely to live— One solitary shagbark walnut first hopeful this year—perhaps 20 English white oaklings whose fate is dubious— One beautiful Apple tree now six feet high and a strait stem alongside of a stunted, transplanted but yet finely growing Philadelphia maple. The multitude of these trees furnishes me occupation for two hours every morning merely to look at them— The result of all my labours for the cultivation of trees from the seed will probably be lost; but if I could inoculate my son or one of my grandson with my own fancy for seedling trees he would raise the most magnificent forest and the most delicious orchard that ever was known in New England— Charles and his family removed this day, up the hill to his house, and Louisa C. Smith, came out from Boston by Gillet’s stage, to keep house for me till the arrival of my wife from Washington— This day was intensely hot; so that although I finished the record of yesterday before Noon I could accomplish nothing further for the remainder of the day. I attempted in vain to finish my Letter to Bangor, and was equally unsuccessful in attempting to make progress in reading Dr Henry Wares Inquiry. I find it however work of profound interest, and have determined if it please the great disposer to read it in the spirit of the Inquiry itself— As a subject which it is one of the great duties of my life to examine and to penetrate to the utmost extent of the capacity which God has given me "

My Morning exercise encroaches too much on my hours of labour; and rising as I do at half past 3 in the morning I am called to breakfast almost before I have seated myself at the table for daily writing— This morning I discovered three more cropped apple-seedlings, in the range between the Althaea and the old horse chesnut tree— One of the crops is a mere steminches high without the trace of a bud or leaf upon it— I shall try the experiment if they can be revived, and hoed up partially the grass around them, watered the ground about their roots and gave them some refreshment of manure.— The cropd oakling in Mary Louisa’s patch has put out a new stem and fair leaves, but the tender fresh leaves of that in the garden next the kitchen, as well as those of the shagbark, have had the borders of their leaves scorched to a black cinder by one day’s heat of the Sun. Charles went to Boston and returned home to dine. The morning set in at high summer heat, and I expected a roasting day, but by 10 O’Clock there came a soft eastern breeze, which without obscuring the Sun cooled the atmosphere to a delicious temperature, and left me full power to read or write without interruption— Yet I read only a few pages of Dr Ware’s Inquiry into the foundation, evidences and truths of Religion— He begins with the foundation of religion—that is he begins by stating the temper of mind in which the inquiry should be pursued— The first section of the introduction is an argument to prove that religion is an interesting subject of inquiry.— The second that there is no reason for entering on the inquiry with a wish to find its claims without foundation in truth— These are preliminaries— Now that religion is an interesting inquiry, no one will deny who is capable of making and pursuing the inquiry at all. The desire of continued existence is planted in the nature of man— The brute creation cling to life as tenaciously as man—more tenaciously—for they never commit voluntary suicide—but they have no conception of what death is or of a state of existence after death— Man learns by experience as a witness and by tradition what death is—he sees that it is the extinction of his being— He has hopes and desires but no evidence of continued existence after death— Dr Ware’s first chapter therefore is with what evidence the inquirer ought to be satisfied on the subject.— That is—what he is to take for evidence, which is not evidence. All the Evidence is negative, and the only alternative for the inquirer is to abandon the enquiry and take his fate as it comes, or to put up with Faith as the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.— The creation speaks for itself and discloses a creator or creators, one or more—no evidence to decide that question, but faith acknowledges only one God— I wrote two pages of my Letter to Bangor, and as Sunset approached I walked up the hill, and spent the evening under Charles’s portico, and in his Study. He told me Caleb Cushing proposed to visit me to-morrow. "

In ranging round my grounds every morning, not a day passes, but I meet with some new phenomenon of vegetation, the observation of which ought to be accompanied and immediately followed by examination and meditation— It never is, and however mortifying to my self-conceit it may be, I am constrained to confess that the faculty of combining ideas and brooding over them till they fructify, hasn if not totally denied to me, imparted in scanty measure.— I took John Kirk round my seedling nurseries this morning and shewed him the trees that are, and those that are not to be taken up— I have now from the acorn, the black, white, red, and chesnut Oaks of considerable size, besides the English white Oaks which bear acorns in profusion. None of the native trees have yet borne fruit— Our red cherries are now so far ripened that we had yesterday and this day tarts made of them— The trees throw up suckers which bear transplanting and are of rapid growth, but I have never raised a cherry, except the mazzard, or a plum from the stone— This day there was a very light easterly breeze which made the day comfortable. I wrote further upon my Letter to Bangor, but did not finish it— Read a chapter in Dr Ware’s inquiry. His second chapter is on the sources from which the proofs of Religion and its truths are to be drawn.— These are Nature, and Revelation.— “The being of God, including all his attributes—the moral government of God, and a future life of righteous retribution”— To these articles may be reduced, and in them included—[“]all that we know of religion by the light of Nature.”— Creation is indeed to the mind of man evidence of a creator—but is it evidence of his moral government— This is not clear— Still less is it evidence of future righteous retribution— The visible creation evinces order—but not moral government, or future retribution— In the progress of human reason man conceives the idea of justice; and the family relations teach sympathy— With the idea of God therefore is connected in one indissoluble chain those of power, justice and mercy; and from them are deduced those of moral government and future retribution— Still the continued existence of man after death is so contrary to all the evidence of the senses, that it must rest forever on the pillars of Faith— I have too long intermitted the monthly summary of my daily occupations— In the month of June just expired I have risen at an earlier average than 4— Go up the hill to see the Sunrise from the South-east corner of my son’s house with one of the most magnificent spectacles of nature in the scenery before me— I then loiter about my grounds two hours or more. Return to my chamber and receive the mail except on Sundays. Breakfast at 8. Read newspapers and Letters, and write till 1/2 past 2. dine—Siesta—ride with my daughter in the carriage—up the hill to see the Sunset— No Evening "

Mr Lunt who has been with his wife upon a fortnights excursion into the Country returned home yesterday, and preached this morning from Ephesians 6 13 “Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.” The discourse was a very earnest exhortation, to resist all manner of temptation— It was a very serious and sensible dissertation upon a duty which every Christian is called very frequently called to perform— The Lord’s prayer supplicates the almighty not to lead us into temptation; which implies that temptation itself comes from the agency of God himself, and seems to imply that from the weakness and frailty of our Nature we are not able to resist a temptation when it comes.— The Scripture says that the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and in another place that the Lord gave the children of Israel Statutes that were not good. But if the Lord leads men into temptation, who can redeem them from it?— This is one of the mysteries for future solution— It cannot be accounted for here— Mr Degrand came out from Boston, and dined and spent the day with me. Mr Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from Psalm 101.1. [“]I will sing of mercy and judgment; unto thee, O Lord will I sing.”— The Sermon was a sort of critical and historical Essay upon the book of Psalms— A subject upon which there is much to be said— I would consider it first as the only model of Hebrew Lyric Poetry. 2. compare it with the Lyric Poetry of the Greeks and Romans. 3. It exclusive character devotional— 4. connected with the religious worship of the tabernacle and afterwards of the temple— The musical establishment of David connected with the composition of the Psalms. 5. The effect of music, vocal and instrumental, upon religious worship. 6. Peculiarly suited to the worship of one God— Creator and Preserver of the world— The adaptation of sacred music and Psalms, to Christian worship.— Mr Lunt gave out to be sung after the Sermon his 57th hymn, which is Watts’s version of the 33d. psalm—one of the poorest that Watts ever composed—in which he makes ways rhyme with grace, loves with proves, spread with made, and seas with place; all in three Stanzas— It ought not to have been admitted into his collection— There was a collection taken up according to the annual usage for the Sunday school library. The S.S. Westerly gale, burning hot blew till the going down of the Sun, and then came on a very light thunder shower Mr Degrand left us to return to Boston shortly before nine— I attempted a versification of the 33d Psalm but only accomplished it in part— The Great Western Steamer arrived yesterday at New-York from Liverpool, and brought News from London to the 17th. of June.

The Sun rose beclouded, and the weather was nearly as warm, as last evening immediately after the shower which was very light— I visited my seedling trees and wasted two hours in digging round them, manuring the land; and coaxing the small ones to grow— In the meantime a fresh breeze from the Northwest swept off all the clouds and compelled me to resume my winter garments. Mr Caleb Cushing Commissioner Plenipotentiary to China, and Joseph Vance heretofore a member of Congress from the State of Ohio, and afterwards Governor of that State paid me a morning visit, before breakfast; and subsequently the Revd. Samuel K. Lothrop, with Mr Ezekiel Bacon of Utica New-York— Cushing’s visit would have surprized me, but that he had told my Son last Friday that he intended to make it— He has not made his Court to Captain Tyler in vain. His obsequiousness and sacrifice of principle lost him the favour of his Constituents who repudiated him at the recent elections, but Mr Tyler had more precious favours in his gift, and he has lavished them in profusion upon Cushing. He is to embark in a few days for Alexandria in Egypt—to proceed thence overland to Bombay; where he is to find the Steamer Missouri, which is to take him to Canton— Mr Vance has within a few years experienced also the fickleness of popular favour— He was originally a poor labourer, but rose by his eloquence to Congress and to the Government of the State, and then was dropped into his primitive obscurity— Corwin is such an other, with more talent but not with deeper root. Ezekiel Bacon can tell much the same tale— He was a member of Congress from Berkshire, Massachusetts at the time of Jefferson’s embargo. Afterwards moved into the State of New-York, and engaged deeply in her politics—but has been many years an invalid; retired altogether from public life, and writing verses in a sick chamber at Utica— My correspondence with him began in 1808. and I have several Letters from him with enclosed poetry within the last year— I had not seen him since I went to Russia, and did not know him even when named to me by Mr Lothrop till the course of conversation disclosed who he was.— Archibald Macon (his Surname I forgot[)] is a black man who says he has been studying Law these two years, and is raising a contribution to enable him to go to Hayti or to Jamaica. I rode to Milton this afternoon with Louisa C. Smith, Mrs Charles and her baby Arthur— I received this morning a Letter from my wife, with information that Johnson Hellen—his wife andchildren have been poisoned with Arsenic steeped in their coffee at breakfast by an Irishwoman— I finished this Evening my Letter to Bangor.

But soon after the sky was swept clear with a Northwest wind rather cold than cool. In my morning visitation to my trees I still found something to observe. I took off a girdle of suckers round an old Russet apple tree in the lane between my house and Charles’s; and I tied to the old dead stem two shoots of a black Jack Oak which has been growing twelve years in the Nursery; which throws up every summer shoots four or five feet high, and die down almost to the ground every winter— I have thus nearly ascertained that the Cork, Willow, and live-Oak, will not bear this climate— I fear the blackjack, will share the same fate; but I hope the English white-Oak may be propagated by the Acorn to any extent. Of a dozen acorns from the nursery trees, which I sowed last October, in a row close to the kitchen garden gate, last Thursday I perceived that one was breaking through the surface of the ground, and now at the end of a week, the plumelet is about half an inch above ground in the form of miniature leaves— This morning I perceived a second and this afternoon a third of the same row piercing through the soil— I sowed about the same time last autumn a number of shagbark walnuts, not one of which yet appears. Probably the reason why so many seedlings from this hard nut are winter-killed the first season after they come up is because they come up so late in the summer that they have not time to harden into wood before the sharp frosts set in—and I propose a double experiment to see if the vegetation of them cannot be hastened or retarded; by sowing from the 15th. to the 20th of October 3 rows of one dozen each 1. of nuts in the shell. 2. of nuts with the shell cracked. 3. of nuts in the drupe.— Another experiment may be to sow one row on the 1st. of October and another on the first of November— I find a multitude of new hatched slug worms eroding the surface of my cherry tree and pear tree leaves— Fresh spurs are putting forth from button-wood trees and stakes which were apparently dead— There came a man apparently 60 years of age, in very coarse apparel with red hair and a weather-beaten face, who said he was a Virginia named Richard Bland Randolph— That he had received in 1798 a midshipman’s warrant from my father; had been one of the captors of the French frigate L’Insurgente; and had been dismissed from the service at the reduction of the Navy by Mr Jefferson in 1802. That he had now a petition before congress for prize money of which he had never lifted the first cent; that he had made himself odious in Virginia by expressing opinions in favour of abolition; and that he had not bread to eat— I rode this afternoon to Milton with Louisa C Smith, Mrs Charles, and her boy Arthur— "

The Columbian Hall at the Lebanon Springs, the house at which we have taken our lodgings, is a Hotel kept by Hull and Bentley, with about 120 bed chambers on four low Stories of a wooden mansion with a wide piazza round three sides of the house on the second and third Stories— A large dining hall on the ground floor with a reading and bar room over which ascending a flight of steps there is also a large drawing room— The house is built on the eastern side of a high and steep hill, in the form of a half rectangle the short side of which fronts the street, and the long side a very extensive valley between two ranges of lofty mountains chiefly covered with Oak, chesnut, beech—birch, black walnut and especially sugar maple trees, interspersed with willows and sycamores of respectable size and stature but none of them very large or tall— The sumach, and locust are also very common among them.— On rising this morning and walking round the piazza, I was much struck by the successive lights and shades of the Sun rising in a crystal clear sky, gilding the tops of the mountains successively in proportion to their respective elevations piercing through interstitial passages between the hills into parts of the valley, and casting long dark shades of solitary trees in one direction before them—for three quarters of an hour the peaks of the mountains were taking one after another the golden tinge, before the sunbeam became visible from the piazzo, on which I was walking, and listening to the morning concert of the birds. This was very little varied by the spring and yellow birds, with the king-bird, wren, swallow and robin— None, but what I hear at Quincy, and no sound either of bobolink or quail.— I wrote till breakfast time at 8 and soon after with all our party, a Mr Aymer and two Ladies from New-York, and Edward, a son of Patrick Jackson I rode in two Carriages up the hills to a tower about 50 feet high on the loftiest summit of this neighbourhood, whence we had a range of prospect round the compass with a radius of fifty miles.— The line between the States of New-York and Massachusetts is on the road from Lebanon to the tower which is in Berkshire County, and whence parts of the States of Massachusetts, New-Hampshire, Vermont and New-York are visible at one view— Returning from the tower, at Noon, I took a bath: Water at 90. not warm. After dinner I had a visit from Mr Dunham and Mr Hayden of Pittsfield to invite me there; but I declined— Mr Dunham brought with him his daughter Helen Maria’s Album for me to write my name in it— We next rode, taking with us a small boy a son of Mrs Crowninshield, to the village of the Shakers, and visited a man named John Mantle, and a woman living in two rooms of one house, where they keep a small shop of Shakerism, at unconscionable prices. we saw also their dairy, and cheeses and cow-yard with two women, milking 25 cows— Returned, and after tea, spent the Evening on the Piazza, in converse with a cluster of Strangers.

                "text": "10. IV.15. Monday.  I had a night not of undisturbed repose, which I attributed to the warm bath of last evening. But the discomforts of it soon passed away.— I went up on the Lookout on the top of the house, and saw the Sunrise above the Eastern hill tops, at 5 minutes past five— He was shining on the tops successively of all the surrounding hills for about half an hour before his first beam met my eye. A person by the name of Spelman came on to the Piazza, and spoke to me from outside of my chamber window— He said he belonged to Albany and happening to be for some days at Pittsfield, he had heard of my passing through that Town and that I was here.— And that never having seen me, and thinking it probable he might never have an opportunity of seeing me again, He took his horse this morning and came over from Pittsfield with the determination to see me, and thake hands with me; and having accomplished that purpose he would detain me no longer, and took his leave— After breakfast, with Mr Brooks, Mr Loring’s two sons, Edward, son of Patrick Jackson, and John Quincy, I rode in a Barouche to the tunnel of the Western rail-road, nine miles distant from Lebanon, through the valley stretching from the Southern end of Columbia Hall. The tunnel is a subterraneous excavation 40 feet wide and 200 feet long through a rock of solid marble, like that of the coal mine in Silesia or that of the catacombs at Paris except that they have no outlet, while this pierces through the rock from side to side forming an arch about 12 feet high with a mass of earth covered with a forest of trees over it— This is the most extraordinary achievement on the western rail-road; and is said to have been projected and effected, by an Englishman and work men in the compass of one year. The road to it is very good, partly through the valley between the two ranges of mountains cultivated on both sides with pasture and meadowlands, Rye, Indian corn, Potatoes, Oats, and very little wheat with scattered groves of Chesnut, black walnut, Sugar Maples—locust, Sycamore, Oaks black and white, hemlock and pine trees— We returned, reaching Columbia Hall just before one. We had expected a Letter from my Son, by the mail this afternoon; but were disappointed; we concluded nevertheless to depart at 7. to morrow morning; return to the Western rail-road, and proceed to Saratoga— The Daily Advertiser of this morning from Boston, brought the account of the Shipwreck last Monday of the Cunard Steamer Columbia, on black ledge, near Seal Island on the coast of Nova Scotia— Also the deaths of Washington Alston at Cambridge, and of John Holmes at Portland.

At Albany, now a city of 33000 inhabitants and Troy, distant from it but 7 miles, with a population of 25000 we met the crowd and bustle of a swarming hive of bees— After a short visit to Mrs. Dickinson; a meeting in the Street with Genl.

                "text": "12. IV.15. Wednesday.  I have got into a great crowd of Strangers; a position always painful to me, and for which from a perpetual want of presence of mind, I am not fitted— After finishing the record of yesterday I walked out—took a tumbler of Congress water, at the spring and found it a very weak chalybeate, and walked along the public grounds to a hillock on the summit of which was a circular railroad wheeled round the movement bein effected by the person riding— Returning to the Hotel I met Mr Fletcher who conducted me to theSpring and Bathing house. Before and after breakfast many of the visitors at the house, strangers were introduced, neither whose names nor persons remain on my memory. Two gentlemen belonging to the village came and said many citizens of the place were desirous of paying their personal respects to me, for which they asked me to fix a time; which I did for 10 to-morrow morning. Mr Huntington proposed to me to go out with him and some other gentlemen to view the battleground between Gates and Burgoyne; and the place where the British army surrendered— Accordingly, eight of us went out in two carriages, among whom were Mr Grinnell, Captain Breese of the Navy, Mr Howard, a member of the Council of Massachusetts, a Mr Russell with two others 12 or 13 Miles, to Bemis’s heights, which our drivers had some difficulty in finding— On the way out we crossed the Saratoga lake in a flat ferry boat, and shortly before reaching the heights, we passed by a very small and mean looking hovel in front of which stood an old man, who the driver told us was a hundred years old— We turned back and enquired whether he had been at the surrender of Burgoyne— He said no—he was at that time stationed in Connecticut; but that he was a Canadian, born at Quebec one hundred years old last month— That on the appearance of the American army before Quebec in 1776 he joined them; was present at the death of Montgomery, and served in the American army through the whole revolutionary War— I perceived that he spoke English with a French accent and spoke to him in French, which he spoke with native familiarity— He said that on the death of Montgomery Carlton cried like a child— He said also that he had been with General Washington in the campaign through the Jersies, and spoke of a victory at Elizabeth town, at which 36 pieces of cannon, with 900 barrels of flour as many of rum, and as many hogsheads of wine had been taken— On the heights we found a gentleman farmer named Neilson, 54 years old, who told us his father had lived in the house where he now lives, and that Genl Poor and another had quartered in his kitchen— He had two maps, upon which he pointed out to us every position occupied by the several detachment both of Gates’s and of Burgoyne’s armies in the two actions of 19. September and of 7. October 1777 1777. We had with us the volume of Marshall’s life of Washington, containing the narrative of both those actions, and compared it with the positions pointed out to us, by Mr Neilson— He walked out with us to the house of a neighbouring farmer named Walker a native of Smithfield, Rhode-Island, but settled here these 38 years— Near his house stands a Bass wood tree, from 20 to 25 years old—apparently from an old stump, and surrounded by successers. It was under the original stock of that tree then old and large that the British General Frazier received his mortal wound.— Burgoyne had descended along the Southern banks of the Hudson river, till he came to the spot where the village of the Springs now stands, when he crossed the river to assail and disperse the force which was then assembling on the Eastern banks to meet him— Burgoyne had assumed his position in August and on the 19th. of September he made a general assault upon the American lines which extended down to the river— The battle began at two in the afternoon, and was -tinued until the darkness of night came on; when the two parties remained in possession each, of their own intrenchments as before— On the 7th. of October Burgoyne made his second attack, later in the day, and that also was terminated by the night when both parties again retired to their own intrenchments—but that day decided the fate of the War— A post had been assumed by a detachment of Gates’s army South and East of all the lines to outflank the British, and commanded by Coll. Morgan— A corps of the British army was despatched to force this position, commanded by General Frazier— They met and a conflict of 52 minutes ensued. Mr Neilson conducted us to the stone wall bounding the road, overshadowed by the Bass wood tree within the enclosure: stretching his arm over the wall and pointing to the spot where Morgan’s intrenchments had stood—here—said he—bloody work was done on that day— Then pointing to a knoll about 30 rods from the tree, he said, a rifle ball from that knoll, struck General Frazier and he fell. His corps discouraged by the loss of their leader, retired to their intrenchments, and the fortune of the day was decided— The next day Burgoyne commenced his retreat and reached a place now called Schuylerville distant from the heights about ten miles, pursued by Gates and his army—swelling by daily accessions of militia, till Burgoyne with about 7500 men left of his force, was completely hemmed in and on the 17th. of October surrendered by capitulation.— We took a collation at Mr Walker’s house. His son a youth of nineteen or twenty shewed us a guinea of 1775. and two Spanish pillar dollars, which he had dug or ploughed up yesterday on the field of battle— He had also many other waifs and derelicts of War which have been found from time to time under the same grounds—bullets—rifle balls; grape shot—part of a shoe-buckle—one broken skull, and sundry other human bones— He has a wife, two sons and two daughters whom we saw; and four other daughters married— We returned to the Springs about 5. p.m—walked to the circular rail-way and swung round it with John-Quincy— Visited Monsieur Edouarts collection of Silhouettes and spent the Evening in the drawing room— "

At 6. yesterday morning I had been startled by the sound of a band of Music, close to the Congress Spring, within sight and hearing of my chamber window— They played a succession of delightful airs for the space of an hour, while at the same time a cluster of persons were coming and going to and from the Spring, under a shed, where three or four boys were drawing from the well tumblers, nested in tin cases the water, each of which was taken and quaffed by the successive visitors who drank and departed. This morning at precisely 6 the same Scene presented itself— I wrote and listened to the music till 7. and then went and took a warm bath Fahrenheit 96. at the Hamilton Spring. But that as I afterwards found was not the proper time for the bath; but at 11. or 12 before dinner.

At 2. we dined, and at 3. our party, with Mr and Mrs Joseph Grinnell, Miss Cornelia Grinnell, their niece and adopted daughter, and Miss Caroline E. Otté, Miss Grinnell’s Governess or companion, started in the Stage; with three cheers from a crowd of person’s who had assembled in front of the Union hall to witness our departure, and just before 9 in the evening, arrived at the lake house, in Caldwell at the head of Lake George 27 miles from Saratoga Springs. The road heavy and tedious, deep sand most of the way and high hills— At 18 miles from the Springs we stop’d to examine Glen’s falls, which are very considerable. "

                "text": "15. IV. Saturday  The Steamer Whitehall Captain Lyon, is a beautiful boat, with a most obliging and intelligent commander. His wife, a handsome and pleasing woman was on board yesterday; but landed at Burlington, whence we in the Steamer about 9 last Evening proceeded on our voyage, passing by Plattsburg in the Night— The Captain insisted upon giving up his cabin to me, and I never passed a night in a more comfortable bed chamber. About one in the morning the boat was moored to a wharf at Champlain, in shallow water, opposite a small island, and hard by Rous’s point—the navigation of the lake being about there so obstructed by shoals, that the boats venture no further without daylight— We were to stop from one to four in the morning— Soon af- that I saw the Sun majestically rise, over Champlain, in the summer morning of a beautiful village, with the spire of a Church peering up from its surrounding trees— But the boat did not move, and by 5. O’Clock a fog arose and thickened till the Sun was lost in gloom for the space of three hours— I retired to my cabin and wrote till the Sun came out again; mean time the boat started, and passed by the ruined fort on Rous’s point, and the land mark of Latitude 45. the boundary between the United States, and the British Province of Canada, unseen by me. At the head of the lake the river Richelieu leads to St. John’s where it takes the name of the Sorel to pass into the St. Laurence— The passage from Whitehall at the foot of Lake George, where we landed yesterday, adjoining Ticonderoga, to St. John’s in Canada is 160 miles, which we traversed in 19 hours. It should have been in 16 or at most 17.— But our detention at Champlain by the fog belated our arrival at St. John’s at 7. or 8. till near 10. The railway cars had started at 9.—and the next train was to leave at a quarter before 2— Captain Lyon had dressed out the boat in all the colours he had on board. The 85th. regiment of British light infantry is quartered at St. John’s—we landed and went to the hotel kept by Mr Morehead— He introduced to us a Commissary of the army named Lister, and he soon introduced Major French the present commander of the Regiment. We visited with him the barracks; and the regular exhibition of the parade was made, apparently in compliment to us.— The heat was intense— The manoeuvres on the field, merely good—not of ideal perfection— Major French himself gave the word of command with adequate precision and accuracy. We returned to the hotel and dined. We invited Mr Lister to dine with us, but he declined. A quarter before 2 we took the rail-way cars 17 miles to La Prairie— Major French was at the depot, to take leave— From La Prairie a Steamer took us 9. miles to Montreal where we stop’d about 2 hours at Doolittle’s hotel: took a glance inside of the cathedral; embarked in the Steamer Queen Captain Roach, and started from the wharf at 6 in the afternoon for Quebec— Two Officers of the army—Coll. Gore, and Coll. J. Campbell introduced themselves to me, and Coll. Campbell gave me a Letter for Lieutt. Coll. Walker, Commander of the Royal Artillery at Quebec— "

                "text": "15. IV. Saturday  The Steamer Whitehall Captain Lyon, is a beautiful boat, with a most obliging and intelligent commander. His wife, a handsome and pleasing woman was on board yesterday; but landed at Burlington, whence we in the Steamer about 9 last Evening proceeded on our voyage, passing by Plattsburg in the Night— The Captain insisted upon giving up his cabin to me, and I never passed a night in a more comfortable bed chamber. About one in the morning the boat was moored to a wharf at Champlain, in shallow water, opposite a small island, and hard by Rous’s point—the navigation of the lake being about there so obstructed by shoals, that the boats venture no further without daylight— We were to stop from one to four in the morning— Soon af- that I saw the Sun majestically rise, over Champlain, in the summer morning of a beautiful village, with the spire of a Church peering up from its surrounding trees— But the boat did not move, and by 5. O’Clock a fog arose and thickened till the Sun was lost in gloom for the space of three hours— I retired to my cabin and wrote till the Sun came out again; mean time the boat started, and passed by the ruined fort on Rous’s point, and the land mark of Latitude 45. the boundary between the United States, and the British Province of Canada, unseen by me. At the head of the lake the river Richelieu leads to St. John’s where it takes the name of the Sorel to pass into the St. Laurence— The passage from Whitehall at the foot of Lake George, where we landed yesterday, adjoining Ticonderoga, to St. John’s in Canada is 160 miles, which we traversed in 19 hours. It should have been in 16 or at most 17.— But our detention at Champlain by the fog belated our arrival at St. John’s at 7. or 8. till near 10. The railway cars had started at 9.—and the next train was to leave at a quarter before 2— Captain Lyon had dressed out the boat in all the colours he had on board. The 85th. regiment of British light infantry is quartered at St. John’s—we landed and went to the hotel kept by Mr Morehead— He introduced to us a Commissary of the army named Lister, and he soon introduced Major French the present commander of the Regiment. We visited with him the barracks; and the regular exhibition of the parade was made, apparently in compliment to us.— The heat was intense— The manoeuvres on the field, merely good—not of ideal perfection— Major French himself gave the word of command with adequate precision and accuracy. We returned to the hotel and dined. We invited Mr Lister to dine with us, but he declined. A quarter before 2 we took the rail-way cars 17 miles to La Prairie— Major French was at the depot, to take leave— From La Prairie a Steamer took us 9. miles to Montreal where we stop’d about 2 hours at Doolittle’s hotel: took a glance inside of the cathedral; embarked in the Steamer Queen Captain Roach, and started from the wharf at 6 in the afternoon for Quebec— Two Officers of the army—Coll. Gore, and Coll. J. Campbell introduced themselves to me, and Coll. Campbell gave me a Letter for Lieutt. Coll. Walker, Commander of the Royal Artillery at Quebec— "

                "text": "16. IV. Sunday  The distance from Montreal to Quebec on the St. Lawrence is 180 miles which we traversed in 11. hours— But soon after we left Montreal, the night came on and we saw no more of the Country. The Steamer Queen is a very fine boat, but met with an accident some time since and was sunk— She has been very lately raised, repaired and painted, the smell of which was very offensive— The hand or foot could scarcely touch anything without sticking to it.— There was another Steamer too, the Lord Sydenham, in competition with the Queen; and the pressure of Steam, for this race was excessive upon both— That upon the Queen at one time became alarming and they were obliged to stop the boat and let off the steam for the space of at least ten minutes.— The pinewood fire too threw out burning charcoal cinders in showers upon the upper deck, and made it at once dirty and uncomfortable. I had to myself however a good State room, with two berths but without a table, so that I could not write and did not open my trunk.— Before 10. I turned in and slept sound till day light— I rose at 4. saw the Sun rise from the upper deck, opposite the village and church of St. Nicholas, 15 miles from Quebec where we landed precisely at 5. O’Clock— The Ladies then rode, and the men walked up, like scaling the walls to Payne’s Hotel on the Square where the parade of the troops is held; adjoining the place d’Armes.— The first thing I did was to sally forth in quest of a barber— I found one, named Tessier, a native of Quebec, whom I finally prevailed upon with not a little difficulty to shave me.— At breakfast we met a gentleman named Frazier, a Scotch Presbyterian, who offered us seats in his pew in the Scotch church of St. Andrew; which Mr Brooks and I accepted— The preacher was a Dr Cook— His text was from Genesis 4.3. [“]And in process of time, it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the Lord. 4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat there of: And the Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering— 5. But unto Cain, and to his offering he had not respect.” We dined at one O’Clock, and at 2. attended the evening service of the English episcopal church for the troops of the garrison.— The several regiments were marched in full uniform accompanied by their Officers but without their firearms into the church, where the chaplain to one of their regiments the 68th. 81st. and 82d. read the evening prayers for the 5th. Sunday after Trinity, and preached from Job. 42.3. “Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not: things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.”— After Church I took a ride with Mr and Mrs Grinnell and Mrs Charles to the plains of Abram and in the Country round the City of Quebec, which is beautiful, and richly cultivated— Evening walk on the platform— "

                "text": "17. IV. Monday.  In our excursion yesterday afternoon we observed two monuments, upon which I stop’d to read the inscriptions.— The first is an obelisk 65 feet high, adjoining the entrance to the glacis of Cape Diamond fronting the river eastward— On the South side of the pedestal is carved in large relief the name of Wolfe—on the North side that of Montcalm. In the front are the two following inscriptions—  Mortem Virtus. Communem Famam Historia Monumentum  Posteritas dedit   and below  Hujusce Monumenti, in Memoriam Virorum Illustrium Wolfe et Montcalm Fundamentum P. C. Georgius Comes De Dalhousie, In Septentrionalis Americae Partibus ad Britannos Pertinentibus Summam Rerum Administrans; Opus per multos Annos Praetermissum (Quid Duci Egregio Convenientius?) Auctoritate Promovens. Exemplo Stimulans, Munificentia Fovens, Die Novembris XVâ A.D. MDCCCXXVII, Georgio IV. Brittaniarum Rege.  The first of these inscriptions is good: and the simple names of Wolfe and Montcalm at the opposite sides in good taste.— The second inscription is a newspaper puff in honour of Earl Dalhousie, barely noticing the names of Wolfe and Montcalm, but magnifying the Scotch Laird Governor General Dalhousie, into an egregious chieftain, with the word convenientius of very dubious latinity.— I could not help thinking of the famous specimen of the bathos— And thou, Dalhousie, the great God of War   Lieutenant Colonel to the Earl of Mar.  It is indeed highly creditable to this last Dalhousie, that he did accomplish the erection of this monument, but he should not have suffered this pompous panegyric upon himself to be inscribed upon its front in substitution of some brief but pathetic allusions to the illustrious rivals in life and death, themselves.  The other monument is on the plains of Abram— A plain stone broken column about eight feet high from the ground, with a small square basement surrounded by loose stones cemented together on a low gently rising mound with the words deeply carved on the shaft  Here  Wolfe Fell  Victorious.  It is a sad eye sore to monumental glory that this inscription is so defaced by the chipping off from the Letters of the word victorious, and from the name of Wolfe, that they are scarcely legible— A person present said this defacemt had been made within the last two years.  On rising this morning, I went out to the platform to see the Sun rise across the river— A solitary centinel was walking to and fro on his guard, and as I passed by him said in a low desponding tone—Sir—can you tell me what O’Clock it is?— I answered, half past 4. The Sun was then about ten minutes risen—on returning from the precipitous edge of the platform which looks down on the tops fifty feet below of a street of houses, I asked the centinel the name of a point across the river—he said he did not know. He had been here not more than a month, and came last from Jamaica. I passed on to the next Centinel at the wicket gate entrance to the glacis of Cape Diamond, and before the obelisk and asked him the name of the point— He did not know— It was point Levy—and at some distance beyond it was the Island of Orleans— After Breakfast an Irish waiter at the Inn shewed me the way to the residence, at the Artillery Barracks of Lieutt. Coll. Walker commander of the Artillery, to whom I delivered the Letter which Coll. Campbell had given me in the Steamer Queen on our passage from Montreal— Coll. Walker’s reception of me was not so cordial, as the gift of the Letter had been by Coll. Campbell— It was cold but civil, as I have often found the receipt of commendatory Letters— He invited me however to the Lunch at the mess-room at one O’Clock, but I told him I was going to the Falls of Montmorenci, and should not be back till later. He led me however to a spot in the garden, where there was a ladder by which I mounted on the glacis and had a beautiful view of the city below the rivers and country around and the distant mountains. He asked me if I had called upon the commanding officer of the city, Sir James Hope. I had not— On my return to Payne’s Hotel, I found a Barouche at the door, and immediately went with Miss Grinnell, Miss Otté and Mr Leupp, and Mr Brooks’s Coachman Perry, nine miles to the falls of Montmorenci— Mr Bowden with my Grandson John Quincy went separately in a Calèche, and returned an hour before us— After passing a clumsy wooden bridge over the river St. Charles, the road is a turnpike, lined with a continuous village of French cottages and chaumières, interspersed with a few handsome and costly houses surrounded by cultivated farms— The country has an appearance of general ease and comfort— The houses of one story, deep slanting roofs with Lutheran windows sometimes with a second set over them, built of wood or stone bare or plastered over with shingled or thatched roofs, and the sides of the houses sometimes of plank, perpendicularly laid— The population is generally good looking and healthy; but we saw several women in the kitchen garden adjoining every habitation, hoeing and digging the vegetables, and others with the men making hay.— About half way to the falls by the side of the road, was a column on a pedestal surmounted by a corinthian capital with inscriptions on three sides of the pedestal, imparting that the monument was erected by the inhabitants of the parish of Beauport in gratitude to the blessed virgin, for the success of the temperance reform in that parish—we viewed the falls first on the North side then on the South, and lastly on the river strand below; the descent to and ascent from which were so steep that the Ladies did not attempt it— We returned to the city about 3. p.m and I received visits from Coll. Walker, who agreed to accompany us at 9. to-morrow morning to the Citadel, and from the English Bishop of Montreal Dr Mountain— There had been cards while I was absent from L’Eveque de Sidyme, and sundry Priests—the Mayor of Quebec, and C. S. Bourne—a Stranger "

Walker came at 9. with Major Cole the commandant of the Citadel— In consideration of the rain we agreed to postpone our visit to the citadel till one O’Clock, and then to meet the Officers there. In the meantime I had what I sadly want on this journey, leisure to keep along the record without running into irretrievable arrears.— When the weather held up I visited with Mr Grinnell the Roman Catholic cathedral, a very large and massive building where we found some enfans trouvés on their knees at their devotions— There are numerous paintings suspended to the walls, from the legends of the Saints, the subjects of which I did not understand; but some of them ludicrous as caricatures. All indifferent as works except one of the annunciation, which Mr Grinnell pointed out to me, as a good picture— There was one the virgin, a full length with her arms expanded, and streams of radiance from her hands like the tail of the comet last February— Sir James Hope the present commander in chief of the place called on me, and urged me with great earnestness to stay another day, and dine with him to-morrow— We had engaged for our passage in the Steamer Montreal at 5 this afternoon— Sir James was extremely polite, and profuse in his offers of service. At one we visited the citadel accompanied by Lieutt. Coll. Walker, on horseback, and received by Major Cole with very engaging attentions— The batteries of iron 32 pounders and brass 6 pounders are like those of other fortresses; but the prospects from the several bastions, were variegated beautifull and grand.— I went out in the barouche with Mr Grinnell and two of the Ladies, to search for the spot where Montgomery fell but could not find it— There are different traditionary accounts of it, some saying it was on the spot where now stands the Prescott gate, through which we passed. Others that it was close to the custom-house, near the spot where we landed from the Steamer Queen— We traversed the lower city upwards of a mile, along the margin of the river; not so rich as Pearl Street in New-York and more like wapping. At 3 we dined and at 1/2 past 4. left Payne’s Hotel and embarked in the Steamer Montreal, Captain Armstrong— While at the wharf, Mr C. S. Bourne, who had yesterday left a visiting card for me at Payne’s hotel came on board, introduced himself to me, and expressed his regret that the shortness of our stay at Quebec had deprived him of the opportunity of rendering me any service in his power there. He said he was a native of Virginia, and had somehow become a subject of Queen Victoria he supposed; but that his affection for his native Country was as warm, as it ever had been—was inextinguishable— That he was proud of being one of her Sons; and then he complimented me personally, and took his leave as the boat was about to start— She parted from the wharf precisely at 5.— There was on board as a fellow passenger a Philadelphia lawyer named Brown, a Son of the late novelist Charles Brockden Brown, who was introduced to me, and entered immediately into conversation with me, which with the intervention of half an hour for tea continued with deep interest till past 11. O’Clock, when Mr Grinnell called me up on deck to contemplate the rising moon and the firmament of Stars. "

I was roused this morning at early dawn, by the noise in the boat with she stop’d at the landing of trois rivières; but did not get up till after she had left that place and was again on her way— At Sunrise the weather was cold as with us is usual in the last fortnight of September I found on the promenade deck aft of the gate between the deck and cabin passengers two men lying stretched on the floor of the deck, without bed, blanket sheet or coverlet; and on the forecastle ten or twelve others in the same condition. They were all sound asleep— They rose successively between 5 and 6. Then shook themselves stretched their arms, yawned and were ready for the day. I could not but think what a useless and debilitating luxury are all beds and bedding: and incline to the opinion that it would be a great improvement in the education of children to accustom them to coucher sur la dure, but after traversing the deck up and down about 2 hours, I got chilled and retired to my berth in my State room—till just at 7. O’Clock the Steamer was moored to the fire stone wharf landing at Montreal— A man from Doolittle’s exchange Hotel immediately came on board and delivered to me a Letter from my Son to his wife— Mr Brown immediately left us to pursue his journey to the Saratoga Springs. We had hesitated whether we should not at once pursue ours to the Niagara falls, but concluded at last to pass one Night at Montreal. We took lodgings at Doolittles, and sallied forth for curiosities— Before I reached the Hotel I was accosted by Mr Frothingham, whom I had met in September 1840. in Nova-Scotia, and passed a day with him at Kentville, and now loaded us with civilities and attentions— Two Gentlemen, a Yankee by the name of Lyman, and a Scotchman, name not remembered, as a deputation from the Mercantile library association of Montreal, invited us to their rooms and urged me to deliver a Lecture to them this evening, which I declined. Another deputation from the New-England men settled at Montreal invited me also to address them which I likewise declined. Many of them visited me at the Hotel, of whose names I can give no account— We visited the convent of the grey Nuns, at once an Orphan and a Lunatic Asylum— A foundling baby not 3 days old was brought in, not an hour before our visit— Of the maniacs we saw more than enough— We visited also the parade of the 71st regiment of light infantry—Highlanders.— A part of their band of music were 6 pipers with their appropriate dress and feather— And we were visited after the parade by their commander Lieutenant Coll. England, and by Captain H. E. Austen.— Among our other visitors, were Mr Day a native of Connecticut, nephew of the President of Yale College and now a judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench in Canada— With him and Mr Frothingham, after dinner we rode round the mountain stopping on the way at Mr Frothingham’s house; a beautiful retreat about 2 miles out of the city.

Thursday—  Mr Leupp and Mr Bowden, who have been travelling with us from Saratoga Springs left us at 9 this morning to pursue their journey to the white mountains of New-Hampshire— Mr Leupp is a young man, an adopted Son of the late Gideon Lee of New-York a former Member of Congress and of the Committee of Manufactures—a conservative Jackson democrat and Harrison whig.— He died within the last two years and left large property to his daughter, married to Mr Leupp— She also died last year at 23. with an infant, and he is a disconsolate widower travelling pour se distraire— Mr Bowden is younger a student of divinity at the episcopal seminary of New-York— They have been social and agreeable companions, and we, especially the Ladies, urged them to continue with us, and parted from them with regret.— My only visitors were the Mayor of Montreal and Doctor Beaubien a member of the City Council both French Canadians, extremely courteous in their regret that the shortness of our stay deprived them of the opportunity of displaying their hospitalities— I took a last walk round the Streets, and purchased as a lasting memento of Montréal a hatchet hammer— At Noon we departed in a Stage— Judge Day, called to take leave just as we entered the carriage— We came 9 Miles to La Chine a small village where we found a Steamer which took us 24 miles to the Cascades. In this boat we dined, and the ever varying beauties of the river, were somewhat modified by swarms innumerable of flies first met at La Chine— The Captain of the boat said they were called eel flies, and were very troublesome for about a month— They were of five or six different forms; one, the least numerous identical with the fish fly of the Potowmac— One a large ant with wings double its own length; two of the moth tribe one as large as the larva of a silk worm, the other that of the common moth. None of these except the last had the impudent familiarity of the common fly—none of them approached the person, but they were crawling about the decks and swarms of them were flying in the wake of the boat and in the air along the shores, all the afternoon till Sunset— At the Cascade, a Stage was ready, and took us 16 miles to the coteau du Lac, the whole distance on the bank of the river obstructed by a constant succession of foaming rapids against which steam itself cannot make head. From Coteau du Lac another Steamer took us after a magnificent Sunset 41 miles to Cornwall, during two hours of this passage we turned into our berths and slept. At 10 p.m, another stage took us over a heavy road of deep sand to Dickinson’s landing where we arrived at Midnight, having traveled by Stage and Steamer 102 miles since noon. Here we found the Steamer Queen Victoria at the wharf waiting for us, and Mr John Fine, who had come from Ogdensburg to invite me to spend a day there. Mr Fine had induced the Captain to make special arrangements for the accommodation of our party, and he gave up his own cabin to me for the Night— The boat is moored to the wharf and is to depart at 4 in the morning.

Captain Elmsley had ceded to me his own cabin, but for the conveniencies of every kind and especially for writing it could bear no comparison with that of Captain Lyon of the Steamer Whitehall on lake Champlain— On rising therefore I went upon the promenade deck, and there beheld twenty-five women and ten or twelve children, all half clad, in ragged and tattered garments, stretched at full length on dirty rags and blankets, with here and there a featherless apology for a bed or pillow—all locked up in sound and quiet sleep.— The Sovereign, was cleaving at the rate of 12 miles an hour the glassy waters of Lake Ontario, close on the British shore of the lake, and a boundless expanse of waters on the other side— I walked upwards of an hour on the deck winding my way between these happy Sleepers, without disturbing them, till the mate came on deck, and speaking in a high tone of voice said come! come! tumble up! tumble up! when they awoke—started upon their bare feet, stretched their arms, shook themselves; packed up in the blankets or sheets on which they had lain,—each the sum total of her bedding, and went forward where was another company not quite so destitute of Scottish emigrants— The others were Irish— The town of Cobourg soon came in sight 110 miles from Kingston shortly before reaching it we passed by a Light house seeming to float on the Lake. It stands on a Rock the peak of which is just level with the surface of the water— The boat stop’d at Cobourg and again 7 miles beyond at Port Hope at each of which places several of the Scotch passengers with their luggage and furniture disembarked— Between 2 and 3. Afternoon we landed at Toronto, and after taking a ride round the town in which there was nothing remarkable to remember we again embarked in the Steamer Queen Victoria. At Toronto, Captain Elmsley’s wife a handsome and elegant woman, the daughter he said of a judge, as he was the son of another, and he introduced her to our Ladies— We left Toronto at 5. p.m. and crossed the Lake to Niagara and Queenstown whence the steamer passed over and landed us at Lewistown— The passage from Toronto to Niagara is 35 miles to Lewistown 7 miles more, and thence by a horse rail way seven Miles to Niagara Falls.— From Kingston to Toronto is 177 miles. We rode in the dark from Lewistown, and reached the Cataract house at the Falls at 9 in the Evening 438 miles from Montreal in 2 days and 9 hours. We found at the Falls, Mrs N. L. Frothingham, and three of her Sons, Octave, Francis andMr Silliman of New-York with his Sister, and multitudes of others. "

I slept to the sound of the Cataract, and on rising this morning before the Sun I saw the foam of the rapids hurrying to the Falls, right under my window. We breakfasted at 1/2 past 7. with about 150. other visitors to the falls.— Immediately after breakfast General Peter B. Porter came over from his house nearly opposite our hotel, and insisted with so much cordiality on my removal to his house that I consented with great reluctance to part from my company for the time— The houses being so near together that it is little more than occupying a distant apartment of the hotel. I went over, and he introduced to me his daugter 19, his son and namesake 16. a student about to commence junior Sophister at Harvard University, now here in vacation before commencement— His brother’s Son, Peter B. junr. already a middle aged, intelligent active and respected man. Mrs Holley a relative visitor here; and Mr Kelly and Irishman apparently the General’s Secretary, or homme d’Affaires— I met here also Mr Stow, a Gentleman who some weeks since came to Quincy with an earnest invitation from General Porter to me to visit him, which I then declined, and expected never to be able to accomplish.— I enquired for a church to go to for public worship, and found there was a methodist, and a presbyterian church near the hotel, but that attendance at church was not fashionable among the visitors at the falls— But Mr Silliman had formed a party to go to the Tuscarora Indian Settlement 7 miles from the falls, and attend at their church service— General Porter took Mr and Mrs Grinnell and me with him in his carriage and we reached the church while they were singing just before the sermon— An orthodox Presbyterian Calvinist Missionary was the preacher, and in the pulpit which was like the bench of a judicial Court, he and an Indian Chief interpreter stood side by side— The text was from Lukethe parable of the Sower and the seed—the way side hearers and the Stony-ground hearers.— The Indian chief interpreted sentence by sentence, what was said by the missionary— A collection was taken up for a sick and destitute Old woman— The Missionary at suggestion of Genl. Porter announced and the Interpreter repeated that John Quincy Adams once President of the United States was present; whereupon I made to them a short address.— Then at the request of Genl. Porter they sang an English hymn and we departed— On the return we stop’d, and with Mr Grinnell, and Mr Silliman I went down the steps to the whirlpool—an arduous performance— It was between 3. and 4 when we got back to the falls— Dined at General Porter’s with his family and after dinner took a first view of the falls, at the spot at which they are approachable to the very edge of the precipice, and also upon goat or Iris Island. Then returned to the Cataract house, and was detained by visitors till 10 in the Evening when I came to Genl. Porter’s for the Night. "

This morning after breakfast, General Porter, with his nephew and namesake, the judge’s son, took me, with Mr Brooks and Mr Grinnell to a farm house and farm owned by him on the brink of the river two miles above the falls, and to Schlosser a mile or more higher up, and in 1837. the Scene of that memorable transaction, the seizure and destruction by a party from the British side of the river, of the Steamboat Caroline, an incident, which brought us nearer to a British, border and civil war than any other since the Peace of Ghent. At Schlosser there is only a single house but a landing place at the rivers edge— In the middle of the river Navy Island, belonging to the British, and Grand Island, to the United States and part of the State of New-York, both covered with forests of primeval trees are so narrowly separated by the channel of the river, that they seem at Schosser to be one continuous island, and just below them commence the rapids rushing to the falls render the river impassable in boats— There is no trace of the tread of hostile feet remaining, and nothing noticeable on the spot, save its reminiscences. We stop’d at the general’s farmhouse and more solid and more costly lime-stone barn, which Mr Brooks thought would suit well at Medford, and John Quincy thought a very good house to live in— The house-wife of the place by a liberal distribution of dough gathered round us a populous tribe of Turkies, geese, ducks, and dunghill fowls among which the sable crested poularde family from Normandy were conspicuous. The soil of the farm is rich, but bound up in limestone of which the General has made durable and substantial Stonewall fences. The cultivation is in the process of défrichement, with a plenteous kitchen garden and a young orchard surrounded by fields of wheat, barley, oats, corn and potatoes, interspersed with lots of lofty, but girdled forest trees, and others bestudded with stumps standing like the pins of a vast bowling green— We returned to the Falls where Mr: Brooks and Mrs. Charles with her Son dined in family at General Porter’s; and after dinner with all our party we again visited the falls upon goat or Iris Island— There is a kitchen and fruit garden there through which I passed with General Porter; and I went to the top of the tower, built by General Porter at a point on the island whence the view of the falls is on this side the river most grand and picturesque— Returning again to the Cataract house several visitors at the falls were introduced to me and among them Mr Meyer, Minister of a Lutheran Church at Philadelphia, and his two daughters. I received a written invitation from Syracuse to stop and visit the people there. ProfessorMitchell of Cincinnati, came with two Resolutions, from the Astronomical Society of that place, inviting me to lay the corner stone of an Observatory which they are about to erect there: and with Letters from judge Burnet and Mr Pendleton urging me to accept the invitation— I asked Mr Mitchell for a short interval of time, to make up my mind, upon a proposal so strange to me; and so flattering that I scarcely dare to think of it with composure.

This morning I delivered to professor Mitchell my answer to the Resolution of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society of the 18th. instt. inviting me to lay the corner Stone of the observatory which they propose to erect; and to deliver an Oration on the occasion— I have accepted the invitation, and promised to perform the duty; if in my power some day in the month of November next, to suit the convenience of the Society.

Porter to Goat Island to bespeak a warm bath at the bathing house just above the single sheeted fall from which it borrows the stream that supplies the bath— They had then no heated water, but promised to have some ready for me this evening.— I then walked about an hour before breakfast with the General to re-inspect all the points from which the cascades and the rapids are seen to the best advantage— The sky was unusually clear, the Sun shining in cloudless splendour and the snowy foam of the spray reflected the burning beams in a constantly shifting rainbow adding exquisite beauty to the awful grandeur of the falling flood.— After breakfast, General Porter, with Mr Brooks, Mr and Mrs Grinnell, Mrs Charles and her Son, descended the steps to the ferry, and crossed the river in a small ferry boat over a placid and gentle stream scarcely conscious of the falling tempest so close above them— The ascent on the western side, of the river, though steep and rocky, is practicable, and we found at the landing two Carriages waiting for us, in which we ascended the heights, and rode first to view the scene of the Action at Lundy’s Lane on the 5th. of July 1814. in the last War with Great Britain— We then went to the Clifton house and ordered dinner— Then leaving the Ladies there we proceeded to the plains of Chippewa, where General Porter explained to us the movements on the battleground at that place, on the 25th of July 1814 of which day this is the anniversary— Returning we stop’d and saw the phenomenon of the burning spring and I drank a tumbler of its cool sulphuric water.

                "text": "25. IV.30. Tuesday.  This morning I delivered to professor Mitchell my answer to the Resolution of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society of the 18th. instt. inviting me to lay the corner Stone of the observatory which they propose to erect; and to deliver an Oration on the occasion— I have accepted the invitation, and promised to perform the duty; if in my power some day in the month of November next, to suit the convenience of the Society. This is a rash promise, and in faithfully analysing my motives for making it I wish I could find them pure from all alloy of vanity, and self-glorification. It is an arduous, hazardous and expensive undertaking, the successful performance of which is more than problematical and of the event of which it is impossible for me to forseee any thing but disappointment— Yet there is a motive pure and elevated and a purpose benevolent and generous, at least mingling with the impulses which in this case I obey, and upon which I may without irreverence invoke the blessing of Heaven as I do, for fortitude, energy and perseverance to accomplish what I have promised— Mr Mitchell after receiving my answer, took his departure to return to Cincinnati— Mr. Millard Fillmore and MrLove, heretofore members of Congress came this day, deputed from the City of Buffalo to invite me to visit that place, and Mr Fillmore delivered to me a similar written invitation signed by 13 citizens of Syracuse— I went this morning with Genl. Porter to Goat Island to bespeak a warm bath at the bathing house just above the single sheeted fall from which it borrows the stream that supplies the bath— They had then no heated water, but promised to have some ready for me this evening.— I then walked about an hour before breakfast with the General to re-inspect all the points from which the cascades and the rapids are seen to the best advantage— The sky was unusually clear, the Sun shining in cloudless splendour and the snowy foam of the spray reflected the burning beams in a constantly shifting rainbow adding exquisite beauty to the awful grandeur of the falling flood.— After breakfast, General Porter, with Mr Brooks, Mr and Mrs Grinnell, Mrs Charles and her Son, descended the steps to the ferry, and crossed the river in a small ferry boat over a placid and gentle stream scarcely conscious of the falling tempest so close above them— The ascent on the western side, of the river, though steep and rocky, is practicable, and we found at the landing two Carriages waiting for us, in which we ascended the heights, and rode first to view the scene of the Action at Lundy’s Lane on the 5th. of July 1814. in the last War with Great Britain— We then went to the Clifton house and ordered dinner— Then leaving the Ladies there we proceeded to the plains of Chippewa, where General Porter explained to us the movements on the battleground at that place, on the 25th of July 1814 of which day this is the anniversary— Returning we stop’d and saw the phenomenon of the burning spring and I drank a tumbler of its cool sulphuric water. Dined at the Clifton house— Visited the table rock and the cavern under it— Returned over the ferry. Warm bath— Evening party at Genl. Porter’s. "

                "text": "28. V:30. Friday  I had about 2 hours this morning to retrieve one day of arrears, which since I left Quebec have crept upon my diary, in spite of every possible exertion— The lapse of unrecorded time constantly reminds me of that irresistible current which hurries down and dashes over the cataracts at Niagara— So am I hurried down the stream of time, and day after day, turns over the precipice and is lost.— We breakfasted at the Hotel, and as were about passing into the Cars, Mr Isaac Mills, the Mayor of Rochester sent to our Ladies a basket of delicious black heart and white heart cherries, perfectly ripe, and of a size such as I have not seen for many years. Mr Grainger and Mr Jared Wilson accompanied us to Canandaigua whence they had been sent as a deputation to meet us— At the entrance of the town we met a cavalcade in military uniform, with a band of music and numerous carriages, all of which united in a procession of a full mile, with bells ringing and a firing of cannon, which left me in amazement to enquire of myself what all this was for— The procession however led me to the brick church, where Mr Francis Granger, introduced me to all the beauty and fashion of Canandaigua, in a highly complimentary address, which I answered as best I could in a speech full of inanity and gratitude— Shame-faced and awkward as I must always be in answering compliments to myself— After the speeches and shaking hands with all the men and women introduced to me in the church, I rode with Mr Francis Granger, whose brother John A. Granger was the Marshal of the day, to the house of his mother, with whom he resides, and where I found his daughter— Thence I went to the splendid mansion of Mr John Greig— A princely palace where I dined with a select party of his friends.

William Stevens Smith of New York who married my sister— The first seven of the children named in the margin with the dates of their birth; were the children of my niece, and grandchildren of my brother Charles—besides which she was the mother of  John Adams. born 3. Octr. 1815. died 29. Novr 1820  Bryan. born 30. April 1819. died 30. Octr 1837  John Adams. born 28. Feby 1821. died 28. Augt. 1839.  My Niece died 4 July 1836.  Mr Johnson marriedhis present wife,—and by her has the two children last named  Mr Ezekiel Bacon called on me early this morning.— Though chairman of the Committee of arrangements for my reception at Utica, such was the confusion in the crowd and darkness of last evening, that he missed of meeting me. I was taken into a Carriage, and brought to Mr Johnson’s through a dense mass of population. I know not how or by whom— They brought me by the torch light procession of the firemen— From the porch of Mr Johnson’s house I thanked them for their kindness and I said I hoped and trusted we should all devote this day to the worship and service of almighty God; and that to-morrow, I should have the happiness of meeting again my fellow citizens face to face, when I should endeavour to find words to thank them for their kindness— Mr Brooks was also lost for some time in the crowd; and Mrs Charles though in the charge of William C. Johnson was so much alarmed that she actually screamed. John Quincy, in charge of Perry, got through without difficulty, and we were all received with kindness and cordiality by Mr Johnson and all his family— This morning, with Mr Brooks, Mr Johnson and Mr Bacon attended us to the episcopal church—where the minister Mr Proal read the morning service for the 7th. Sunday after Trinity and preached an excellent and elegant sermon from Revelation 6.2. “And I saw, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering and to conquer”— Whole family dinner at Mr Johnson’s. After dinner I went with Mr. Bacon to the Dutch Church—where Mr Knox preached from Proverbs, 14.9 “Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour.” The discourse was confined to the first clause of the text— At 7. in the evening, I went again with Mr Bacon to the Presbyterian Church, and heard its Minister, Mr Porter from Psalm 104.34. “My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord.[”] A very cheerful and cheering discourse upon the pleasures of sincere piety.

I have concluded to stay till Wednesday Morning, on a visit to Mr Johnson and his family, and Mr Bacon, and the committee of arrangements for the publication thought it best to postpone that ceremony till 10 O’Clock to-morrow morning to give the opportunity for persons living in the neighbourhood of the city to come in and see the show— And this day was taken to visit the Trenton Falls.— But Mr Brooks’s patience could hold out no longer. He left Utica in the train of Cars for Albany on his return home, taking with him his Coach, driver Perry, and his grandson John Quincy— Mr Alexander Smith eldest son of Mr Johnson, whom we found here on a visit to his father is a practicing lawyer already of some reputation in the city of New-York— He was obliged to return, and left us also at 10.— We then went, a party in two Carriages, and viewed the Trenton Falls: distant 15 miles in a Northern direction from Utica, in the County of Herkimer— The party consisted of Mr and Mrs Johnson, their Sons, William, Charles and Arthur, and their daughter Sarah. Mrs Charles F. Adams, who went in a chaise with William C. Johnson—Mr Joshua A. Spencer the U.S. District Attorney for the Northern District of New-York and myself. The ride was extremely pleasant, and the country all around beautiful and fertile. But the falls belong to a person by the name of Shepherd. There is near them, also belonging to him, a house heretofore kept as a tavern, but now closed and uninhabited. The descent to the falls is as steep, and nearly as deep as that of the whirlpool at Niagara, and the wooden flights of steps, laid to facilitate the descent are rotting into spungy funk every step of which threatens to give way under the foot, and to pitch the traveller into the abyss— The falls of which there are seven within the compass of half a mile are each separately of not more than 40 or 50 feet in sheets of water perhaps 200 feet wide rushing down with terrific violence, and dashing over rocks in many cases turning corners with a force of friction which would seem sufficient to fire the rock— The passage between the two lofty and wood crowned ridges is like a ruptured chasm made by an earthquake, and the concave sides of a limestone wall descending to a level with the stream leaves an edge barely wide enough for the foot of the passenger to step along with the aid of an iron chain fastened to the side of the rock, and held by the left hand as he slides along but wherever the edge of the rock under foot is but a few inches wider the chain is intermitted and the pilgrim staggers along as he may— Within these few years two females, a child of Mr Thorn, the Croesus of New-York, and a Miss Suydam have fallen and been plunged into eternity while visiting this Scene for curiosity— Near the last of the falls there is a small shed inhabited as a dwelling house by a son of Henry R. Storrs, where we found a draught of spruce beer, and benches on which we disposed of the basket of Sandwiches brought with us from Utica.— We returned from this hovel in our Carriages to the uninhabited house, where we met Miss Van der Kemp, the daughter of the late Francis Adrian Van der Kemp and Miss Mappa a daughter of his associate.— They live with one of his Sons, in a small house where he resided in a village now called Russia, but which he called Olden Barnevelt— We visited them there; and returned to Utica, between 6 and 7. in the Evening well wearied and worn out— The visit to the Trenton falls is imminently dangerous— Yet the Johnson’s trip over it, like Rope dancers on a tight rope.

                "text": "31. IV.30. Monday.  I have concluded to stay till Wednesday Morning, on a visit to Mr Johnson and his family, and Mr Bacon, and the committee of arrangements for the publication thought it best to postpone that ceremony till 10 O’Clock to-morrow morning to give the opportunity for persons living in the neighbourhood of the city to come in and see the show— And this day was taken to visit the Trenton Falls.— But Mr Brooks’s patience could hold out no longer. He left Utica in the train of Cars for Albany on his return home, taking with him his Coach, driver Perry, and his grandson John Quincy— Mr Alexander Smith eldest son of Mr Johnson, whom we found here on a visit to his father is a practicing lawyer already of some reputation in the city of New-York— He was obliged to return, and left us also at 10.— We then went, a party in two Carriages, and viewed the Trenton Falls: distant 15 miles in a Northern direction from Utica, in the County of Herkimer— The party consisted of Mr and Mrs Johnson, their Sons, William, Charles and Arthur, and their daughter Sarah. Mrs Charles F. Adams, who went in a chaise with William C. Johnson—Mr Joshua A. Spencer the U.S. District Attorney for the Northern District of New-York and myself. The ride was extremely pleasant, and the country all around beautiful and fertile. But the falls belong to a person by the name of Shepherd. There is near them, also belonging to him, a house heretofore kept as a tavern, but now closed and uninhabited. The descent to the falls is as steep, and nearly as deep as that of the whirlpool at Niagara, and the wooden flights of steps, laid to facilitate the descent are rotting into spungy funk every step of which threatens to give way under the foot, and to pitch the traveller into the abyss— The falls of which there are seven within the compass of half a mile are each separately of not more than 40 or 50 feet in sheets of water perhaps 200 feet wide rushing down with terrific violence, and dashing over rocks in many cases turning corners with a force of friction which would seem sufficient to fire the rock— The passage between the two lofty and wood crowned ridges is like a ruptured chasm made by an earthquake, and the concave sides of a limestone wall descending to a level with the stream leaves an edge barely wide enough for the foot of the passenger to step along with the aid of an iron chain fastened to the side of the rock, and held by the left hand as he slides along but wherever the edge of the rock under foot is but a few inches wider the chain is intermitted and the pilgrim staggers along as he may— Within these few years two females, a child of Mr Thorn, the Croesus of New-York, and a Miss Suydam have fallen and been plunged into eternity while visiting this Scene for curiosity— Near the last of the falls there is a small shed inhabited as a dwelling house by a son of Henry R. Storrs, where we found a draught of spruce beer, and benches on which we disposed of the basket of Sandwiches brought with us from Utica.— We returned from this hovel in our Carriages to the uninhabited house, where we met Miss Van der Kemp, the daughter of the late Francis Adrian Van der Kemp and Miss Mappa a daughter of his associate.— They live with one of his Sons, in a small house where he resided in a village now called Russia, but which he called Olden Barnevelt— We visited them there; and returned to Utica, between 6 and 7. in the Evening well wearied and worn out— The visit to the Trenton falls is imminently dangerous— Yet the Johnson’s trip over it, like Rope dancers on a tight rope.

                "text": "1. V.15. Tuesday—  I received yesterday a Letter from Daniel Thompson, Benjamin Anderson, and Tucker Woodson, a Committee appointed by the coloured citizens of Utica, to wait on me, and return their thanks for my efforts, in protecting the right of petition, and promoting the abolition of Slavery, and proposing to come, if it would be agreeable to me, in the Evening. I accordingly received them about 8. O’Clock, and one of them addressed me in a short, but formal speech, modest and well delivered. I answered them with equal brevity: thanking them for their kind attentions to me; assuring them that I had no claim to gratitude from them for services in which I had performed no more than my indispensable— That I should still and ever be happy to serve them to the utmost extent of my power, and commend them to the protection of our common father and creator— My first visit this morning immediately after breakfast was to the female Seminary, where I was introduced to the assembled teachers and pupils, and addressed in behalf of the trustees of that institution by Mr Spencer in a manner so affecting that it made a child of me. It consisted chiefly of extracts which he read from my mothers published Letters of 19. August 1774. to my father, and of June 1778 to me.— I actually sobbed as he read, utterly unable to suppress my emotion— Oh! my Mother! Is there any thing on earth so affecting to me as thy name? so precious as thy instructions to my childhood? so dear as the memory of thy life? I answered, I know not what— My thoughts were all upon my mother— My heart was too full for my head to think, and my presence of mind was gone— At the close of his address, Mr Spencer presented to me, at the request of the Ladies 12 numbers of a monthly publication, from August 1842 to July 1843. called the Young Ladies Miscellany the original productions of the Utica female Academy— At 10. O’Clock the reception took place, on a stage erected in front of the Bleecker house; where Mr Bacon addressed and welcomed me in the name of the citizens of Utica: I answered him in a speech of about half an hour, sufficiently cheered for my hopes or wishes, but of mortifying inanity to myself— The shaking of some hundred hands then followed, and on my way, returning to Mr Johnson’s I stop’d and four Daguerrotype likenesses of my head were taken: two of them jointly with the head of Mr Bacon. all hideous— Then a visit to the dwarf. C. F. Stratton called General Tom Thumb. 11 years old—25 inches high; weighing 15 pounds. Dressed in a military uniform, mimicking Napoleon. Dinner party at Mr Johnson’s. Ride after dinner to the Lunatic hospital. John M. Niles, U.S. Senator from Connecticut is there. Thence we went to the York Mills Cotton Factory. where there was a crowd—a reception a procession, an address and speech; and a present of several pieces of the cotton cloth which I declined accepting. Elegant evening party and supper at Mr Johnson’s. "

At ten O’ Clock this morning I met again the People of Albany, in company with Mr Barnard, who addressed and welcomed me in their name, from the stoop of Mr Gregory’s house facing the Capitol Park— There was no public building in the City capable of containing a tythe of the assembled multitude. I answered Mr Barnard’s address, by a speech of about half an hour, well received and of which the only fault which I heard found with it was that it was too short. To myself it was but the crowning proof how unfit I am for such occasions, and a lesson at once of profound gratitude, and humility— When the shouts which followed its close had subsided notice was given to the citizens that I would repair to the Governor’s chamber in the Capitol, and there shake hands with any one who would desire it— About 500 of them, perhaps one tenth of the whole number, went through this ceremony, after which there was a separate presentation to some 200 ladies assembled in the Senate chamber, and to whom I also made a grave, and not a flattering speech— After this I was conducted by the Committee of arrangements and viewed the public Offices of the State Government; and then in another building those of the City. Some of the most antient archives of the State, in the low dutch language were exhibited to me— Among the persons who now accompanied me was Mr Flagg, heretofore the Comptroller of the State. Mr Bouck the Son of the present Governor was among the individuals introduced to me last evening and again this morning— He presented to me his father’s compliments with his regret that he had been obliged to leave the city upon private business yesterday morning. Governor Marcy was among those who met and greeted me as was Mr Edwin Crosswell the somewhat celebrated Editor of the Albany Argus— Mr Van Buren himself is at the Saratoga Springs; as we were informed by Mr Isaac C. Bates who came from thence last Evening;—and proceeded on his journey homeward this morning— After a retirement of two hours to my chamber at Mr Barnard’s for repose, I met at his table a party of about 20. of his friends, among whom were the Mayor of the City and Mr Lansing—General Rufus King, a son of Charles King, Dr Potter, the Rector of the Episcopal church, at which Mr Barnard worships, and others. strangers, whose names I could not retain— After dinner we visited the mansion house of the Patroon, the late Stephen Van Rensselaer, whose eldest son of the same name resides there. He is now absent; but his wife, and her brother in Law and Sister Mr and Mrs Bayard received and treated us with great kindness. The house, about 2 miles out of the city, Garden and Green house are elegant and comfortable— We returned to Albany and the Evening closed, with a party of Ladies and gentlemen given by Mrs Barnard, and from which by a refinement of courtesy to me the Company retired at an early hour.

At half past 6 this morning Mr Barnard took me in his carriage to the landing place in the city of Albany—whence the Steamboat crosses the river Hudson to take the Cars of the great Western Railroad to Boston— He crossed the river with me and took leave of me at the Cars— Mr George N. Briggs had come deputed with an invitation to me, from the inhabitants of Pittsfield; and I had received a written invitation from Mr Edward A. Newton, to take rooms during my visit to Pittsfield at his house— Mr Briggs and another of the deputies accompanied me. The distance from Albany to Boston traversed by the Western Railroad is 200 miles— Pittsfield is 52 miles and Springfield one hundred from Albany— The cars reached Pittsfield at 10 O’Clock in the morning— The road from Albany was the same we had travelled on the 11th. of last month, as far as Canaan where we then came from Lebanon Springs and returned to the train, we had parted from four days before at Pittsfield— We again came through the village of Kinderhoek, and again passed through the subterranean Tunnel.— We passed in sight of Lebanon, which I remembered with pleasure, and, and the spot was pointed out to me of the line which separates from each other the States of New-York and Massachusetts— Mr Newton’s carriage was at the depot in Pittsfield, and I was taken in immediately to his house— It was immediately crowded with visitors; till the citizens were informed that I would meet and exchange salutations with them at the presbyterian church at Noon— In the meantime the Berkshire County Medical Association, casually assembled here upon business of their own, came with their President—at their head—his honour Henry H.

                "text": "6. IV:30. Sunday  Rain all Night and all this day— We rode to Meeting both morning and afternoon and from Meeting. Communion day. Mr Lunt’s morning text was from John 6.56. “He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him.”— This was said in the Asiatic style of figurative language, and even when spoken shocked the multitude of his hearers in the synagogue at Capernaum, so violently that perceiving their astonishment and disgust he explained that he spoke the words in a spiritual sense—not withstanding which the Apostle says, “from that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.” Nor is it surprizing—The source of all figurative language is the analogy between the operations of matter and of mind. In the expression of complicated ideas, there may be points of close and luminous analogy between flesh and spirit, associated with other points of the most abhorrent opposition— The Asiatic or Oriental style, seizes upon one striking point of analogy, and totally suppresses or disregards all other points not harmonizing with it— The Attic or Grecian styles shuns all these complicated analogies, which mislead or confuse the mind, with incongruous ideas and contradictory associations.— It requires harmony of thought—not expecting that the similitude should run upon all fours; but forbidding the attempt walk upon one or limp lamely upon two— When Jesus told his disciples that they must eat his flesh and drink his blood, his allusion was at once to the sacrifice of the paschal lamb, to the institution of the passover and to its connection with the wheat harvest by the eating of unleavened bread— But taken by itself, the declaration that he came from Heaven, commissioned to renovate the nature of man, and that his disciples must begin by eating his flesh and drinking his blood—who could hear him without believing that he was either a maniac, or an impostor— A Canibal, and not a teacher come from God?— The apostles however adhered to him, and afterwards when he kept the passover, immediately preceding his crucifixion, he instituted the perpetual memorial of his death and resurrection, by repeating the same figure—by breaking and distributing the bread as his body, and presenting the cup as his blood.— This incident is not noticed in John’s Gospel but is related in the 26th Chapter of Matthew—the 14th. of Mark, and the 22d. of Luke— Mr Lunt administered the Communion, of which I partook in humiliation and prayer.— The text of the discourse in the afternoon was from Acts 5.1. [“]But a certain man, named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife sold a possession. 2. And kept back part of the price, and brought a certain part, and said it at the apostles feet.” Jesus Christ himself required of his disciples the devotion of all their property to the propagation of faith in him, and in his religion— After his death his disciples, by a common voluntary agreement began by holding all their property in common— But this could not last long, and this case of Ananias and Sapphira was no doubt intended to prove that human nature was not yet sufficiently purified for the practical establishment of this principle, as a permanent institution.— The crime of Ananias and Sapphira, was in the deception which they attempted, to practice; and not in withholding their property.— That the Apostle Peter declared was optional, and after awful example of punishment inflicted upon the fraud, the community of goods was thenceforward abandoned— "

Monday  Franklin White a painter of portraits by trade had called on me, before I went upon my late journey, and requested me to sit to him for my portrait, which I promised to do—after my return— He came this morning and claimed the performance of my promise— And this afternoon he came again and took a sitting of an hour— Mr Samuel Copeland came also with two bills. Lewis Tappan was here with his wife and two daughters but the Ladies declined alighting from his carriage, and he stayed with me but a few minutes— The day after he was here on the 31st. of last May, he embarked for England, and has just now just returned— He attended the second World’s convention held at London from the 18th. to the 22d. of June, and gave me a brief and rapid summary of their proceedings— He said he had a Letter to me from Thomas Clarkson, and sundry papers containing full and detailed reports of the proceedings of the Convention— But they were at Brookline and he would send them to me— He was to go for New-York this afternoon— He said he had told Lord Aberdeen of my distrust of the British Government on the subject of Slavery, and particularly on the surrender of fugitive Slaves. He said Lord Aberdeen was startled at the suggestion, and utterly disclaimed all intention of suffering the tenth Article of the Ashburton Treaty to be made the instrument of reclaiming Slaves— This Article is a pattern example of diplomatic swindling— There is hope that its purpose may be defeated by the alarm of the English abolitionists and their remonstrances against it before the enact of it by Parliament as English Law.— A grosser fraud was never practiced upon nations than was intended by that article— The apologies for it, by Lord Ashburton, and by the British Ministers are lame and prevaricating—and from the statements of Mr Tappan, all my suspicions of the duplicity of the British Ministers, on the subject of Texas and Slavery are but too strongly confirmed.— The policy of the British Government is to cherish sustain and protect the institutions of Slavery in our Southern States, and in Texas, and their task is to do it by humbugging the abolitionists in England into the belief that they intend directly the reverse— Richard C Greenleaf was here with a young man from New-York named Stalknecht an emigrant from Germany, but who has made his way so well in this Country that he has a subordinate Clerk’s office under the Supreme Court of the State of New-York, and is said to be paying his addressed to Mary, the daughter of Mrs Lucy Dawes. Isaac Hull Adams and Francis Frothingham were also here— The weather was dull and gloomy the whole day, and I paid only a transient visit to my garden Nursery and seminary of seedling trees— Enough hower to discover the ravages by the blazing Sun, and the protracted drought, which has burnt up all vegetation here since I left it flourishing on the 6th of July.

Mr and Mrs. Leman were here this morning before 7 O’Clock; and they breakfasted with us— Mr Leman is 70 years of age and I perceived he was labouring under great agitation— He had taken from Mr Curtis and Mrs Alicia Boylston, a Lease of a lot of land in Charlestown, for five years to expire in Novr. 1844. upon which he has erected a building to serve at once for a dwelling house and a Carpenter’s shop. But he gave me a mortgage of the house as security for the timber and planks of which it was built, and now the mortgagees, are making demonstrations and preparations for removing the house, and he is in fear of being turned out of house and home— He has flattered himself with the hope that the house having become a fixture to the soil was real estate and could not be removed without previous process of law; and I countenanced him at first with in that opinion. but recollecting afterwards that a Statute of the Commonwealth gives to the tradesmen working on a building, a lien upon the materials of which it is built, I feared he was leaning upon a broken reed, and advised him to consult with Mr Curtis, and Mr A. C. Spooner—my Son’s associate in the office. N. 23. Court Street to devise some means of extricating him from his perplexity— After Breakfast he wandered with me round the garden and Nursery and took sundry twigs of trees for keepsakes; and took leave My Son gave me a check on the Merchants Bank for 700 dollars, which I deposited in the Quincy Stone bank here, and I settled 2 bills of Samuel Copeland— Isaac Hull Adams and his sister Elizabeth were here— There was a Letter from Mrs Charles F. Adams to her son Henry, from Utica; doubtful whether she would leave that city as she had intended yesterday.— I received also a Letter from C. Oscanyan dated 31. May at Constantinople. He is a native of that city; whence, I know not how, he came to this Country; resided here several years, and married an American woman in New-York— The object of the Letter is to solicit the appointment of Dragoman to the American Legation at the Ottoman Porte— A Sinecure vacated by the decease some months since of Commodore David Porter— Oscanyan was an acquaintance of some of the younger members of my family, and used to visit occasionally at my house, but he is sadly out of his reckoning in applying to me for influence to obtain for him a diplomatic appointment— We had this day two or three thunder showers so that I was much confined to the house, and the contrast between the perpetual motion, the ever gathering crowds of people—the greetings and salutations, and huzzas of the multitudes, with the rapid travelling alternately by Stage, Steamer and railway, and the dark and sullen quietude of my own house thus confuses me and keeps an unseizable cotrarion in my head—a buzzing tintinnabulum which will end in distraction or lethargy— I struggle to recover my self possession and the controul of my thoughts.— They are yet in a whirlwind.

                "text": "9. IV. Wednesday.  Showery day, which still detained me from visitation of my grounds, and from exercise abroad— Mr William Barry was here with a bill for four years subscription to the common school journal. He asked me if I recollected that in the summer of 1809 just before I embarked for St. Petersburg, the hatters of Boston applied to me to draw up for them a memorial to Congress— I remembered it well— He said he was the person who made the application to me— It is noticed in my Diary of 26 June 1809., but the name of the person applying is not reported and I did not now remember that it was Mr Barry.— Isaac H. Adams was also here and Franklin White the painter to whom I gave a second sitting of an hour— It must be extremely difficult for any painter to take a favourable likeness of me now—for I cannot sit five minutes or three or even one, with out, falling into a doze— This propensity which I have long observed grows upon me to such an extent, that I ought to be deeply alarmed at its progress—for its termination may overtake me every day, and every hour of my life— It benumbs every faculty of my body and soul. It portends a moment of Sleep from which there will be no awaking upon earth, and of which I am in constant expectation— When I ask myself why I do not make immediate and effective provision for instantaneous departure whenever that summons shall come, I have no answer to make other than the frailty of my nature— This irresistible spell has made it impossible to take a good daguerrotype likeness of me, and it baffles though not in equal degree the skill of the portrait painter, who cannot give life or animation to a countenance all the muscles of which are all the time lapsing into slumber— It deadens alike all the faculties of the mind, and is a continual warning to me of the decays of my powers native and acquired— Shall I ever take it?— This evening I visited Mr and Mrs Thomas Greenleaf my neighbours each four score years of age— I requested him to mention to their son E. Price, that I wished to see him— My time is now almost entirely consumed in bringing up the arrears into which my journal had fallen in the course of my month’s excursion; and with the most intense exertions, I cannot recover more than one day in a day. Many of the Newspapers have reported the proceedings at the places, where I was received with honorary notice— It began at Saratoga Springs on the 12th. of July— I escaped it not without difficulty at Burlington Vermont— Then after a suspension of one week in Canada, the display was recommenced at Ogdensburg and continued to Pittsfield in Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

At five, I saw a man walking to and fro in the yard fronting my windows between the gate and the porch, without knocking or ringing the bell at the door; and on going down found it was Daniel Leman, the man from Charlestown, but this time without his wife— He came on the same business as before, in terror of having his house taken off over his head. He remained here two hours complaining of the hardness of his fate which was neither more nor less than inability to pay his debts.— Mr Curtis was afterwards here and we concluded to purchase the mortgage on the house, and leave him in possession of the house till the expiration of his lease; leaving him in the interval time for preparing to depart or for procuring the means of paying his rent— Leman’s son was here in the afternoon anxious for the relief of his father, and I informed him of the manner, in which Mr Curtis and I proposed to effect it— Mr Wilder and Mr Hearsey, are a Committee of the Proprietors of the first social Library in the South parish of Hingham; and called on me to enquire if there was not a joint Resolution of Congress, by which that Society are entitled to receive a copy of the diplomatic correspondence published by Congress— I looked over the volumes of the Laws, but could find no such resolution I promised however to make further enquiry, and if I should find they have the right I will take care to procure the books for them— A person by the name of George Piggott came from Boston to make enquiry after Martha Cumming a woman who served as cook, while I was absent, and took a leave of absence for a week and has never returned— Piggott says she boarded at his house, and has gone off in debt to him— She had left her trunk here; but we did not think ourselves authorised to let him have it— Mr E. Price Greenleaf came, and examined some of my stocks of seedling Apple trees— This is the season for that operation, and Mr Greenleaf usually performs it for me. He promised to procure some buds of excellent apples, and to come and bud the trees next Tuesday afternoon, if by that time he can get the slips— I received this morning by the mail the Bangor Courier of thecontaining my Letter of 4 July last to Asa Walker, Charles A. Stackpole, And F. M Sabine. It is announced as a Letter from John Quincy Adams on Slavery—with a statement that it was read at the Meeting on the 1st. of August and without one word of comment upon it— I have expected the publication of this Letter, and expect to be held to severe responsibility for writing it— Before my lamp is burnt out, I am desirous that my opinions concerning the great movement throughout the civilized world for the abolition of Slavery should be explicitly avowed and declared— God grant that they may contribute to the final consummation of that event— There are sundry errors of the press, and of the manuscript to be rectified, and to which I must attend.

Confined of course to the house, and gave a somnolent sitting to Mr Franklin White, who said he should want only one more. My Son went to Boston in the Stage, and while we were at dinner returned home, with his wife, William C. Johnson, and his sister Sarah Adams, named after grandmother, my brother Charles’s wife.— They left Utica Wednesday Morning. Came that day to Albany. Yesterday to Springfield—and landed this day noon at Boston. We went up and spent the evening with them at Charles’s house I received also this morning, forwarded from New-York by Lewis Tappan; a Letter from Thomas Clarkson, of 2 July 1843. at Playford Hall near Ipswich Suffolk in England—with a printed prospectus for the publication of the proceedings of the Anti-Slavery convention held at London, from the 19th. to the 20th. of June last.— A printed address signed by Thomas Clarkson, in behalf of the British and foreign Anti-Slavery Society; dated 7. July 1843. to Lord Aberdeen, and earnestly remonstrating against the annexation of Texas to the United states— The British and foreign Anti-Slavery Reporter of 14. 21. 28 June and 12 July and the morning Chronicle of 14 July. These contain a full exposition of the proceedings of the second World’s convention, at which no very conspicuous person attended excepting Lord Morpeth— His Speech to the Convention on taking the chair, was firm, moderate and discreet— The Resolution honorary to me which he offered, and which was unanimously adopted, is an indication of personal respect for my character beyond the Atlantic which ought to fill my soul with humility and with fervent gratitude to God— These events occuring at the same period with the manifestation of kindly feeling towards me, from the people of the State of New-York, and with the invitation from Cincinnati to lay the corner stone of their observatory, seem temptations of prosperity too great for frail human nature to resist or to bear with impunity. I pray for the calmness and sensibility suited to justice and to the true estimate of worldly honours.— And I received a Letter from Mr Andrews the young lawyer from Texas who visited me the day before he embarked with Mr Tappan for England— He is encouraged in the hope of accomplishing with the aid of British influence the abolition of Slavery in Texas— But I perceive nothing as yet to relieve the deep distrust which I would fain discard if I could, of the British ministerial policy with regard to Slavery in Texas and in our Southern States— Her interest is to sustain and cherish Slavery there, and there is too much reason to surmise, that in the conflict between policy and principle, Slavery with bear off the palm.

Sun rose cloudy.— The return to a sedentary life from a month of great and constant agitation, excitement and over exercise forms a trial of the Constitution— It seems as if a hurricane had passed over my spirits; and now, when they have been a whole week settling down into the ordinary quiet current of rural Summer life, exercise is necessary to save them from falling into Syncope— My time for exercise is from the hour of rising till breakfast; and if I miss it then the day is very apt to slip through without it— For exercise I am obliged to resort to my garden and seedling trees— I emptied a seedling pot into Mary Louisas Seminary plot, where there is now a seedling Apple stock—An Englis Oak and a shagbark walnut, all of the third year— When Mr Curtis was here day before yesterday, I agreed to meet him in Boston next Monday Morning, to execute the deeds of exchange with the purchasers of the Tremont Theatre— Also to meet Mr Fuller the administrator of Moses Gill junr. and endeavour to come to a settlement, at the probate office with him. And further to prepare a Letter to Petty Vaughan at London to be sent by the Acadia to sail for Liverpool next Wednesday— Mr Curtis dined with us and returned home immediately after dinner. This day there were visits from Mr Lunt, and Mr Thomas Loring of Hingham with whom I agreed to go upon our usual annual fishing party from Cohasset, next Thursday. Isaac Hull Adams and his Sister Elizabeth William C. Johnson, and his sister Sarah were here, and the latter is to stay with Mary-Louisa, while upon her visit here— We received a Piano from Boston, upon hire by the week. The Boston Courier of this morning republishes from the Bangor Courier my Letter of 4 July last to the Bangor Committee for celebrating the anniversary of the emancipation of Slaves in the British West India Islands; with all the errors of the Bangor, and several more. Not a word of comment upon the Letter is in either of the papers— I expected the publication of that Letter; and wrote it for the purpose of exhibiting in as brief a compass as possible my principles, feelings and opinions, relating to the abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade throughout the world— I meant it as a note of defiance to all the Slave-holders, Slave traders and Slave breeders upon earth. As the experiment of Summons to the whole Freedom of this Union in its own defence, I sent it forth alone, to try its Fortune in the world, and made it purposely bold and startling, to rouse if possible both friend and foe— The two publications without comment, give no promise of a rally for the support of Freedom. As yet there is no hostile notice of it abroad— It may remain altogether unnoticed, which is the worst fate that can befall it—for if I can but raise a controversy by it—that is; an adversary worthy of being answered, it shall be if my life and health will admit, a text book for future enlargement and illustrative for the whole remnant of my toilsome days.

                "text": "13. V. Sunday.  Dr Frothingham preached, in exchange with Mr Lunt. His morning text was from Psalm 27.3. [“]Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.” The turn of mind of Dr Frothingham is so original that from the enunciation of his text it is impossible to foresee what will be the purport of his discourse— You perceive it as he proceeds and when he comes to the close, you perceive an unbroken chain of close argument, of beautiful order, of lofty moral principle, and of pathetic sentiment pervading the whole composition— In this Sermon, after some general remarks on the character of David, and the prevailing spirit of his Psalms, he analysed the sources of his confidence, not in his own prowess, nor in the efficacy of the means in his own hands for extricating him from the troubles with which in his long and eventful life he had been surrounded, he drew from the text a lesson equally profound and impressive of unwavering confidence in the goodness and mercy of God; enlarging upon the independence with which it endowed the human character of time—of space of good or evil fortune, and even of one’s own errors and imperfections. There is a purity, an elevation, a grandeur in the elemental composition of a man whose confidence in God is thus inextricably rooted, which raises him to the level of angelic nature, and which adapted to the contingencies incidental to the ordinary course of human affairs, touch the heart until it overflows at the eyes: which it did with me this day, mastering all power of resistance. Dr Frothingham dined with us— His Son Octave who is about graduating at Cambridge was with him, but dined with his aunt Charles My Son himself and William C. Johnson dined with us— The text this afternoon was from Acts 23.11. [“]And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul:”— There was a close analogy between the subjects of the two discourses; the incidents in the life and adventures of the Apostle Paul, being eminently suited to illustrate the efficacy of a stedfast confidence in the overruling Providence of God— Immediately after our return from the afternoon meeting; Mr and Mrs Eliot of were here— Mrs Eliot, returning from a visit to her son and daughter at Saint Louis Missouri since last March. Then came Mr Degrand from Boston; and in the evening Mr Beale, Charles and his family. Elizabeth C. Adams and John, and Fanny Foster— A considerable company. Degrand brought out as usual a budget of Newspapers, and among them the Daily Advertiser of yesterday, containing copied from the Pittsfield Eagle, a report of my reception at Pittsfield, the closing scene of that series of receptions and processions which from the borders of Canada to my quiet retirement at home, have signalized the month of my recent excursion as among the most memorable periods of my life.

When I left home on the 6th of last month it was in the printers hands—and I had revised two half proof sheets of it; and my Son afterwards revised the remainder. But I have heard nothing of it since my return— Mr Felt knew nothing about it, but promised to enquire of Mr Francis C. Gray chairman of the printing committee— I left with the Seal-engraver Mitchell the Carnelion stone of Captain Robert C Buchanan, to have the Johnson arms and his cypher engraved upon it according to his directions— At my Son’s Office, Mr Curtis and I as Executors and Trustees of Ward N. Boylston, executed indentures of exchange interchangeably with Timothy Gilbert, Thomas Gould and W. S. Damrell, in behalf of the purchasers of the Tremont Theatre— Mr Bowditch attended as their Counsel. I promised Mr Curtis to prepare a Letter to Petty Vaughan, to be forwarded by the Steamer Acadia, the day after to-morrow— Mr Curtis has purchased the mortgage of the house at Charlestown occupied by Daniel Leman, and leaves him for the present in possession. I met Mr George B. Fuller twice at the Probate Office; and was ready to render my account as Administrator of Thomas Boylston; and to transfer to him the Bank shares for the payment of the debt due to the Estate of Moses Gill—but he was not ready for the production of his account, nor to state the amount of his claim as Gill’s administor against the Estate of Thomas Boylston— The judge therefore postponed the further consideration of the case till next Monday. I called at the Emancipator Office, and enquired of Mr Alden the publisher whether he intended to republish my Letter to the Bangor Committee on Slavery— He said that nearly the whole of it was in type and struck off, on the first page of the paper to be published next Thursday.— He gave me a copy of the paper which I promised to revise. I returned home to Quincy to dine; and after dinner received visits from two black men, named Lewis Nelson from New-York and Peter Avery from Boston— The impression left by the two men was very different— That of Avery quite favourable— I was up till past midnight, writing to Mr Alden, and pointing out the errors of the prose and manuscript, in my Bangor Letter as printed in the Emancipator.

                "text": "15. V. Tuesday  Rain all the morning: confined me to the house. Mr Franklin White had been here on Saturday, but found himself so unwell that he could not take a sitting at that time, but agreed to come again this day— He came accordingly: took a fourth sitting of an hour, and finished the portrait— He is a timid, unobtrusive man, who in the performance of menial services for Harding himself a third rate portrait painter, acquired the talent of taking likenesses in Oil colours: but he can scarcely claim to be called an artist. This is about the 45th. time that I have sitten for my pictures, and I question whether another man lives who has been so wofully and so variously bedaubed as I have been— There is no picture of my childhood but from the age of 16, when I was caricatured it crayons by Mr Schmidt for four ducats, down to this my 77th year, when Mr White has lampooned me in oil, scarcely a year has passed away, without a crucifixion of my face and form, by some painter engraver or sculptor— A miniature, in a bracelet for my mother, painted at the Hague in 1795 by an Englishman named Parker, now in the possession of my Son John’s widow— Copley’s Portrait of 1796.— Stuart’s head of 1825. And Durand’s of 1836. painted for Mr Luman Read, are the only ones worthy of being preserved, with the Busts by Persico, Greenough and Powers— The features of my old age are such as I have no wish to have transmitted to the memory of the next age— They are harsh and stern far beyond the true portraiture of the heart; and there is no ray of intellect in them to redeem their repulsive severity— Mr White stretched the canvas over the frame of the portrait of Edward Boylston, which Mr B. O. Tyler had loosened to spread over it a coat of his varnish. Mr Tyler himself was here— He had written me a long and absurd Letter, proposing to me to lend him several hundred dollars to set him up in his varnishing trade and also to get up an engraving of a family temperance pledge, the sale of which is to make his fortune— I declined his proposal: desired him to spread no more of his varnish upon my house or upon any thing in it; and advised him to wait for the application to him from other persons wanting his varnish rather than to worry every one into the use of it against their will— This advice was not precisely the most palatable that could have been administered, but it was the best that could be given him— My garden has been this year so much neglected that we have not the common vegetables, Peas and Beans— Carrots and Beets; but must purchase them— I spoke of it to Kirk and enjoined upon him better husbandry for the next year.— Young evening party with music of the Piano and songs.

                "text": "16. IV. Wednesday.  Sun rose 5.7. First clear since my return  In my morning excursion to see the rising Sun, I met again Mr Brummett— For morning exercise I waste time in labouring on my seedling trees— Proof daily heaps itself upon proof of how useless these labours are, for want of orderly system, and ultimate purpose— I emptied a seedling pot, and weeded and manured 5 apple stocks in a row at the opening of the seminary gate, where I have proposed to raise, one apple tree that shall stand One of them is now 6. feet 6 inches high with a stem nearly straight to the top. Two others are from 3 to 4 feet high: and two not over 9 inches. All the seeds sown at the same time.— Mr E. Price Greenleaf came this afternoon, and budded 10 seedling stocks in the seminary thicket. 2. Harvest 2 Rohan, 2. Spitzenberg 2. Amory and 2. Rhode-Island sweetings— Also 4 Spitzenberg on Fanny’s row—and 5 in the Orchard. Deacon Spear was here this morning and proposed to me to fix a day when I would go with him into the woods— I told him I would go upon any day convenient to my Son, who is to go with us—and desired to agree upon it with him.— On my return home from Canada, I found among the newspapers on my table one with the title of Boston Investigator—devoted to the protection and development of infidel principles: Vol. 13. No. 13. Wednesday August 2. 1843— It had apparently been sent to me for a scurrilous article on the 2d. page entitled, Another specimen of Christian Criticism; being a knavish commentary upon the Revd. Joseph Emerson’s Letter to me, and my answer respecting the translation of Voltaire’s philosophical Dictionary—imputed to me because the title page announces it as printed and published by J. Q. Adams— The Article now states that it was published in 1836. at the investigator office and purports to be with additional Notes both critical and argumentative by Abner Kneeland— This man was an avowed atheist, and preacher of atheism; of which his translation of Voltaire’s dictionary was one of the gospels— He was shortly after convicted upon an indictment for blasphemy—imprisoned, and soon pardoned. His Atheist church was broken up, but it seems his weekly atheist Newspaper still continues.— Two or three days since I received an Octavo weekly Journal Edited by G. Vale at New-York 5. Augt. Third series Vol. 1. N. 18. The Beacon—seventh year— A co-adjutor of the Boston Investigator in the propagandism of the atheistic church— In this paper there is an Article headed Voltaire and J. Q. Adams, containing my letter of 17. June 1843 to Mr Emerson, with one from him to the Editors of the New-York Observer, requesting them to publish it. The correspondent of the Beacon, extracts them from the Journal of Commerce, without noticing the offensive fraud of palming upon me the act of printing and publishing these excrements of Voltaire but with a malignant imputation of false pretences in my remarks upon the base and filthy infidelity of Voltaire— These periodical publications, the Investigator, and the Beacon indicate the pertinacity, with which this little atheistic club, pursue their will of the wisp over the low, swampy lands of Christendom.

We went in after two, and the landsmen had already dined upon the chowder.— A second table was however got up for us and we fed— After dinner my companions and some others went out for a second fare— I staid and loitered under the shed in conversation with a motley group of 25 or 30 strangers till past 5. when we returned to a tea and evening party of Ladies and Gentlemen at Mr Loring’s, till Charles came and said if I intended to return home this Night it was time to go. We came immediately home; and I received a note from Benjamin’s father; informing him that his mother was dying. "

Among the persons introduced to me yesterday, were two persons from Kentucky named Scott and Andrews, who urgently invited me to visit Louisville next November when I go to Cincinnati, and Mr John B. Flint a Son of the former Minister of Cohasset, heretofore a merchant in Boston, and now an inhabitant of Louisville.— He asked me if I had received a Letter from him written yesterday giving me such an invitation, with one introductory of himself from Dr N. L. Frothingham— I had not received them—but they came this day— Of the company last evening was Mrs Parsons the daughter of my early and long-lamented friend John Thaxter, and Mr and Mrs Wilder daughter of Mrs Parsons. My two Grandsons John Quincy and Charles Francis are now at school in charge of Mr and Mrs Wilder.— A son of Nathan Rice was also of the party; and a Grandson of General Benjamin Lincoln; who told me that he had a considerable collection of Letters from General Washington and of my father to General Lincoln: some of them highly interesting.— Of many of the persons introduced to me, both at the cold spring and in the evening I cannot retain even the names— Mr Smith the preceptor of the Academy and Mrs Smith were there, and the three daughters of Quincy Thaxter himself now deceased—The Revd. Joseph Richardson my immediate predecessor as representative of the Plymouth District in Congress was one of the party at the spring— This morning my Son and William C. Johnson went to Boston, and returned to dine with us as did Isaac Hull Adams, who with the three girls had made a party to Squantum.— I called at the Quincy Patriot Office to enquire if the publisher John A. Green intended to republish my Letter to the Bangor Committee. He had it already marked on the Emancipator for publication next week; together with my Letter to Mr Alden, correcting the errors of the press, published with the Letter in yesterday’s emancipator. I spoke to Mr Green for 100 copies of the Bangor Letter, folded in octavo form, and he promised to send me the proof sheet for revisal next Tuesday or Wednesday. President Quincy was here with Mr George T. Bigelow. They had been attending a meeting of the Directors of Neponset Bridge— I made sundry enquiries of Mr Quincy respecting the erection of the Astronomical Observatory at Cambridge, and the subscription for procuring a telescope of the first class for its use— I want especially the names and purposes of the instruments to be procured—their cost— The time when it is expected they will be received The persons now employed upon astronomical observation and calculation, and what is expected to be the annual cost of the whole establishment— Mr Quincy promised to communicate to me the correspondence on the subject; and inviting me to commencement next week, to shew me the present condition of the building— I fear my own want of perseverance in the pursuit of these enquiries— Afternoon visit from Mr and Mrs Vernon of Kingston Rhode Island— "

But while I have been absent it is overgrown with grass and weeds, upon which I operated this morning partially with the hoe— And I filled a seedling pot with earth from the ditch halfway up the hill for an experiment— The third year English Oak in Mary Louisa’s patch is Sun killed: and another has just come up in the adjoining southerly patch— A person by the name of Mann accosted me this morning while I was at work, and told me that he lived over the brook west of my neighbour G. W. Beale’s, and could supply me with chickens whenever I may want any— My Grandsons John Quincy and Charles Francis Adams came home as usual on Saturdays from school at Mr Wilder’s, Hingham— Coll. Benjamin Loring of Boston with Mr Jo. K. Meredith a young man from Virginia came with a Letter of introduction from Mr Thomas Loring, merely to see me as a curiosity— A party of our double family Isaac H. Adams, William C. Johnson, Fanny Foster. Sarah A. Johnson, and our Mary Louisa Adams, went to Medford to visit Mr and Mrs. John Angier and returned this evening— Mr E Price Greenleaf came this afternoon and budded for me 4. seedling Apple stocks including that in front of my library window with Hingham slips received this morning from Mr Loring and 5 pear stocks. 3 caplimonts and 2 Dix’s. 1 in the Seminary thicket, and 4 in the orchard. I went this evening to the town Hall, and heard an Anti-Slavery Address of about an hour delivered by Wendell Phillips; an intimate friend of my youth was his father John Phillips afterwards the first Mayor of Boston.— I had heard much of Wendell as an Abolitionist enthusiastic Orator, but had never seen or heard him. He was now introduced to me by one equally a stranger to me, but who introduced himself—named J. W. Pendleton. Mr Phillips spoke to me about his fathers intimate acquaintance with me; which I confirmed; and assured him of the respectful and affectionate memory that I retain of him— He said he was so young when his father died that he had but a faint recollection of him; but that a friend of his who had known him had told him if his father had lived to this time, he would not have followed the course which he does— I said I thought that was probable; the great characteristic of his father having been prudence and discretion in the avowal of his opinions—and boldness that of Wendell himself— His address this evening was extemporaneous, and very handsomely delivered— Its topics were censure upon the church for coldness or lukewarmness to the cause of anti-slavery, and a fervid argument for the total and immediate abolition of Slavery throughout the world— Mr Pendleton walked home with me.

                "text": "Sunday. 20. IV.  Rain, nearly all night—and Lightening this morning. Mr Lunt preached this morning from Psalm 91.2 “I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.” Confidence in God— The same subject treated by Dr Frothingham last Sunday Morning, differently, but still well treated by Mr Lunt— He said that in order to judge of the expediency or duty of reposing confidence it was necessary to consider the attributes suited to inspire confidence of the object to be confided in. And these were transcendent in God beyond all else— These attributes were 1. His power—Omnipotence— 2. His wisdom 3. His goodness. 4 His unity. 5. The gift of Revelation— Upon each of these attributes he dilated as separately and in combination sources of confidence— He then alluded to the antient doctrine that the Gods take no interest in human affairs as a great and pernicious error destroying all confidence in God; and he glanced without dwelling upon a modern error equally destructive of confidence in God—the supposed existence of a rival or antagonist power to that of God; sharing with him in the government of the world; defying his power and disabling his goodness and outwitting his wisdom— God he said had no such rival or antagonist. After expatiating upon the inestimable value of this confidence in God to the happiness of man, he reminded his auditory that it was a trust forfeited by Sin, from which whether of commission or of omission it was incubent on every man solicitous for his own comfort and happiness to abstain— No greater calamity could befall a man than to lose his confidence in God— It was the enjoyment and consolation in this life, and the unwavering hope of a blessed immortality— The afternoon text was from Psalm 55—the latter part of verse 19.— [“]Because they have no changes therefore they fear not God.” The tendency of change in human affairs to inspire devotion, and of continuous prosperity to induce presumptuous indifference to the will of God, was connected in the Sermon with the recent death of Mrs. Locke, a young woman of 23. daughter of Josiah Nightingale— Prayers were requested for him and his family; and for the husband Locke— The youngest daughter was also prayed for being weak and low— I made this day a special effort of attention to the two discourses, with barely tolerable success in the morning, but with signal failure from drowsiness in the afternoon.— Buffon considered Genius, as consisting of continuous application— There is something else. But involuntary slumber is a physical and mental infirmity under the operation of which observation and reflection are suspended.— Does Genius ever sleep? I wrote my two pages in the leisure of the day—but I sleep when I would not, and cannot sleep when I would— I seem to myself often an Idler; but I believe I tax my physical nature for toil beyond its endurance— Charles and his wife, W. C. and Sarah A Johnson passed the Evening here. "

I desired him to mention to the nominating committee the special relations which existed between Dr Greenwood and Dr Frothingham, who is now, and has been for months preaching to Dr Greenwood’s congregation—and the obligation of the Society to Dr Frothingham for the use of his church, and for taking a part in the celebration of the 29th. of May. Mr Felt acknowledged the force of the reasons, and promised to report them to the Committee— He also informed me, that the printer of My Discourse was Mr Bolles whose printing Office was over the Bookseller’s shop of Little and Brown in Washington Street. I went there and ordered the 200 copies of my Discourse to be sent to Bigelow stable, Hawley Place where my Carriage was, and it was done. I dined with Mr Winthrop—Miss Winthop and Miss Tappan were there—Mr and Mrs John P. Kennedy. William Minot, Dr. Warren, Dr. Palfrey, and Josiah Quincy junr were there— Miss Winthrop is just engaged to Dr Warren— I came home in a continual flood of rain, alighting at my gate as the darkness of Night was setting in.

After some discussion the subject was referred to the publishing committee for consideration— I entered on the Book of persons proposed for membership the name of Dr. Nathaniel L Frothingham, to succeed Dr Greenwood— But the nomination is to be made by a standing Committee— Adjourned, just about 1. judge Davis invited me to dine with him next Tuesday, which I accepted— Mr Winthrop invited me to dine with him at half past two— I had an hour and a half on hand and two objects to secure— One to communicate to the publishing Committee the special reasons for electing Dr Frothingham in the place of Dr Greenwood— The other to get from the printer 200 copies of my Discourse on the New-England confederacy of 1643.— I walked to Mr Felts and found him at dinner. I desired him to mention to the nominating committee the special relations which existed between Dr Greenwood and Dr Frothingham, who is now, and has been for months preaching to Dr Greenwood’s congregation—and the obligation of the Society to Dr Frothingham for the use of his church, and for taking a part in the celebration of the 29th. of May. Mr Felt acknowledged the force of the reasons, and promised to report them to the Committee— He also informed me, that the printer of My Discourse was Mr Bolles whose printing Office was over the Bookseller’s shop of Little and Brown in Washington Street. I went there and ordered the 200 copies of my Discourse to be sent to Bigelow stable, Hawley Place where my Carriage was, and it was done. I dined with Mr Winthrop—Miss Winthop and Miss Tappan were there—Mr and Mrs John P. Kennedy. William Minot, Dr. Warren, Dr. Palfrey, and Josiah Quincy junr were there— Miss Winthrop is just engaged to Dr Warren— I came home in a continual flood of rain, alighting at my gate as the darkness of Night was setting in.

Friday  Last evening soon after my return home, Mr Marchant a painter from New-York called on me, and enquired if I had received a Letter from a Committee of the New-York historical Society, requesting me to sit to him for my picture. I said I had; but that having been immediately afterwards been absent from home a month, and under some uncertainty whether it was the wish of the Committee that Mr Marchant should come here to paint the portrait, or wait till my passage through New-York, I had hitherto delayed answering their Letter. He said he had now come to take the time that might suit my convenience for the work— Mr Marchant had already painted my portrait in November 1840. at New-York— But as I could then give him only three sittings in two days, he was not satisfied with his own work, and wishes to do it over again— He had now with him a miniature copied from his former picture, but our Ladies thought it bore No resemblance to me. Mr Marchant is at present engaged in painting certain portraits at Providence, and will come the week after next to take mine— This morning I made my morning excursion for observation and exercise but saw not the rising Sun intercepted as he was by a dense fog— But upon inspecting the self planted seedling wild cherry on the hill, I saw a white knob, thrusting itself up through the surface of the horse manure that I had gathered round the tree— It has put forth three or four plumelet leaves, while I was absent on my journey. So have many of the English Oaks— Mr Samuel Lewis of Cincinnati Ohio brother brought me a Letter of introduction from Mr Joshua Leavitt— Mr Lewis was formerly the Superintendent of common schools in the State of Ohio, and is an abolitionist— He expressed high gratification, at my engagement to visit Cincinnati next November— I conversed freely with him upon the subject of Slavery, but told him that I shall probably feel myself interdicted from discoursing or perhaps even speaking about it at Cincinnati— I received a Letter from Philadelphia signed Joseph Hedges, covering a sealed Letter, not directed, and requesting me to forward it to Daniel Webster—alledging that it is on business and that the writer does not know Mr Webster’s Post Office address— Without directing the Letter I enclosed it to him at Marshfield. Mrs John and Mrs Charles F. Adams with their two daughters and Sarah A Johnson visited Boston this afternoon; took tea with Mrs Frothingham, and returned— My Son and William C. Johnson came home the evening of Commencement day, and yesterday morning took the Steamer took the Barnstable; to pass through Sandwich to Wood’s hole, and thence to New Bedford— On visiting again this evening the wild cherry seedling on the hill, I found the fungus mushroom or toadstool with its dark cap opened like an umbrella over a white stem four inches long.— I am not yet recovered from four successive days of dissipation.

I commenced this morning my operations with the spade, experimental for health and for cultivation— Filled seedling Pot N. 1. with earth from the ditch, enriched and planted in it 12 cherry stones— The Quincy Patriot of this day has my Letter to the Bangor Committee correctly printed— I received yesterday a Letter signed Samuel M Pond President, with 2 Secretaries dated Portland 22. August. and containing a vote of thanks to me for that Letter, from a meeting of the friends of universal Liberty in the State of Maine— Mr N. E. Johnson is the Editor of the New-York Evangelist a weekly religious public journal somewhat inclined to abolitionism— He was at the late Liberty meeting in Portland— Mr Whiton has some connection with the Anti-Slavery press in Boston, but I know not exactly how— Mr Quincy Thaxter was here this afternoon with his son a boy of 5 years old named John Quincy and with his Sister Anna Thaxter— She came to invite my wife and our Ladies to a tea and evening party at Hingham; but my wife is again so ill that she has taken to her bed; and none of the other Ladies incline to go without her— Mr Thaxter in right of his wife has a claim for a portion of the Estate of William Otis, and brought with him sundry documents recently received from the Island of Cuba, in the Spanish language, taken to authenticate the genealogy of Mrs Thaxter in descent from Nathaniel Otis one of the brothers of William— I offered him any services in my power to recover his claim and he left all his papers with me to be presented to Mr Lewis Johnson the Administrator of William Otis, when I go next to Washington. Charles’s two boys came home from Hingham— At Sunset I walked up the hill to Charles’s house but was belated for seeing the Sunset.— As I passed by the seedling wild cherry I saw that the mushrooms or toadstool had shot up its stem till it became top heavy, broke down and turned black as a sooty chimney— Mr Edward Brooks junr came out from Boston to take tea with Mrs Charles, and I went to the town hall, and heard Wendell Phillips deliver a second Anti-Slavery Address.— He spoke without Notes, as all the Lecturers now do— His argument was the incumbent duty of every abolitionist is to trample under foot the article of the Constitution which requires the surrender of fugitive Slaves.— He assumes the position that this is null and void; as a compact contrary to the Law of Nature and of God— He thanked God that he was not a citizen of the United States—and goes the extremest lengths of the abolitionists— After his lecture he came and spoke to me, and . . . I told him I could not concur in his doctrines— He took me home in his Carry all.— His auditory was small. "

                "text": "27. III.30 Sunday— Saw Sirius—risen at 4.  Mr Motte was a Classmate and chamber mate of my dear and lamented son George— He is a native of South-Carolina, born of Episcopalian parents; educated at Cambridge, and afterwards for an Episcopalian clergyman— His studies led him to the unitarian faith, and the congregational forms— He was for a year or two Minister of the unitarian church at Washington; and afterwards of the South Congregation, Washington Street, Boston— His talents are respectable, and his life and conversation blameless.— But his defect of character is want of energy— He travelled a year or two in Europe with the consent of his congregation for the restoration of his health, and returned to them again— But his manner of preaching is not attractive— It is languid and lifeless, and the substance of his discourses, though sensible and intelligent has no charm to redeem the dulness of a languid and listless delivery.— His congregation insensibly grew weary of his ministrations hardly knowing why— They drop’d off one by one from his Society— Those who remained became uneasy and discontented, till by mutual consent they agreed to part. He took his dismission in kindness and charity, and they elected in his place a young man named Huntington, at whose ordination I assisted last October.— Mr Motte continues to preach as occasion calls, and has now a summer residence at Cohasset— His Sermon this morning was from 1. Corinthians 15.45. [“]And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. 46. Howbeit, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual 47. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. 48. As is the earthy, such are the earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also, that are heavenly.” Here is a multifold repetition of one idea—the distinction between matter and spirit; but Mr Motte made it the foundation of an enquiry into the nature of the enjoyments of Paradise, and why there is so much lamentation at their having been forfeited— Mr Motte dined with us, and his afternoon Sermon was from 2. Corinthians 4.18. [“]While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.” substantially the same subject as that of the morning.— And I found it impossible to follow the preacher into any train of impressive argument. The day was to the feelings the hottest of the season—Sultry and scorching. Towards sunset there came up a long though not very severe thunder shower— This evening I completed the recovery of the 12 days of arrears which had accumulated in my diary, in the month of my journey to Canada and the Falls of Niagara and of Trenton.

Spading one hour— Loosened the ground round the Apple seedling in front of my Library window— Deacon Spear was here to speak of the payment of my annual tax-bill—Town and County— A deduction of 4 per cent for payment on or before the first of September— My Son has the bill— We expected his return home this day; but he did not arrive— Captain Josiah Bass’s Son has four lots of woodland 50 acres in all, which he wants to sell, but names no asking price. I required that the precise quantity of the land should be ascertained, and the price specified—after which I promised to go and look at the lots.— Mrs. Martha is the widow of Lemuel Burrell, a Seaman on board the Macedonian frigate, and died in the service at Norfolk, Virginia— She has received the widow’s pension 5 years 72 dollars a year; but it was stop’d last January when she received 12 dollars as a final payment— She is in great want of a renewal of the pension, and desires to petition Congress for it. I advised her to petition jointly with as many other widows having the same ground of claim as her own, as she could find out, and I promised to present the petition and give it all the support in my power. She is a daughter of Joseph Beale heretofore of Squantum, and lives now with her daughter, wife of Richard Newcomb of this town— Mr Peirce Perkins professor of Astronomer at Harvard University, and Mr Bond, Observer for the observatory, which is to be came from Cambridge and dined with me— Mr Bond brought with him some papers additional to those which President Quincy had sent me— The successors of Frauenhofer at Munich are Merz an Optician, and Mahler a Mechanician— The price of the duplicate of the Pulkova Telescope is 42000 German florins, or 16800 dollars— On their Catalogue for sale there is a graduation of the prices of Refractors of inferior power—of 30,000. 22000. 15000— 8000. 4800. 2200. 2000 1500. 900. and 750 florins— And a multitude of other mathematical and optical instruments the most costly of which is the Heliometer charged at 15000 florins. Of this there is one at Pulkova— The mural circle is the next dearest astronomical instrument, after the Refractor. Its chief use is for making catalogues of Stars, and it requires two observers to be constantly occupied at the same time— They do not propose to procure at present a mural circle, or to make that Class of Observations at Cambridge— The Perkins professorship of Astronomy and Mathematics is a new institution at Harvard, and Mr Peirce has been this year appointed the first professor.— Mr Bond left with me two pamphlets—one in French F G. G. Struve’s report of his observations of double Stars, with Frauenhofer’s great Telescope at Dorpat from 1824 to 1837. Struve being then Director of the Dorpat Observatory.— The other is an Additamentum, in Latin, dated 2. Octr. 1839. when Struve had been transferred to the new Observatory at Pulkova; and with which there is appended a disquisition on the annual parallax of the Star [symbols] Lyrae— I collected from this interview much desultory information which I must tax my memory to retain, but which I cannot record. I took them up to Charles’s house to shew them the prospect— Met there Mr and Mrs Edmund Quincy on a visit from Dedham— Edward Brooks junr. and Thomas Frothingham came out afterwards and spent the Evening with us.

Spading and hoeing 2. hours— The Pear tree first bearing in the centre of the garden next the red cherry tree, is a bergamot— I took up the diseased peach tree close to the fence at the kitchen garden gate— In attempting to trim the wild cherry seedling up the hill, I cut off the stem itself close to the ground.— Broke up the ground sloping down from the tool box towards the orchard— Deacon Spear was here again enquiring for my Son, and about paying to Lewis Bass, collector of the town and County tax, to-morrow to save the deduction of 4 per cent for prompt payment. My Son had not then returned from his excursion, with William C. Johnson to Barnstable, Provincetown, Sandwich, Wood’s hole, Nantucket and New-Bedford— But they got home before dinner, and were here this evening.— President Quincy called on me and said he had been to the grave yard to see to the repairing of his monument of his father and mother— It has been erected about 40 years, and I wrote the epitaph engraved upon it. It is already dilapidated, in consequence of its exposure to Sun, rain, frost snow and mischievous boys— The cemetery has been much neglected, but more care of it is now taken— Mr Daniel Greenleaf called in and said that the tomb of the Ministers of the parish had been opened to deposit there the remains of the late Pastor Peter Whitney, who died on thelast and that the coffin of Norton Quincy was there placed on that of Anthony Wibird the immediate predecessor of Peter Whitney— But there was no inscription on the Stone of the name of either. That of Mr Wibird was now to be carved on it, and Mr Greenleaf enquired if I should wish to have that of Norton Quincy added to it. I said I should; and requested Mr Greenleaf to say to Mr Lunt that I would see him on the subject. I had further conversation with Mr Quincy concerning the observatory, and he is to send me some other papers accidentally omitted when he sent me the others— I read the french pamphlet report of Struve to the Minister of public instruction and President of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences Ouvaroff, containing the narrative of his observations upon double stars at Dorpat from 1824 to 1837. It is full of very interesting information, leading as usual to multitudes of further enquiries which I shall never have time to pursure—for see now the distribution of my time, through this month of August since the 5th. when I came home.

Sudden change of weather last Evening from sultry dog day heat with swarms numberless of musquitos to a chilling Northeaster— Spading and hoeing two hours— The English acorns planted last October continue to come up from the ground one after another so late in the Season that the stems cannot acquire a consistency to survive the winter without protection from the frost. Summer and winter are equally fatal to them— And for this I should discover a remedy.— A man by the name of Butters came as a mendicant with a recommendatory Letter from Mr Ripley the minister of Waltham. His apology for beggary was that he had lost his property and must raise 150 dollars to recover it. He said he had got nearly the whole, but wanted a few dollars more and enumerated sundry of my friends who had given him 5 dollars each. I thought one quite as much as he deserved— George W. Hardwick brought honey in the comb for sale 25 cents a pound.— Charles and W. C. Johnson went to Boston and dined at Dr Frothingham’s— Mrs Charles, and the three girls went also, and got home just in time to hear the 9 O’Clock bell— I called this evening on Mr Lunt the minister and spoke with him of the inscription to be made on the ministerial monument of the name of Norton Quincy, who was buried in it— He promised to attend to it— Struve’s report on double stars was published by order of the Russian Academy of Sciences says that stars of the 6th. magnitude can be seen with the naked eye, and none below the 12th magnitude can be seen by the most powerful Telescope— The bright star of Lyra, Vega is a double star and Struve observed its annual parallax— There are two classes of double stars, optical, one behind the other, and physical—stars composing a solar system with Satellites— The observation of the double stars give by their changing distances furnish the means of ascertaing the parallax of the brightest of the two Stars— Herschel in 1780 and 1800 was the first of double stars in 1813 Struve began the observation of them at Dorpat— In 1824. The great Telescope, the masterpiece of Frauenhofer was received and from that day the observatory of Dorpat took the lead of all others for the observation of double stars. The multitude of observations is almost as surprizing as that of the Stars. There are only 120 nights in the year when observations can and only 80 when the micrometrical observations can be pursued with large magnifying powers.— With a magnifying power of 1000. the 100th. part of a second is a discernable quantity— The Mira Ceti or whale wonder changes from a Star of being of the 2d. magnitude till is diminished till it disappears— There are stars of all the colours of the rainbow— There are triple and quadruple stars— The distance of stars of the 6th. magnitude is estimated at 16 millions of times the distance of the earth from the Sun.

Kirk and Dennis broke up and manured most of the seminary plats which I had not cleared out— Mr Lunt called on me to enquire of the time of the birth of Norton Quincy of which I had told him I thought I had a record; but on making search I found it not, though I had of his marriage in 1746. Mr. Lunt spoke also of his design to prepare and deliver a course of Lectures upon English Literature; and supposing I was one of the directors of the Lowell Institute intimated a wish that I would propose him as a candidate for the appointment, to deliver his course there—and asked for the use of books in my library which he may want in the prosecution of his work—which I very cheerfully promised—as well as to do any thing else in my power to serve him; though I have no connection with the Lowell Institute— I saw the Sun set from Charles’s porch— I made up a parcel of 25 of my printed miscellanies and gave them to my brother Charles’s grandson—William C. Johnson and gave him two others for his brother Alexander to whom I had promised my argument in the case of the Amistad captives.— The search for scattered pamphlets and other nameless absorptions of time stole away my morning hours—and dinner came before my record of yesterday was completed. After dinner the labour of writing is too drowsy, and my tribute to the address for Cincinnati was of only one page— Mr Beale was here this Evening. I received a Letter from President Quincy, enclosing sundry Letters from Astronomical observators to Joseph Cranch, London, and one from him to Professor Peirce, all written in 1842. and relating to Astronomical Instruments and their makers.— Of these more hereafter  Struve.  His catalogue of double stars, discovered by the great Telescope of Frauenhofer in the space of 2 1/2 years 120000 stars of magnitude from the first to the 8th and a little beyond; of which 3112 were physical double—and of these only 340 were on the list of Herschel and 447 on a former catalogue of Struve, before Frauenhofer’s great refractor was made. Struve considers the double Stars as Solar systems with planetary Satellites like those of our own Sun— The relative movements of these double stars are ascertained, and he gives a list of 7. whose periods of revolution in their orbits are from 43 to 573 years— The deepest impression left on my mind by these observations of Struve is the immense increase of visual power conferred upon mankind by the invention of these new instruments, which may be called Titanic Telescopes.

Discovered a swarm of black oak caterpillar worms clinging round two twigs of the 13 years old shagbark walnut tree at the bottom of the Nursery. Cut off the twigs and consigned their occupants to the fire. Heard Mr Lunt this morning from the Genesis 49.4. “Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.” This was an admirable discourse, on stability of character— The sentiment thus expressed in the English Bible is incomparable as a maxim of morals, but is not a correct translation of the original. Charles Thomson’s translation from the Septuagint, mutilates the thought, and substitutes little better than nonsense in its place— Mr Lunt began by relating the occasion upon which the words were spoken, by Israel on his dying bed, in what is called his blessing upon his children.— It is rather the prediction of the future fortunes of their descendants— The lot of Reuben the first born was any thing but a blessing— It is reproach for more than instability. It is a charge of criminality and a declaration that its punishment shall be visited on the descendents of Reuben by the forfeiture of his right of primogeniture. Mr Lunt merely glanced at this view of the subject— His Sermon was a comment upon the sentiment that instability of character is fatal to all excellence.— He pointed to the sources of stability the consciencious estimate of right, and religious faith— I believe that a loose faith is the surest indication of wavering integrity, and can have no confidence in the honesty of a philosophical unbeliever— Immediately after my returning from the morning meeting, Mr Degrand came in from Boston—dined with us, and kept me in attendance till 10. in the evening. Mr Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from John 15.5. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing— The argument of this discourse was that the Christian religion is addressed more to the heart than to the head— That it deals little in abstractions—that it personifies all the virtues, and that all its efficacy depends upon the personal character of Jesus Christ, without whom his disciples can do nothing.— He incidentally gave a side blow to the transcendental doctrines of Ralph Waldo Emerson and the scarcely disguised infidelity of Theodore Parker, which is shaking the faith of the sons of the New-England Pilgrims— It had been advertised in the Quincy Patriot of yesterday that Edmund Quincy woul deliver a Lecture upon Slavy in the town Hall at half past five O’Clock this afternoon— I went with De Grand and found that his wife, and their Son Edmund, a boy of 5 years old were with him. I invited them all to take tea with me after the Lecture which they did. The Lecture delivered without notes was about an hour and half long and very reproachfull. The auditory about double the numbers of those at the Lectures of W. Phillips. "

Heavy dew and wet feet— Two hours— Planted in seedling pot N. 2. 12 mazzard cherry-stones— Mushrooms coming up in abundance— Mrs Kirk has raised double flowered Althaea’s, from slips which she brought from Washington the winter before last. Some of the flowers are now in bloom— She says an Apple tree slip which she stuck into the ground has taken root— My Son, his wife and daughter Louisa Catherine, Mrs John Adams and her daughter Mary Louisa; with William C. Johnson and his sister Sarah, made a party and went to Medford and dined at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s. Charles and William returned soon after dark, but it was past 9 when the Ladies reached home— Charles’s three elder sons dined with us— The day was excessively warm and sultry, which partially disabled me for writing on my astronomical address, and I expended three hours in a search for papers which I did not find— I read the first book of Bailly’s history of antient astronomy, and Charles brought me from Boston the Number of the North American Review for April 1825. containing the Article of Dr Bowditch upon modern Astronomy.— Bailly fixes on the year 3890. before Christ for the invention of the sphere by Atlas, and marks that period as the commencement of the study of Astronomy.— In the Atlantic Nation. He considers Uranus as of the same nation—and that Fohi in China, Thaut or Mercury in Egypt—Zoroaster and Belus in Persia and Babylonia cultivated the science about the same time— He gives for the duration of the globe to the Christian Aera,  The Persians, preceding the Chaldeans instituted the canicular year of 1441 years 3209 years before Christ.  The Chinese have the record of an eclipse 2155 years before Christ—2500 years before Christ occurred the conjunction of the 5 planets on the day of the new moon. A minister of Hoang-ti named Yu-Chi discovered the pole-star and made something like an Orrery, and Fo-hi himself was an eminent Astronomer— Made a Zodiac and constructed Astronomical tables— Fohi flourished 2952 years before Christ— Bailly says he believes that these facts cannot be false— The tartars have the same pretension and extend to the same period— But neither Fohi nor Uranus nor Atlas was the inventor of Astronomy They received it from the Atlantic Nation— The Chaldean Saros of 223 lunar months and the luni solar period of 600 years came from that people— The invention of the Zodiac must have preceded the deluge— Astronomy was cultivated 1500 years before the flood, and is now upwards of 7000 years old— "

Devoured all night by muschitos, and compelled to rise before my time to escape from them— The loss of the Night’s repose infected the industry of the day and the astronomical address lingers mournfully along— I filled experimentally the seedling pot N. 3. and spaded round the Apple tree by the side of which the seedling white maple perished in the drought. I took to the Book binder Gill the 17th volum of my Diary, from 1. Jany. 1842 to 8. July 1843 to be bound. The old Mitchell’s map was there and I left directed how it was to be repaired for preservation. I met sundry boys gathering wild cherries from my trees along the road on the hill— They said they had permission— Harvey Field was here, renewing proposals for the purchase of lands from my Penn’s valley farm, but shy of making offers. I desired him to stake out the ground which he wanted, with Deacon Spear, and to name the price he is willing to give for it; and promised then an answer— I received a Letter from Mr Frye, with enquiries whether of Mr T. B. Johnson’s funds of which my Son is the Agent and Trustee the sum of 3500 dollars can be withdrawn to be invested in a mortgage of George Boyd’s house and land in Michigan to save his wife and children from being turned houseless into the Street or the woods— I took the letter to my Son and had some conversation with him about it.— He finally took the Letter, and said he would answer it— Mr Lunt was here this Evening. He has been to Hingham, and through Mr Jairus Lincoln obtained the following extracts, from the town records of that place John Quincy of Braintree and Elizabeth Norton of Hingham were married October 6. 1715.— Norton Quincy was born Oct 27. 1716. This supplies the dates of two events which I have long been desirous of ascertaining— The entry in chief Justice Sewall’s Diary of 5 pounds lent to John Quincy, with the present of a Psalm book for his mistress is of Octr. 4. 1715. as now appears only two days before his marriage— I am daily receiving Letters of invitation to visit places on going to or returning from Cincinnati which embarrass me exceedingly. This day two from Samson Mason and one from H. Hedrick to Springfield, Clark County Ohio.— One two days since from Joshua R. Giddings, apprizing me that they are taking measures to invite me to Jefferson, Ashtabula County, Ohio. Besides the invitation already received from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—there has been a meeting of the inhabitants without distinction of party and Resolutions adopted to invite me as the guest of the city— I have received also Letters from Mrs Alicia Boylston, Elisha H. Allen, James T. Austin, Caleb Hartshorn—James Eaton of Malden, (to deliver a Lecture) and Frederick T. Tiffany (to be re-elected chaplain of the U.S. house of Representatives) requiring immediate answers, which I procrastinate— I made out to write this Evening to Mr Joseph Grinnell, enclosing to him the 5 dollars bank Bill, received from General Peter B. Porter at Niagara Falls for him. "

Work about my grounds—gathered a quart of wild cherries from the seedling tree opposite the kitchen window in the garden, and steeped them in three bottles of New England Rum. At 8 O’Clock Deacon Spear came and I went with him and my Son, in my own Carry all to visit my grounds on the Penn’s valley farm— I stop’d to see my kinsman Josiah Adams, four score years of age, and now for the last nine months paralytic and bed-ridden— His brothers Ebenezer and Thomas have gone before him, and he lingers along, a few days more— I found since I was last at his houseyears ago a road laid out from just before his house, to the house that was my brother’s in Braintree, and it runs through my lots between my native spot and the lawyer’s common so that I know the places no longer. Since the death of Ebenezer Adams, Daniel Baxter junr. has purchased at auction for 45 dollars an acre, the lot that belonged to the 2 brothers. 16 Acres, between my Druid lot and lawyers common has changed the face of it by Tillage, and now proposes to buy 8 acres of mine or to sell me his 16 acres at 75 dollars an acre— My land borders on the road: his lies back, which shews his astuteness in the proposal to give or take— We made our way through a narrow and tangled path across the lawyer’s common; where in 1829 I sold off the burden of Pine and hemlock wood, and which is now thickly covered with a growth of black, white, and scrub oaks, with a portion of white birch, white and pitch pine and sundry others— From the South side of lawyer’s common I walked with my Son round by Capen’s house to the new road where Deacon Spear met us with the horse and carryall which he had gone back to fetch— Here we met Daniel Baxter junr. and Mr Totman all wanting to purchase parcels of my land bordering upon the road, but shy of offering any specific price for what they want except Mr Baxter’s offer like the exchange of shields between Diomed and Glaucus. I told them all I must take time for consideration. I returned home with Charles, and at two O’Clock William C and Sarah A. Johnson left us, went into Boston, and took the Cars of the Western Railroad to Utica— Mrs. Charles with her baby Arthur to see and consult Dr. Bigelow. Mary Louisa, and Louisa Catherine went to Boston with them and saw them off— Then came back about Sunset— We shall miss William and Sarah very much— Before Sarah went away, she asked me for some lines to enter upon her Album; and I gave her two Stanza’s upon smiles.— I sent the Letter to Mr Grinnell of New-Bedford, and answered the Letter from Mr James T. Austin requesting an introductory Letter to Europe— I have no familiar acquaintance there. These avocations arrest almost entirely the progress of my astronomical address, for which I find no leisure either to read or to write. "

Planted a row of cherry stones across the centre of the Summerhouse. Mr John Woods of Hamilton Ohio about 20 miles west of Cincinnati, a member of Congress from 1825 to 1829. came with a recommendatory Letter from Mr Corwin to Governor John Davis, which he shewed me— There is a great water power in the town of Hamilton, and Mr Woods has visited the manufactures at Lowell with a view to ascertain the most effective means of managing water power for the establishment of manufacturing mills. He is a member of a company formed there for the purpose of prosecuting this undertaking and is now about to return home— He wrote here and left with me a Letter stating that he had been requested by the Citizens of Hamilton and Roseville, Butler County, Ohio to invite me to visit them on my tour through the State, which invitation I accepted if it may be in my power— The State of Ohio is in the hands of the most unbridled democracy— My promise to go to Cincinnati was rash, and unadvised and has already involved me in engagements to visit places where I shall not be welcome— And my arrears of correspondence with the preparation of an Address oppress me to distraction— The Letters lent me by President Quincy are 1. from Joseph Cranch 30. Rosoman St. Clerkenwell London on Septr 2. 1842 to Professor Benjamin Peirce, Cambridge—with enclosures from J. Challis Professor at the Cambridge Observatory: Mr Brisbane at Greenock. S. Henderson, Observatory at Edinburgh. G. B. Airy, Astronomer Royal at Greenwich two. T. R. Robinson, Armagh and J. F. W. Herschel, Collingwood, all eminent astronomical observers. The Letters are all advisory, and inclining to have the object glass and perhaps the mounting done at Munich— The proposals of Troughton and Simms to construct an equatorial for £1250 Sterling. Other Letters are from George Merz opticus 30 June 1842 and 19 June 1843 from Professor Airy 30 June 1843. speaking of a plan of the Pulkova observatory in the Astronomische Nachrichten of Schumacher N. 290 and mentioning the doubts of the durability of the famous German glass— There is a Letter from Le Rebours at Paris the mathematical instrument maker proposing to construct an equatorial 9000 francs— Merz says that a parallactically mounted Refractor is good only at the place for which it is made, and cannot without great modifications be used elsewhere— He claims payment of one third of the price in advance— The instruments bespoken for the Washington Observatory are a Pulkova Titanic equatorial—of 16 feet focus and 12 inch object glass— 2. A transit for the Meridian 7 feet focus. Another for the prime vertical to be made by Repsold at Hamburg 4. a five feet mural circle 5 a 3 feet transit circle,—and a set of magnetic and meteorological instruments— Cambridge is to have only the Titanic.

Second quart of wild cherries from the young garden seedling steeped in New England Rum— I received this morning Letters 1. From James J. Lawn and 4 others a Committee of the Mechanics Lyceum of Baltimore, inviting me to deliver a Lecture there next Autumn in going to, or returning from Cincinnati. 2. from William G. Webster son of the late Noah Webster. New-York 6. Septr. 1843. proposing that Congress should purchase a manuscript etymological synopsis of his father’s Dictionary, and requesting me to make the application to Congress for the family. 3. from F. C. Hells Septr. 2. 1843. Augusta, Georgia, kindly dissuading me from presenting abolition petitions. 4— From William F. Channing, son of the late Dr. William Ellery Channing, Newport 6 Septr. 1843. asking for any Letters I have received from him, and any other assistance that I can give him in collecting his fathers works for publication and a memoir of his life. 5. From H. F. North—New Britain Connecticut 4. Septr. 1843. for an autograph. 6. From Emily Rushbrook Lewis. 26 Augt. Rock Mills South Carolina, for an Autograph—and 7. from Belinda Anderson 30. August 1843. Union, Erie County Pennsylvania, enclosing complimentary Stanzas in blank verse, and asking for an autograph— All these Letters ought to be answered speedily, and I have made a note of them to see how any of them I shall or can answer at all— I did answer a Letter from Elisha H. Allen of Bangor, Maine, which I intended to do in three lines, and which like a creeping plant spread out into three pages.— I find it easier to write a long Letter than a short one— I answered also a Letter from William F. Lockwood the Editor of a newspaper in Elyria, Ohio— William Jagger visited me this afternoon, and occupied full two hours of my time.— He is still meddling with politics, beyond his depth; but he says that he recovered a verdict upon the libel suit brought against him, and proved by the testimony of judge Anderson, of Virginia that Tom Benton stole money at chapel hill of at least 3 persons besides himself. Deacon Spear came here yesterday with a message from Harvey Field—who wants 32 acres of it and thinks that 5000 dollars would be an adequate price for it— My time is so absorbed by daily avocations that for several days past I have been able to write only one page a day of the address: and even to do that I am obliged to write from ten in the Evening to near Midnight. I was shocked to see in a newspaper of this day an account of the death of Graham H. Chapin one of the Committee who brought me the invitation from Rochester to Buffalo— "

Allen, about his votes on my trial in 1842 and to Caleb Hartshorn thanking him for a copy of the Life and Speeches of Henry Clay by Daniel Mallory, in two Volumes recently published— I received this morning four extra newspapers. 1. The Philanthropist of 30. August 1843. Cincinnati 2. The Herkimer Journal of 6. Septr. 3. Albany weekly Patriot of 5 Septr. all containing my Letter to the Bangor Committee; and 4. The Christian world of this day, with an account of Lewis Tappans late visit to England, with frequent references to me, and particularly the statement that Mr Tappan told Lord Aberdeen, that I had less confidence in the present British administration, with regard to Slavery and the Slave trade than in their predecessors. Lord Aberdeen vehemently disclaimed all diminution of zeal against Slavery and the Slave trade; but Mr Leavitt has come home convinced that my distrust of the present British Minsters is well founded.— William Jagger came again this morning to enquire for a public document relating to the amount and value of the public Lands— I made a search of at least half an hour for Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury in 1841. I found and lent it to Mr Jagger; but he sent it back to me in the course of an hour. The time I lose in searching for papers, and in enduring idle and unwelcome visitors is consuming— That of drowsy exhaustion and worn out lassitude is equally distressing. This afternoon there came a man by the name of Jonathan Underwood, an inhabitant of Parma, Monroe County, New-York about 20 miles from Rochester— He is traveling about the country for his amusement and called to see me out of mere curiosity having missed of seeing me, when I was lately at Rochester— I sat with sad civility, but he kept me two full hours, plying me with questions about men and things chiefly on politics, and to which I answered by little more than monosyllables. Mr Thomas Loring called to apologize for delaying the summons for a second fishing party from Cohasset, which he had promised. His engagements have absorbed his time— He spoke of someday next week, but I desired him not to give himself any trouble or inconvenience, not being overburdened with leisure, myself for the party— I had a long conversation with my Son—urging him to undertake the improvement of my Lands in Quincy by farming, and by preparing the location for house lots— I have neither time, knowledge nor sagacity for the undertaking myself.— I made out a list of the members in the Legislature of the Commonwealth from all the towns of the present eighth Congressional district, and also of the 13 towns in the County of Plymouth, which were of the 12th. Congressional District, under the census of 1830. and are not in the District for which I have now been elected—and I took from my son a minute of the political complection of them all. He and his wife were here an hour this evening. I was again up till midnight writing a page of my address. "

                "text": "10. IV.15 Sunday. Sun rose 5.34. clear.  Mr Lunt preached this morning from Mark 10.15. “Verily I say unto you, whatsoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.”— The affectionate attachment of Jesus Christ to little children is one of the peculiar characteristics of the Christian religion— A century later the Roman Poet Juvenal had said maxima debetur puero reverentia, and that noble sentiment like many others of the same poet, betoken the silent influence of Christianity spreading over the heart of man, while it was yet proscribed and persecuted by the Roman Emperors— The Affection for children was a part of that doctrine of universal benevolence which pervades the new Testament, and which is ever one and the same— It is remarkable that Christ gave no instructions to children— His apostles taught them nothing but obedience to their parents and guardians, and the parable of the prodigal son teaches only to the parent the lesson of forgiveness for transgression— The virtues of children are docility, simplicity, credulity, and sensibility to kindness— This he says is precisely the temper in which the gospel must be received or it cannot be received at all.— He took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them and blessed them— There was more teaching in that action than there would have been in a volume of discourse— Mr Lunt’s Sermon was eloquent and pathetic; but for the last two Nights, between three and four hours of sleep each night have been my portion— Scattered Spirits, dull and slow conceptions flagging attention and a torpid state of body sinking unconsciously into slumber; follow me through the day, and steep my senses in forgetfulness. These are the decays of nature, and are continual admonitions to prepare myself for the time at hand. Mr Samuel K Lothrop Minister of the Brattle Street Church in Boston preached this afternoon; from John 16.32. last part of the verse: “and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me[”]— Mr Lothrop’s manner is in perfect contrast with that of Mr Lunt, and yet is very pleasing. He began by remarking that there is among the generality of mankind a decided aversion to being left alone—and then he descanted upon the peculiar inconveniences of being left alone— Some of the views which he presented of this thought were striking— He referred to the desertion of Jesus by all his disciples, and to the awful but all sufficient consolation and support which he derived from the consciousness that his father was with him—and he solemnly exhorted his hearers to remember that the same trial may await themselves; and they must be prepared to meet it alone, but having the father with them— Mr. and Mrs G. T. Bigelow and Charles Miller were here after Church, and Mrs Phineas Foster towards Evening. "

My morning labours, for the first time this Season were irksome—third quart of wild cherries from the garden seedling to steep in rum. Planted 18. Bergamot pairs in a row, in the small nursery at the northern corner of the garden, and a row of steeped mazzard cherries in the Summer house cellar— Of the seedling Apple stocks transplanted from the Nursery to the orchard there are several flourishing and deserving attention which I have neglected— The seedling English White Oaks, self planted under the trees, are so numerous that all question of their reproduction is removed; and now remains only to devise expedients for saving them and the shagbarks from the winter frost— Harvey Field was here and spoke of that portion of my land which he proposes to purchase; but we cannot agree upon the terms— He offers me five thousand dollars for 32 acres for which I ask 20000— He proposed to sell me his dwelling house and about 20 acres for 10000 dollars, and I told him I would bargain with him if I knew where to find the money to pay for the purchase— Mr Andrew Ernst of Cincinnati, Ohio, paid me a visit with his wife, a daughter of George A. Otis of Boston— Mr Ernst is by birth a German, but came to this Country, a child, more than 40 years since— He says that when his father settled at Cincinnati there were but three houses in the place; it is now a city with 60000 inhabitants— He speaks our language so entirely like the people of our Western section, that not withstanding his name I had not a suspicion that he was born a foreigner, till his wife mentioned it— There was an earnestness and warmth in his manifestations of kindness to me which is never shown by natives of my own Country— There is a consciousness of equality and often of superiority, which interdicts all appearance of obsequiousness in our native Americans, even when they come as beggars— Mr Ernst asked to visit my garden and nursery, and took some nuts, acorns and flower seeds, because they grew in my garden— And he and his wife both invited me to stay at their house when I come to Cincinnati— My time is frightfully shortening to make my preparations for that journey. I answered Mr W. G. Webster’s Letter, and offered to present his memorial asking Congress to purchase the Synopsis of his fathers great dictionary, if he concludes to send it— I intend if possible to write one Letter every day for the next six weeks. But in preparing my astronomical discourse I am much distressed for want of time to read with attention Bailly’s history of antient Astronomy; and Goguets chapters on the same Science— I want 6 months for Bailly’s book alone— In the history of Grecian Astronomy I find the names of Thales Anaximander and Anaximenes all of Miletus— I look for them in the Dictionnaire Historique and find accounts of them, worthy of meditation. Thales was the first of the wise men of Greece, and like Moses, though 800 years later learnt his wisdom from the Priests of Egypt— He founded the Ionic school of Philosophy. He was never married saying when young that it was too soon, and when old that it was too late "

Frost  A tolerable Night’s rest, in consequence of which I suffer less from lethargy, and am able to apply rather more time to labour— I worked an hour with the hoe and spade, the best of all exercise, but which I shall be obliged in a very few days to relinquish— I received a Letter from Mr Frye at Washington informing me that the repair of the Mill dam is finished— He has agreed to pay 1000 dollars for it, and the next heavy rain will sweep it away. This the third Letter that I have received from Mr Frye since I returned from my excursion and which I have neglected to answer But this morning I received a Letter from Nathaniel Cross of Portland, Maine, enquiring what had become of his petition to obtain indemnification for injuries and losses sustained by him at Matanzas in the Island of Cuba, while exercising the functions of Consul of the United States at that place. He was here about this time last year and then told me his pitiable story. His consular agency was merely temporary committed to him by the regular Consul, a title not recognized by the Government there— His petition was presented at the commencement of the last Session by Mr Fessenden, and was referred to the Committee of Foreign Affairs— I believe they made no report upon it, but it was discussed more than once in Committee, and they were unanimously of opinion that it could constitute no claim against the United States. Mr Spencer Warfield of Millville in this Commonwealth, called to see me for mere curiosity, and in the afternoon Dr. Ward Nicholas Boylston called on me— He came to enquire for an answer to a Letter which I received on the 3d. of this month from his Grand mother, which has perplexed me much— Mr W. N. Boylston, by his Will directed that he should be buried at Princeton, and provided for the erection over his remains, under a building which he proposed to give to the town on certain conditions.— He was accordingly buried, there, but the town has not complied with the conditions of the grant— Mrs Boylston has purchased a tomb in the cemetery at Mount Auburn, and wishes to have the remains of her husband deposited there. Her Letter to me was to enquire my opinion, whether she could not by Law have them taken up and removed, without consulting or considering the dispositions or desires of the people of Princeton. I doubt if there is any human Law applicable to the case; and still more whether under the circumstances she could cause the body to be removed without the consent of the People of Princeton. I requested the Doctor to say so to her, and to advise her in my name to do nothing without first attempting to obtain their consent. "

Spading and hoeing perhaps for the last time this Season— The laborious exercise that I have used in the four months since the 16th of May when I came out to Quincy has been greatly conducive to the restoration of my health, but the cold weather will master me: and I fear the consequences, if I undertake to meet it with defiance— I answered the Letter of A. H. Lawrence of Washington, proposing to take on lease or purchase my square 592 in that city; and four Letters of Mr Frye which I had hitherto left unanswered— Also the Letter of James J Lawn, and 4 others a Committee of the Baltimore Mechanics Lyceum, inviting me to deliver a Lecture before them, which I declined— But this effort to retrieve the arrears of my correspondence absorbed the time for keeping up the diary and protracted my evening till close upon midnight— Mrs Margaret Wade a widow of a revolutionary soldier 78 years of age and a claimant for a pension was here, with Mr and Mrs Litchfield, all of Scituate— Mrs Wade said she had been here five years ago with a Mr Bailey, since dead— I had forgotten the fact, but find it recorded in my diary of 4. October 1838. The law limits the right of pension to widows married before the 1st. of January 1794. Mrs Wade was married in June of that year and failed to obtain her pension for that reason— She wishes now to renew her claim and to have her old petition called up, or if necessary to have a new petition presented for her— I promised to call up her old petition if to be found on the files of the house, and if not to write to her that she may prepare and forward a new one— My own list of petitions presented at the 3d Session of the 25th Congress, I could not find—and upon the House Journal of that Session I find only a petition of the heirs of Edward Wade. Deacon Spear was here with a modified proposal of Mr Daniel Baxter to give 100 dollars an acre for 2 acres of my land adjoining his, or to take 70 dollars an acre for his land adjoining mine— I declined taking his offer of 100 dollars an acre for mine, and authorised Mr Spear to offer him 60 dollars an acre for his, which he purchased at auction for 45 dollars an acre— Mr John E. Fuller and his wife were here— He is an agent for trading in old books, and brought with him a number of showy and costly luxuries with splendid engravings of very insignificant personages— I had no use for them, but he offered me a copy of Walton’s Polyglott Bible in 8 folio volumes for 150 dollars, which tempted me almost beyond resistance— It is part of the theological library of the quondam professor John G. Palfrey which he is selling off— Mr Marchant the painter came and took a sitting for my portrait, and dined with us. "

My spading is rather abruptly terminated, having by over eagerness of labour, yesterday morning rubbed off the skin from a spot on the fore finger of the left hand, which is now sore and disabled for labouring at all. How often is over labouring thus checked and rebuked— I dallied however two hours this morning with my time— Miss Susan Tufts called at the gate this morning riding on horseback with Mr Ellis; to enquire of the health of our Ladies. Mrs John and Mrs Charles F. Adams, with Mary Louisa went to Boston and returned to dine, bringing out with them as a Visitor to Mrs Charles, Dr. Bigelow’s daughter— Mr Henry Bowers of Scituate with his son George William Bowers was here. He is the nephew of the late Mrs Cushing, widow of judge William Cushing of the Supreme Court of the United States— She died in 1834 at New-York, and bequeathed by Will to Mr Bowers two small profile portraits in crayons, one of President Washington, and one of my father, and both excellent likenesses.— They were painted from the life at Philadelphia, about the year 1797. Mr Bowers brought and left them with me, asking me on returning them to write him a line expressing my opinion of them as likenesses, and giving the name of the painter if I knew who he was— To the likeness of both I can very fully attest, but I know not who the painter was. Mr Marchant came, dined and took tea with us; and was employed the whole day and evening upon my portrait: painting from the life in two long sittings before and after dinner, and the remainder of the day copying from the portrait which he painted of me at New-York in 1840— He was suffering all day with a severe headache— I answered a Letter from Mr William Lincoln inviting me in the name of the Worcester County Agricultural Society to attend their Cattle Show, Ploughing match and exhibition of manufactures on the 9th of next Month— I cannot spare the time and decline— My Son was here, and I had a long conversation with him on the project for laying out in house lots a part of my lands brought upon the street by the new roads. He is averse to having any dealings with Harvey Field; and lukewarm if not cold to any undertaking to convert the land into house lots— I think I shall give it up altogether— This was the third successive day of weather of more than autumnal cold— We have fires in the dining room and middle parlour, and my patience this afternoon was starved out— I made a fire in my library and sat up writing till midnight.

I strip’d my wild cherry tree of a fourth quart of its fruit, and barely finished when it came onto rain and there was a succession of heavy showers through the day; growing warm all the time to 75 degrees. I marked this morning a shoot coming out from the stem of the wild cherry seedling which I carelessly crop’d sometime since— Some of my self planted English white Oak seedlings are still putting forth their plumelets— But the Ash, horse chesnut and shag bark walnut have long ceased to vegetate for this year.

M’Kennan of Washington Pennsylvania, inviting me to stop a day at his house, going or returning from Cincinnati next November— I accept the invitation conditionally, if I go to Cincinnati at all— I received the Peoria Register of the 1st. of this month: a whig, Clay newspaper in the State of Illinois— It admits the election to Congress for one of the Districts of that State of another Editor of a Newspaper named John Henderson, who in his canvas said— I desire to be elected to Congress in order that I may meet and indignantly hurl back the infamous slanders of John Quincy Adams— This may answer for a counterpart to my late receptions in the western part of New-York— I wasted again much of this afternoon in a fruitless search for papers, and dipped into Mitford’s history of Greece for his account of the Grecian Philosophers; but found it extremely meagre. Bailly on the other hand is copious, but I cannot snatch the time necessary for reading him— My Son, his wife and Miss Bigelow passed the Evening here and Miss Bigelow played delightfully on the Piano. I drudge on from day to day with one page of my astronomical address, and this evening completed my task at 11 O Clock— If I should intermit the labour but for one day, it is doubtful if I should ever resume it— I should certainly not be ready for the performance of my promise— I see by the Newspapers that at the Convention of whigs of Norfolk County at Dedham last Saturday the 9th. among their Resolutions, they appointed a Committee consisting of Benjamin F. Copeland of Roxbury, Josiah Brigham of Quincy, and Tileston of Dorchester, to invite me to meet and address the citizens of the County, some time before the election. "

                "text": "16. IV. Saturday  Summer has returned, and the Thermometer has been part of this day as high as 80— Mr Marchant was again here almost the whole day; and took half a dozen sittings, of about half an hour at a time, from shortly after breakfast till evening twilight— He dined and took tea with us; and finished at last the portrait— My wife and all the family think it far better as a likeness than that which he painted in November 1840— I see it is more laboured and finished; but the likeness is not so strong— Mr Lunt came, and borrowed from the Adams library, Wartons history of English Poetry 3. Volumes 4to. He also mentioned that he had received an invitation from Dr Gray’s Church at Jamaica Plains, to our church to the ordination of a young man named Allen, a son of Mr Allen of Northborough, Dr Gray having resigned his pastoral Office; and Mr Lunt enquired if I would be willing to go with him as a delegate from the Quincy Church, to which I readily assented— Mrs T. B. Adams was here this afternoon with her Sister Mrs. Nehemiah Foster and her Son Isaac Hull. Mrs. Adams and Hull returned last Evening from their visits to Cedar Grove and Newburgh and Utica— Elizabeth returned to New York city and remains with Mrs Bartlett. About Sunset a young man, son of Coll. Vinson of Dorchester came with Miss Bradley to view Mr Marchants new Portrait of me— Charles and his wife spent the evening here, together with Miss Bigelow who played charmingly on the Piano— I was up again till past midnight to write a page of my astronomical discourse— I answered a Letter from Mrs. Alicia Boylston, and I read a few pages of Bailly’s history of Antient Astronomy. His theory of an antedulivan People highly civilized, and possessed of the Science of Astronomy, very nearly if not quite equal to the progress of the time when he wrote, has scarcely a shadow of historical fact to sustain him— I cannot but suspect that it is merely a device to discredit the cosmogony of the bible, and especially the mosaic account of the deluge. He professes throughout the most profound reverence for the scriptural history but he takes no notice of the confusion of tongues after the flood and insists that one great people destroyed by the deluge had made all the modern discoveries in astronomical Science including even the laws of Kepler and the gravitation of Newton— There is indeed no doubt that in the Grecian School of Pythagoras, the Copernican system had been broached that the Sun was the centre of the world and the planets bodies revolving round him.

                "text": "17. IV:30. Sunday—  Sun rose 5:41. Set 6.9—  Mr Gannett (I believe Dr. Gannett) minister of the federal Street church in Boston and sometime a colleague of the late Dr W. E. Channing preached here, this morning from Romans 1.16. [“]For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation”—omitting the remainder of the verse—“to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.” Mr Gannett enjoys a high reputation as a preacher. He must therefore abide a severer scrutiny than others— The text did not promise much— It was well for St Paul standing before hosts of inveterate foes, Jews and Gentiles; to say he was not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; and to assign for it the reason that it is the power of God unto salvation— But for a protestant divine of this age, and in this Country should boast that he is not ashamed of the gospel of the Christ, has a ludicrous aspect— Who is ashamed of it?— But it is not at this day the power of God unto Salvation first to the jew and also to the Greek— That stage of its existence has passed away; and I could not see the useful application to the present times or the sentiment in the text— The Sermon did not much relieve me. Mr Gannett dined with us; and when we returned from meeting we found Mr and Mrs. A. J. Downing of Newburgh at our house. They dined with us—visited at my Sons and at Mrs T. B. Adams’s—took tea at Mrs Edwards Miller’s, and returned this evening to Mr Benjamin Guild’s at Brookline—whence they are to depart tomorrow afternoon to return home. Dr. Gannett’s afternoon sermon was from Luke 9.23. “And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.”— This discourse made amends for the deficiencies of that of the morning.— It was perhaps not better but more suited to my taste— The Christians daily cross; dwelling with great emphasis on the word daily— There is in this excellent morality. The argument was that the Christian is called to suffer and to act in the performance of duty every day— The profound conviction of this and vigorous exertion for the fulfilment of the duty, constitutes the Christian, and the pattern of the perfect man— There is no more useful sermon than this. Two men calling themselves Luther and Eaton, professing to come from Fall river, and to be going to Brighton stop’d here and said that they had come so far out of their way for the sole purpose of seeing me— Their looks were not prepossessing. Mr Lunt returning from Boston brought me a Letter from judge John Davis, with Middleton’s celestial Atlas— I examined it with Mary, and found it more convenient for recognizing the constellations and fixed stars than Bode’s Uranographia which is too unwieldy for convenience.

Another change of weather to high summer heat, and swarms of moschito’s more annoying than I ever knew them— I met last evening a man who accosted me and said his name was Joseph Burrell a son of Peter Burrell who formerly lived with my father. I remembered that in the autumn of 1779. my mother sent me on horseback to Weymouth, where I took up behind me a ragged boy named Peter Burrell, and brought him to my mothers, where he lived a year or two as a waiting boy. He is now 79 years of age, and father of this Mr Joseph Burrell, who spoke to me of propagating apple trees by slips or twigs— I made preparation for doctoring an apple-tree in the alley beyond Charles’s house, surrounded by Weeds, Blackberry vines and suckers— It will make me a week’s hard labour for exercise— I cut out the cores of 12 bergamot pears from the new tree, and planted them in a row immediately behind my sentry box for my tools. Mr Frederick Taft of Uxbridge a revolutionary soldier 85 years of age was here with his son Ezra Taft of Boston. The father is going to Braintree and Randolph upon genealogical researches: the minister of the Church in the south precinct of Braintree, now Randolph, having been of the name of Taft— This Gentleman called to see me from mere curiosity and sympathy— Mr Nathan Crosby came with an annual subscription book for contributions to promote the cause of Temperance, but I did not subscribe— Messrs. B. F. Copeland, Tileston, Brigham and Richardson came this afternoon, and communicated to me the Resolution adopted at the Norfolk County whig convention at Dedham, on the 9th. of this month, appointing them a Committee to wait on me and invite me to address the citizens of the County of Norfolk, at some time before the election. I accepted the invitation and agreed to meet them at Dedham on Thursday the 26th. of October at 10. O’Clock— I requested however that notice might be given to the 5 towns in the County of Middlesex and the 4 in the County of Plymouth of the meeting; with an invitation to attend it, which they said should be done— Mr Tileston spoke to me of a historical Society at Dorchester of which I have been elected an honorary member, which I have neglected to acknowledge. Commodore Pearson of the Navy was here— He had a claim to promotion which he says in consequence of his absence at sea was overlooked in Jany 1829. and although it was laid before me, through the then Secretary of the Navy Samuel L. Southard it has never been restored. Mr Cummings came with an invitation from the Pic Nic of Ladies on the Hancock lot next Wednesday at half past 1. O’Clock— He gave me also an invitation from the Quincy Lyceum to deliver a Lecture before them, in October which I conditionally promised.— I wrote Letters 1. to Albert Gallatin, introductory for Mr Marchant 2 to President Josiah Quincy, for a meeting of the Supervisors of the Adams temple and school fund on Wednesday—and 3. to judge John Davis to thank him for the loan of Middleton’s celestial Atlas.

In search of laborious exercise I undertook this morning with my Spade, hoe and Saw to clear out an apple tree close to the wall in the ally leading over the hill, beyond Charles’s house— It is overrun with suckers and the ground over its root is hard bound almost as stone, and covered with blackberry vines; unapproachable— With my spade and hoe, I broke up the ground; about one half surrounding the trunk and took off a couple of the suckers nearest to the surface of the ground— It was a sweating work of two hours; the remainder of which I left for to-morrow— The wild cherry seedling that I crop’d off some time since has put out two or three buttons, and close under the crop two leaves.— And this morning for the first time I saw 2 pears on the sucker tree near the dwarf apple tree. It is a bergamot and must be at least 25 years old— I thought it never would bear— Mr Nathan Crosby called on me again, with his Son Stephen Moody Crosby; whose mother is the daughter of my brother Thomas’s Classmate Stephen Moody, recently deceased— He came again to my son’s house for his contribution to the Temperance funds— Mr Thomas Loring came to renew the proposal for another fishing party. I agreed to meet him at his house on Thursday Morning at 7. O’Clock, if the weather promise to be fair; and if not, either of the following days Friday or Saturday.— I find it impossible, taking three hours of exercise a day, to write the page of Journal, two or three short Letters, and even one page of the Astronomical Discourse—and having yesterday written three short Letters, I was last night, spell bound, and physically unable to write more than three or four lines— This day I made an effort and got through my journal page by 11. but then fell to searching for files of Letters and papers, which took up the time till dinner— I received a second Letter from Mr Giddings, with one of the same date (13 September) from him, James M Bloss, and Gaius N. St John, as a Committee of the People of Ashtabula County, Ohio inviting me to visit them on my way to or returning from Cincinnati— This afternoon I answered the invitation and the Letter from Giddings; but it left me in the evening only the power to finish the page I had begun yesterday of my discourse. In the distribution of my time, it is distressing to be so exceedingly straitened for hours to read; and I feel it cruelly now—when I want to compress a history of Astronomy into a discourse of three hours delivery. My task is to turn this transient gust of enthusiasm for the Science of astronomy at Cincinnati into a permanent and persevering national pursuit which may extend the bounds of human knowledge, and make my country instrumental in elevating the character and improving the condition of man upon Earth— The hand of God himself has furnished me this opportunity to do good— But O! how much will depend upon my manner of performing that task? and with what agony of soul must I implore the aid of almighty wisdom for powers of conception, energy of exertion and unconquerable will to accomplish my design.

Planted sundry pears in the summer garden cellar, and picked a pin of wild cherries from the kitchen seedling to steep. The return of the warm weather makes it again agreeable to work on the ground and in the open air before Sunrise— The heavy dews constitute an objection, and require coarse pantaloons, and heavy shoes— At noon was held at my house the annual meeting of the supervisors of the Adams temple and school fund— All the members present— President Quincy came from Cambridge. Mr Thomas Greenleaf, Mr Beale and my son all attended. Mr Greenleaf made a report on the state of the Treasurer’s accounts, which was accepted and the same Committee was appointed to examine the Treasurers accounts of the present year to be reported at the next annual meeting— There are no rules established for the transactions of this corporation—and at my motion a Committee consisting of Mr Greenleaf, Mr Beale and my Son was appointed to prepare, and report rules at the next annual meeting.— The principal rule needed is a provision for regular annual meetings. Hitherto there has been no such provision—the yearly meetings have all been called at my instance and held at my house. Mr Greenleaf and Mr Beale were also appointed a Committee to examine and report upon the condition of the Library given by my father to the town of Quincy— There is danger that unless one regular annual meeting of the corporation is held, and an annual examination of the condition of the provided for by standing rules, the library will be lost by dispersion or perish by the depredations of rats mice and moths. A duty devolves on me, and on my Son by continued and persevering attention to prevent the gift of my father to the town of Quincy, from perishing by neglect, and ultimately if in our power to carry it into full execution— The members of the corporation, Mrs C. F. Adams with her daughter Louisa and Henry, Miss Bigelow, and Mr. Lunt dined with us, and we made it so late before dinner was over, that I did not attend the Pic Nic of the Ladies of Quincy at the Hancock and Adams lot— President Quincy brought me from the University Library the 4. volumes of Bailly’s history of ancient and modern Astronomy. Mr John B. Kirkham was here this evening. He said he came expressly from Springfield to invite me to deliver a Lecture for the Lyceum there this Autumn— After some hesitation, I promised if it should be in my power to deliver a Lecture or an address at Springfield on Wednesday the 1st. of November, and the thought occurred to me of making my expedition to Cincinnati itself the subject of that Lecture.— This suggestion pleased me so much that I began and wrote one page of such a Lecture; but it kept me up till past midnight—lost me a second day for the astronomical discourse, and agitated me too much. Miss Bigelow gave us a delightful evening of performance on the Piano. "

I was expecting to hear it strike 1.— I slept therefore between two and three hours, believing all the time that I was wide awake: a state of existence bordering I fear upon insanity; and which I contemplate with some alarm. I rose however at 4. and after an hour occupied in washing scrubbing and dressing, I went up the hill and roused my son, came back and roused the cook and coachman of my own family. Benjamin tackled with one horse— I returned to Charles’s house to see the Sun rise, on this the equinoctial day; but there was a thick border of haze just over the eastern horizon, and the rising sun could not be seen— My son drove me in the Carryall to Hingham; whence we went with Mr Thomas Loring and Mr Quincy Thaxter to Mr Nicholls’s house at Cohasset— And thence with a small row boat, we went under the lee of a rock and fished for pearch about 3 hours— We caught a bucket full, with a due proportion of Pollock, flounders and one Tautaug—at half past 12 we returned to the shore, and then with Fahrenheit’s Thermometer at 90 to Mr Loring’s house at Hingham— There we had a dinner of Chowder and fried pearch. Mr Baker and Mrs Quincy Thaxter with a baby girl 8 months old were there.— Mr Baker gave me Charles Willmer’s American News-Letter of the 5th. of this month, containing Queen Victoria’s speech on proroguing Parliament in person—after which she went to visit the king of France at the Chateau d’Eu. At 4 O’Clock we left Mr Loring’s house at returned home, with the Sun in our faces all the way. We reached home at 5. O’Clock, but I was so heated, so weary, and so heavy with the sleepless drowsiness of last night that I was disabled for all useful toil, and could not even write the journal of yesterday I found on my table, a Letter from judge Burnet and from professor O. M. Mitchell of Cincinnati, requesting me to fix the day for the ceremony of laying the corner stone of the Astronomical observatory there; and proposing Tuesday the 7th. of November. Also a Letter from W. B. Read of Philadelphia reminding me of a conditional engagement which I had contracted last May, to deliver a discourse upon some historical subject, before the historical Society of Pennsylvania, next November. I had already received a Letter of the 15th from Edward Armstrong a similar Letter he is the Secretary of the Society— When I promised professor Mitchell at the Niagara Falls to go to Cincinnati next November I totally forgot this engagement to the Pennsylvania Society; and it now comes upon me with grievous pressure and I know not what to do— This Evening was partly clear, and with Middleton’s celestial Atlas, I pointed out to my two Granddaughters Mary Louisa and Louisa Catherine most of the Constellations visible in the hemisphere now over us from the setting Scorpion to the rising Bull—and I verified the Star Fomalhaut.

Benjamin tackled with one horse— I returned to Charles’s house to see the Sun rise, on this the equinoctial day; but there was a thick border of haze just over the eastern horizon, and the rising sun could not be seen— My son drove me in the Carryall to Hingham; whence we went with Mr Thomas Loring and Mr Quincy Thaxter to Mr Nicholls’s house at Cohasset— And thence with a small row boat, we went under the lee of a rock and fished for pearch about 3 hours— We caught a bucket full, with a due proportion of Pollock, flounders and one Tautaug—at half past 12 we returned to the shore, and then with Fahrenheit’s Thermometer at 90 to Mr Loring’s house at Hingham— There we had a dinner of Chowder and fried pearch. Mr Baker and Mrs Quincy Thaxter with a baby girl 8 months old were there.— Mr Baker gave me Charles Willmer’s American News-Letter of the 5th. of this month, containing Queen Victoria’s speech on proroguing Parliament in person—after which she went to visit the king of France at the Chateau d’Eu. At 4 O’Clock we left Mr Loring’s house at returned home, with the Sun in our faces all the way. We reached home at 5. O’Clock, but I was so heated, so weary, and so heavy with the sleepless drowsiness of last night that I was disabled for all useful toil, and could not even write the journal of yesterday I found on my table, a Letter from judge Burnet and from professor O. M. Mitchell of Cincinnati, requesting me to fix the day for the ceremony of laying the corner stone of the Astronomical observatory there; and proposing Tuesday the 7th. of November. Also a Letter from W. B. Read of Philadelphia reminding me of a conditional engagement which I had contracted last May, to deliver a discourse upon some historical subject, before the historical Society of Pennsylvania, next November.

The excitement of the invitation last Evening from Springfield, of the design formed in consequence of it with the engagement previously undertaken by me to address the People of Norfolk County on Politics, on the 26th. of next month, and the thoughts which rushed upon me in connection with these manifold engagements was so great that I was not conscious of sleeping a wink the whole night— I rose convinced that I had not slept a moment— But I heard the Clock strike 12 and 4.

I finished the trimming of the Apple tree in the alley on the hill beyond Charles’s house, and took off a bush of suckers.— The shoot from the cropped seedling wild cherry has put out a third leaf— I rubbed off an incipient leaf from a bud below. I first observed yesterday emerging from the soil the leaves of a seedling English white oak, in the row four of which came out about the 1st. of July. I suspect that the difference in the time of subterranean vegetation before they come up depends upon the depth at which they are planted; and that the safest from the fatal hand of frost may be those which go over the second winter before they come up.— The self planted on the spot in the garden where the tree was taken up last fall, have four out of the 16. a third spindle shoot now expanding leaves, and the tallest of them is 12 inches high, and the leaves have yet time for full developement before the frost will set in and suspend all vegetation for the winter— From this size down to two inches high I have every variety of the English white oak seedling of the present year. George Newcomb came to enquire concerning his petition in behalf of the owners of the Schooner Rosanne, and after about an hour of search I could find nothing about it, either in the Journal of the last Session of the house, or in my own minutes or diary. So I must turn it over for further enquiry— I completed the Diary of the day before yesterday and of yesterday, and wrote two Letters—one in answer to W. F Channing, enclosing a Letter to me, dated September 1841. from his now deceased father Dr W. E. Channing, complying with W. F. Channing’s request that I would send him any Letters that I had received from his father; of whose life he is preparing a Memoir, and one to James Eaton, Secretary of the Lyceum at Malden, declining an invitation to deliver an introductory Lecture before them. I was proceeding to write another Letter when I received a note from Robert Gourlay, more than 20 years since an agitator in Canada scarcely less terrible than Daniel O’Connell is in Ireland now— The British Government of the Province then seized and transported home to Scotland, and broke up his revolutionary movement; since which I had scarcely heard the sound of his name till I received the day before I left Washington last May, a Letter from him dated at Boston, with an enclosed small pamphlet and expressing a desire for an interview with me. I did not answer it but this afternoon received a note from him, repeating the wish for an interview and enclosing another pamphlet; I answered that I would receive him immediately and he came— But he had nothing to say to me, except that he was now going to Canada to claim of the Legislature indemnity for his past persecutions. Mr and Mrs Grinnell, with Cornelia and Miss Otté took tea here. The Young Ladies are now returning from Cayuga lake to New-Bedford. "

My morning exercise was light—a second pint measure made 5 quarts of wild cherries, picked from the seedling in the garden opposite the kitchen window, to steep— Curiosity enquires how this little sapling bears the fruit in profusion which five full sized trees could scarcely equal— What is the philosophy of bearing trees? what proportion do they bear to the barren, and what is the cause of barrenness? Mr John N. Bernard came as a mendicant with a subscription book and not many names— He is the son of a comic actor of the old Boston company to whom I was indebted for many pleasant and cheerful hours. He himself he says followed the Sea— Was wild and extravagant; and disregarded his fathers wise precepts and prudent counsels— At last he broke his knee, and was crippled since which he has been unable to go to Sea, and to earn his living in any way— For two or three years he has been itinerating round the country, throughout New-England and delivering Temperance Lectures— But the excitement has passed away, and the people will no longer hear his Lectures on Temperance— He is compelled therefore to appeal to the charitable for assistance, and his appeal is not always in vain— While we were at dinner, Mr Philbrick a teacher in the Roxbury high School came with a youth named Augustine Reed, a candidate for a Cadet warrant at the Military Academy at West Point— He had certificates of competency from M. A. D’Wolfe Howe, episcopal and George Putnam congregational minister at Roxbury, Samuel H. Walley junr and Dan Leach a teacher at the school—all which he left with me. I promised to cause his name to be entered in the book of Candidates at the War Department, and to deposit his certificates with the entry— And I explained to him that no Cadet Warrant can issue for the 8th. Congressional district of Massachusetts, till a year from next March and then he must be designated by the Member of H.R.U.S. from this District in the next Congress— My wife, with her two daughters and Louisa C. Smith went to Hingham, visited Mrs T. Loring and the Misses Thaxter, and brought home Mrs Charles’s two sons John and Charles— I wrote Letters to Edward Armstrong Secretary of the historical Society of Pennsylvania, requesting to be released from the engagement to deliver a historical Lecture before them next November; and I glanced over the Astronomische Nachrichten of Schumacher—Altona August 1826. where I found a notice of the life of  Joseph Fraunhofer.  Born at Straubing in Bavaria 6. March 1787. His father was a glazier and destined him to his own trade. In his 11th. year he lost both his parents— His guardian bound him to Weichselberger a Glassmaker in Munich for 6 years without charge and without compensation. Neither his father nor Weichselberger allowed him any schooling. After many misfortunes and obstacles he became connected as optician with the mathematical institute of Reichenbach Utzschneider and Liebherr, and there acquired his fame as an unrivalled maker of Telescopes. He died on the 7th of June 1826—aged 39. "

[“]Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are Peace”— The discourse was upon the pleasures of religion, but I was in a lethargy and unable to listen with attention— There was a great change last evening in the atmosphere to sultry damp, the effect of which upon my body was to produce a dull heavy headache, and a sluggish sulky rhumatic uneasiness all over me. I went to bed soon after 10 and to sleep— I awoke at the stroke of the clock with an excruciating cramp in my right leg— I supposed the clock was striking 4. but it struck 12— My cramp passed off but the head ache remained— I slept no more, but lay and heard the clock strike 2 and 3. during which the relieving perspiration came on. At half past 3. I rose, dressed. wrote a page of my astronomical address and as Sun rise approached went up the hill and saw it from the Eastern corner of Charles’s house— I returned and wrote with the interval for breakfast till the second bell for meeting was ringing whereby my indispensable days work was done; but I was in a state of torpor the whole day— The weather was of the very hottest of the Summer. Mr White dined with us and preached after dinner from Mark 6.20. [“]For Herod favored John, knowing that he was a just man, and an holy.”—omitting the remainder of the verse— The discourse was upon the duty and the blessing of an holy life. An excellent theme, but I had the malady of not listening as in the morning; altogether involuntary, and the unfailing consequence of a headache and sleepless night.— I had barely returned home from afternoon meeting, when Mr Degrand came in from Boston, with his nephew named Oxnard, a young Frenchman from Marseilles, and Mr Clapp senior editor of the Boston evening Gazette who took tea and spent the Evening with us. Mr Degrand took my Letters to Edward Armstrong and W. B. Reed, to put into the Post-Office at Boston. Extreme lassitude disabled me for writing and drove me to bed soon after 10  Fraunhofer.  While he was an apprentice at Weichselberger’s, the house fell in, and buried him under its ruins. He was dug out of them alive, the king of Bavaria having repaired to the spot, cheering the workmen who dug him out by his presence and his exhortations—and upon his deliverance gave him 18 ducats— With part of the money he purchased a machine for grinding glass, and made experiments with it in the leisure of holidays, without success. He resorted to Treatises upon Optics, but found they required previous elementary mathematics, for the acquisition of which he was obliged to steal holiday hours out of his masters house, for in it the use of Books was interdicted to him— He had been very imperfectly taught even to write— In despite of all these obstacles and discouragements, he persevered indefatigably in pursuit of the science of optics with the unconquerable will which cannot be disappointed.

Rainy—  A pattern day— After a night of sound sleep I awoke free from head ache— My washing, scrubbing—dressing took an hour of gentle exercise— Then two hours with the Spade and hoe to clear the ground about the stump of a mazzard cherry tree on the hill, eastern side of the alley opposite Charles’s gate; and to enlarge the plat round a seedling mazzard in the Seminary. This is hard and ungrateful work— The rest of the day with the intervals for breakfast, dinner, tea, and an hour of relaxation with my family and Charles, and about two hours of wilful idleness, a waking substitute for sleep was employed on my daily labour and produced. 1. The page of yesterday’s diary— 2 A page and a half of Astronomical discourse. 3. An Answer to Cyrus Curtiss, President of the Franklin Library Association at Hudson New-York, declining to deliver an introductory Lecture before that institution next October or November, and 4 my name, autograph on a card engraving of my portrait by Durand, directed to Elwood Evans age 14 years at Philadelphia— This is all and O! how small— But I wandered into Cerisier’s Tableau of the history of the United Netherlands—into Potter’s Grecian Antiquities— In search of Ludwig’s German and English Dictionary; and all for enquiries not one of which was satisfied.— In tracing the history of Antient Astronomy, especially that of the Grecian schools I get entangled in details of speculative opinions held by numerous individuals most of whose names are scarcely remembered, and they dog my progress so that I shall be hard put to it to get rid of them— But how shall I collect in a focus all the rays of human intelligence gathering to shed light on the Science of Astronomy?— The Pythagorean square of the hypothenuse—the polarity of the magnet—and last of all the telescope—the glass lens! which brings me again to  Fraunhofer—  With the remainder of the king of Bavaria’s donation, he purchased of his master the last half year of his apprenticeship, and sought to earn his livelihood by engraving visiting cards— This proved but a precarious resource, till by a lucky chance, Utzschneider engaged him as an Optician— Here was the field for the display of his powers. His first labours were the making of objective glasses for astronomical observatories. In 1809. Utzschneider erected with him and Reichenboch the optical institute at Benedictbeurn. In 1811. he introduced a new and improved mode of melting glass. In 1818 he undertook the whole direction of the establishment. Of his optical discoveries he communicated an account to the Bavarian royal Academy of Sciences, and published a French translation in Schumacher’s periodical. One of his theories was first published in the 3d. number of the Nachrichten. His Telescopes surpassed any that had ever been made before. The largest yet known was made for the observatory at Dorpat. He left another of the same power nearly finished— A larger one of 12 inches aperture was begun. "

I worked an hour and a half at the mazzard cherry-tree stump in the alley on the hill nearly opposite Charles’s house; light clad in raw cold weather, to warm myself by labour— Charles went to Boston and returned to dine. E Price Greenleaf came this afternoon and looked over the last budded seedling Apple trees in the seminary, most of which have taken— But he found a worm at the root of the tall seedling at the seminary gate; and one at the root of that near the Summer house cellar— I planted in flower pot N. 3. the core of a Bartlet pear and a row of rotten pears and peaches in the garden and orchard corner— I had an afternoon visit from Dr Duggan, whom I had not seen since we parted at Saratoga. His wife’s uncle, Daniel Glover, then his Patient, derived no benefit from the Springs, and soon after came with him home and died. The Doctor is a man of smooth speech, smiling face, and courteous demeanour: always extremely observant of me but not much my friend. He gave me to understand that he had made at Saratoga many minutes for Letters to Green the Editor of the Quincy Patriot, for publication; and had specially intended in those Letters to do me honour. But he had himself been very sick at Saratoga, and had not entirely recovered since his return; and having been much and painfully engaged in attendance, on his relative Mr Glover, till his death, and on the administration of his affairs since his Letters had not been published— Charles and his wife passed the evening here with their daughter Louisa Catherine. Mr Brooks goes to New-Bedford to-morrow.— I answered the Letter of enquiries from Revd. Henry F. Harrington of Providence, R.I. and declined the invitation of Philip W Lowry, J. Cohen and E. J. Dubois, Committee of the mechanical library association of Baltimore, to deliver before them a Lecture in October or November coming. I received Letters 1. from John A. Parker of New-York, with the Evening Post containing his petition to Governor Bouck, to sue the States of Pennsylvania and Illinois for their debts to him. 2. From Ezekiel Bacon of Utica, with an Oneida whig, and a Utica daily Gazette containing a narrative of his recent visit to the falls of Niagara. The papers are of the 17th. instt. 3. A Letter of sharp rebuke from Arthur St. Clair Nichols, at the Havana 1. Septr. 43. charging me with calumny for saying at Auburn that the Roman Catholics worship the Virgin Mary— 4. A Letter of invitation from Alexander Hay, Mayor of Pittsburgh and 19 others, and yesterday— A Letter from Stephen B. Tompkins and 8 others, 19. Septr. 43 White plains, West Chester County New-York, inviting me to the anniversary celebration of the Battle there, 28. October, and to deliver an Address— "

A change comes over my whereabouts, if not over the spirit of my dream— I had my journal of yesterday written when I was called to breakfast, and that was all that I could accomplish—and rising at four, it is all that I ever can accomplish— From breakfast till 1. p.m. I was constantly occupied, with the interval of a visit from Mr Minott Thayer, with a young man named Ides, in packing my small black trunk for a journey to New-Bedford—to be gone two days. Such a mountain must I make of a molehill. My astronomical Discourse, and my address to the people of Norfolk County, are forcibly suspended, and I could barely find time to read Mr Bacon’s report of his late visit to the Niagara Falls and to answer the enquiries of the Revd. Benjamin F. Harrington of Providence. At one, we dined and at a quarter past 2. I left home with Louisa C. Smith who alighted at Mr James H. Fosters in Boston, and my granddaughter Mary-Louisa, who was on a shoping excursion, I stop’d at Mr Edward Brooks’s where I found him and his family and Mrs Peter C. Brooks at dinner— It was but a quarter past 3. I made a short visit to judge Davis and found him with his three daughters a grand daughter and a great grand daughter.— I had a short conversation with him upon Middleton’s celestial Atlas, and hurried back to Mr Edward Brooks’s, at whose door his father was stopping in to my Carriage and we drove to the depot of the New-Bedford Railway, which we reached on the stroke of four; step’d into the Car and were off, with scarcely time to greet Mr Grinnell who was waiting for us there— At half past six we alighted from the cars and step’d into Mr Grinnell’s carriage at New-Bedford— They call it 55 miles. It may be 50— The road is half the way the same as that to Providence; but the movement is so rapid that there is scarcely time to count the towns we pass through on the road. There was a cavalcade of firemen with lighted torches at the depot who escorted us to Mr Grinnell’s house, and a crowd of boys followed us shouting to the great consternation of Mr Grinnell’s horses; to no small personal danger and great annoyance of us all— Yet it was meant in honour to me, of which I was duly sensible in gratitude to him who disposes of the minds of men. Numbers of visitors course in to Mr Grinnell’s in the course of the evening among whom the selectmen of the town, the chairman of whom Mr Congdon, told me that they would come to-morrow at 12 O’Clock and take me to the town hall and introduce me to the citizens of New-Bedford— "

I wrote with assiduity till breakfast time at 8 and finished the diary of yesterday. After Breakfast, Mr Grinnell took Mr Brooks, and me in his Carriage first to see his father a very neat clad and gravely dignified old man, who told me he was just ten years older than myself being just turned of his 86th. year. He has enjoyed sound health till within two or three years but is now infirm with rhumatic complaints.— Our next visit was to Mrs Russell mother of Mrs Grinnell, an old Lady of 82. also of the Society of Friends. She lives in a large square wooden house which has been removed from a street different from that on which it now stands— And our third visit was to Mr and Mrs Arnold in the same hourse where we met an evening party in September 1835. The year after which they went to Europe, and travelled three years— Their house was then graceful and comfortable, and furnished with elegance, and at great cost— It is now embellished with many articles of exquisite luxury from Italy, that it is like a second princely palace.— Mr Arnold was not at home, but Mrs Arnold received and treated with a profusion of flowers and of fruits—grapes, pears and peaches— We returned to Mr Grinnell’s at 12 and found waiting there the selectmen, Congdon, Howland and Kempton, with whom I went in a Carriage to the town Hall, a new store, and spacious building.— There on the platform where the Selectmen have their Seats Mr Congdon addressed me in a speech carefully composed and handsomely delivered, of about 20 minutes—and introduced me to the Meeting composed entirely of men— I answered him in a speech of half an hour, like all the other extraordinary and extemporaneous speeches that I have been doomed to deliver a source to me of deep mortification from the consciousness, how flat and impotent is every effort of mine of this kind—and I was on this occasion more than usually dull— After the speeches came the shaking of hands for a half an hour— I met there unexpectedly Dr Thomas Robbins of Mattapoisett. Mr Brooks and Mr Grinnell went to the Hall, but did not come up to the platform— The Select men returned with me and left me at Mr Grinnell’s where there was a small party of 12 to dine— The Revd. Mr Peabody and Mr Arnold were of the company— Discussion upon theatrical entertainments— At 4. O’Clock the Selectmen came and took me to Mr Howland’s where a considerable number of Ladies had assembled, and received my very respectful salutations. Mr Grinnell came with Mr Brooks came and took us to ride over the river and round the town of Fairhaven. We returned to Mr Grinnell’s where there was a large evening party; Ladies and Gentlemen to meet us. "

Yet I had a good night’s rest and awoke this morning with the dawn well advanced. I saw the Sun rise glorious in front of my window but had no time, but to dress and pack my trunk for departure. At a quarter past six we breakfasted—then took leave of Mrs Grinnell and the young Ladies— Mr Grinnell took us in his carriage to the railroad depot, and accompanied us to Boston— The train started from the depot precisely at 7. and we landed at the depot at the bottom of the common in Boston at ten— In the cars I met a young man named Elliot, son of Mr and Mrs Elliot of Washington, and Mr Durfee (Nathan) a representative in the Legislature of the Commonwealth from Fall-river in 1841— At the depot in Boston I parted from Mr Brooks and Mr Grinnell; stop’d at the shop of Mr Mitchell, Seal engraver and took the Seal ordered for Captain Buchanan— I found my Son at his office, and Mr Spooner came in while I was there— I hurried to Mr William Bowditch’s in Otis place. Neither he nor his wife was at home, and I had no small difficulty in obtaining, but did obtain access to the library. I was an hour and a half intensely engaged in searching for the volumes of Schumacher’s Astronomische Nachrichten, containing the accounts of the erection by the Russian Emperor Nicholas of the Astronomical Observatory of Pulkova— I found two of them at last—Volumes 11. and 13.— Numbers 264. August 1834. and 290. 291. 292 18. Novr 1835. I took out the Books and entered my name as the borrower. I next called upon judge Davis, and had a further conversation of half an hour with him. He lent me the companion to Middleton’s celestial Atlas, and also, a Mercator’s map of the Starry heavens comprehending the whole equinoctial and terminated by the polar Circle, published many years ago by William Croswell, a college associate of judge Davis. This is an aid to the study of the constellations of which I had never before heard. At one O’Clock I met by previous agreement with my Son, him and his daughter Louisa Catherine, at Dr Frothingham’s where the Carriage was at that time ordered. Neither the Doctor, nor Mrs Frothingham was at home— But we met there at the time— Benjamin, the driver was punctual to the time with the Carriage, and we came home to Quincy to dine— I came home, burdened more than I ever was before, but with spirits too much dissipated to resume at once the broken thread. A Mr Fuller of Newton with his wife a daughter of William Jackson, returning from an excursion to Plymouth, called to see me for curiosity— Mr Marsh teacher of a school at Milton came with a subscription paper for a contribution to purchase an apparatus for lectures on Natural philosophy: to cost 500 dollars. I went up the hill at Sunset to see Mrs Charles but she was out on a visit to Mrs Lunt— She and Charles afterwards came and spent a short evening here— I could accomplish nothing more than the diary of yesterday though I began with Mary Louisa, the companion to Middleton’s celestial Atlas, comparing the book with the maps; and both with the real spangles in the skies which were never arrayed in brighter splendor than this Evening. I recognized several old acquaintance among the constellations. "

I wrought with my spade and hoe upon the hill; but found work which can only be done with the plough— The mornings are becoming so cold, and the pressure of my indoor work so excessive that I must henceforth renounce my excursions before sunrise, or limit them to a quarter of an hour. My visitors this day were Lovell Childs; a young man who said he resided at Andover; had some business in this part of the country, and came to see me, from mere curiosity— Next P. Emory Aldrich of Prescott, Massachusetts, William Baker of Newark, Ohio and Daniel D. Atchison of Lexington Kentucky, Students at the Law-school in Cambridge, told me that they came to Quincy to see me and the quarries.— After a short conversation they asked for my autograph— I wrote my name on 3 visiting cards with the date, and asked them, much to their amusement, for their autographs in return; which they gave me, all on one sheet of Letter paper— Then a young man, named George Warren, came from Boston with a recommendatory Letter from William Hayden senior editor of the Atlas, and accompanied by another young man named Turner, to invite and urge me to deliver a Lecture before the mercantile library association, which I was constrained to decline— Mr Lunt was here this evening, wanting to borrow Eliot’s biography for some notice of the death of Leonard Hoar sometime President of Harvard College— The book was at my Son’s up the hill— Mr Lunt found it there, but not what he wanted in it— I strip’d the remainder of wild cherries from the garden seedling, about half a pint, but a full quart had been borrowed while I was at New-Bedford— I picked up a dozen English white oak acorns fallen from the trees; but they all floated. Five or six that I gathered sunk and are plantable— I bought in a wool clad worm with the twig and leaf on which I found him— Charles’s sons John and Charles were brought home from Hingham, and Miss Sampson was taken home to Braintree this afternoon. I read in Schumacher’s Astronomische Nachrichten N. 264. August 1834. the first notice of the Pulkova observatory; and made some further progress in reading Bailly’s history—but not half a page in writing my own address; though I wrote myself more than once asleep.— Charles and his wife were here in the evening. I read with Mary Louisa two Sections of the Companion to Middleton’s celestial Atlas—comparing them with the maps and with the stars in the sky— The Mercator’s map of Croswell is not of much use— I was compelled by mere heaviness of spirit to retire to bed immediately after ten.

                "text": "1. IV:15. Sunday.  Sun rose 5.56. beclouded. Fahrenheit 50.  I walked up the hill to see the Sun rise— There was a thin border of cloud at the horizon, intercepting the first sunbeam; then a strip of clear sky from which his effulgence radiated for a transient moment, and then a thick body of cloud extending all over the sky, under which he disappeared, and was no more seen this day— I allowed myself but 20 minutes of morning walk and before I got back to my table there was a sprinkling drop by drop of rain over my head. It increased to a moderate calm steady rain which continued the whole day till Evening when it freshened to a North eastern breeze and copious showers— I rode morning and evening to and from meeting. Mr Lunt preached in the morning from Luke 7.47. [“]Wherefore, I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little”— This is a mysterious part of the personal history of Christ— It follows immediately after the performance of many of his most stupendous miracles—the healing of the centurions servant— The raising from the dead of the widow’s son; and the answer to the messengers from John the baptist with the enquiry, art thou he that should come— After all this, a Pharisee invites him to his table—and while there; a woman, Luke says, a Sinner came in with a box of precious ointment, with which she anointed the feet of Jesus, kissing them and wiping them with her hair— The pharisee secretly taxes Jesus with keeping bad company, and of course being no prophet but an impostor. Jesus detecting his suspicions, tells him the parable of the two debtors and makes him acknowledge that the debtor to whom the most was forgiven will love the most—then compares the woman’s kindness to him with that of the pharisee himself; declares that of the woman much the best; and then because she loved much, her sins, which were many, were forgiven— Here are many sins forgiven for personal adulation; and the kindness of the pharisee roughly buffeted because it was not so obsequious as that of the woman— The other three Apostles tell the story with entirely different circumstances.— With them Simon is not a pharisee, but a leper— The woman is Mary, the sister of Martha and of Lazarus.— She is not mentioned as a sinner, nor are her sins forgiven; but Judas the Traitor, blames her for wasting the precious ointment, and she is justified by Jesus— This Mary passes somewhat dubiously for Mary Magdalen, but Luke does not name her. Mr Lunt was severe upon the pharisee. So is Massillon— I do not exactly see why— Mr Lunt administered the communion, and prayed for Mrs Lee, who died of a Typhus fever this afternoon. She was the daughter of the late Mrs Anthony W. Baxter who died last Winter. A family sadly broken up— Mr Lunt’s afternoon discourse was from 1. Thessalonians 5:23 [“]And the very God of Peace sanctify you wholly: And I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”— He detained the members of the Church and read the Letter of invitation from the church at Jamaica plains, to the ordination of Revd. Joseph H. Allen the 18th. He proposed me as the delegate to go with him which was voted. "

In the course of the morning the sky cleared away. I am compelled to surrender the hours before breakfast to my preparations for the west, with drawing them from the service of bodily exercise and planting. Yet my progress in the labour before me is so slow that I shall certainly not be ready for the pledged address at Dedham—the Lecture at Springfield and the Discourse at Cincinnati—besides the unexpected and sudden calls to speak, which keep me upon the rack— Last evening and this morning I wrote two Letters to Alexander Hay, one as chairman of a Committee of 50 citizens from a meeting of Friends of Liberty at Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, and the other as Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh—both being invitations to me to visit that place on my way to or from Cincinnati.— A gentleman beggar by the name of Francis Sanderson paid me a transient visit. Isaac H. Adams dined with us, and assisted my granddaughter Mary Louisa in making up the Memorial of my July tour to Canada, and the Falls of Niagara—in many respects the most memorable period of my life— It consists of the Newspaper reports of the complimentary receptions which I met at Saratoga—Ogdensburgh; the Falls, Buffalo, Rochester, Canandaigua, Auburn, Syracuse, Utica, Herkimer, Little-falls, Schenectady, Albany and Pittsfield; which I pray God may not have turned my head. I have gathered the articles containing the notices of my progress—the addresses made to me and my answers, and now have the slips pasted into an old book for Wedgwood’s copying press, which I have had these 50 years and never used— Among my troubles now is the multitude of Letters that I receive from day to day and have neither leisure, time, nor even often the ability to answer— This day 1. from Lysander Spooner, with a pamphlet upon Constitutional Law, relative to credit, currency and Banking. 2 From Theodore S. Fay U.S. Secretary of Legation at Berlin, 13. August 1843. with an enclosure from John D. Hiester, and 3 other papers relating to the claim of Dr Flügel, U.S. Consul at Leipzig, 3. From T. A. Howard Rockville, Indiana 23. Septr. 1843. with perplexing enquiries concerning periodical journals. Howard was a worthy democratic member of the 26th. Congress 1. Session, from Indiana. 4. From Samuel Howard, and 2 others—Committee of Clay club. N. 2 New-York, Switzerland County Indiana 12. Septr. 1843. asking my opinion on a curious contested election question. I cannot answer these Letters. I called this afternoon at Mr Josiah Brigham’s shop to see him, but he was gone to Weymouth— At my son’s request I endorsed his note for 2400 dollars. "

Mr Brigham called on me this morning and I told him that having found it necessary to set out upon my journey to Cincinnati earlier than I had intended, I wished to change the day for my address to the inhabitants of Norfolk County, and of the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts, from Thursday the 26th. of this month to Tuesday the 24th.— And I requested him to give notice of this change to the other members of the Committee; and in the Newspapers of the District, which he very cheerfully promised to do. He thought the hour we had agreed upon was 11. in the morning, and I now agreed to fix that as the hour; but 10 was the hour upon which we had agreed, and I should not have consented to change it— I have a fearful weight upon my mind to prepare at once for Dedham, Springfield and Cincinnati, to keep my Diary in the current of time, and not to neglect entirely my correspondence— I receive so many Letters, and upon subjects so multifarious, that even the memory of receiving many of them escapes me, and I propose now to endorse and file them first chronologically; and alphabetically at the close of each month— I answered last Night and this morning Letters from judge Burnet and professor O. M. Mitchel of Cincinnati; promising if practicable to reach that city by the 6th. of November; the 7th. being the day named by Mr Mitchel for the ceremony. I wrote also. 1. to John B. Kirkham of Springfield apprizing him, that the day of my departure from home is changed from the 1st. of the next to the 25th of the present month, when I hope to reach Springfield in time to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum at that place. 2. to John F. Lamb, at Frankford near Philadelphia, declining a renewed invitation to deliver a Lecture there. 3. To Charles J. Ingersoll, Philadelphia, who has twice transmitted to me these invitations to lecture at Frankford.— I return his courtesy with a lot of the same article. In political intercourse it may often be our duty to respect a man whom we cannot esteem; and in the encounter of partizan hostility we must make large allowance for the possible injustice of our own prejudices and prepossessions. I received this day Letters 1. From T. A. Howard, Rockville Indiana 23 Septr 1843. Another political adversary, asking good offices for a literary institution. Can I deny, or withhold them? 2. From T. B. Wakeman—New-York—with a printed circular notice of the 11th. annual Fair of the American Institute at New-York and a skein of black sewing silk. 3. From Albert Wright, superintendent of common schools, Washington County, New-York, 28 Septr 1843. who is to write upon physical education, and asks for my experiences— How shall I answer him?— There was this afternoon a very sudden thunder gust; and a beautiful double rainbow. Walk up the hill— Mrs Charles and the two Louisa’s. "

I devoted this day to labour and made my record of yesterday before breakfast— I thought I should have a long morning for writing, but Mr Curtis my Co-Executor of the Will of the late Ward Nicholas Boylston with Mrs Alicia Boylston his widow came, and informed me, that last Wednesday Mrs Boylston, who resides with her son at Providence Rhode-Island had a severe fit of palsy, which may be hourly expected to terminate fatally. That her right side is wholly impotent and she is speechless, though still in full possession of her mind. The event of her decease will impose upon him and me immediate and complicated duties, which will require our immediate and most assiduous attention— We read carefully the Will over together. The three Co-Executors are also constituted joint Trustees for the management of the Estate, real and personal, for the payment of sundry annuities, rents and profits, and of sundry bequests to take effect on the decease of Mrs Boylston— The Trust is almost a perpetuity, and the will requires that on the decease of either of the Trustees the survivors shall nominate a person to be appointed by the judge of Probate as the third Trustee, so that there may be always three, during the continuance of the Trust— A life estate was given to Mrs Boylston, in all the real Estate, but the moment after her decease the Trust attaches to it all. We agreed 1. That in the event of Mrs Boylston’s decease, we must immediately nominate a third Trustee for the appointment by the judge of probate, and that it shall be my Son, if he will consent. 2. That from the moment of Mrs Boylston’s decease accounts must be opened by the Trusts with all the Estates specifically devised, and with all the annuitants and beneficiaries 3.— That the option must be offered to Dr Ward Nicholas Boylston, to occupy the Princeton Estate, and to Thomas Boylston to occupy the Roxbury Estate; in which case the management of them will devolve upon themselves respectively; and if they decline occupying them they must do it in writing to be kept of record in the probate Office. 4. That an inventory should be taken of all the property, with which the Trustees will be chargeable from the day of Mrs Boylston’s decease—and a list of all the persons to whom they will have bequests or annuities to pay. 5. That they must take possession of all papers relating to the Execution of the will or the trusts, which have been hitherto in the possession of Mrs Boylston— Mr Curtis has received also from Petty Vaughan, by the Acadia, yesterday arrived one copy of the bond to be executed by us which he left with me. The other copy is to come by the Great Western. I promised to go next Monday to Boston, with an account for settlement between the Administrations of Thomas Boylston and Moses Gill, of which Mr Curtis promised to give notice to Mr George Fuller— I called at Mr Brigham’s shop, but he was gone to Boston.— I left at the Aurora Office a notice for publication to-morrow.

Though I intermitted the morning excursion before Sunrise, and devoted the whole day to labour I was yet unable to complete my record before breakfast, and then the hours slip’d away: the noon bell rang, and my page was scarcely finished when I was called to dinner. The Quincy Aurora of this day has the notice that I left at the Office yesterday, that I will address the People of the County of Norfolk and of the 8th. Congressional district of Massachusetts on Tuesday the 24th. of this Month at 10. A.M. at Dedham— There is also a separate notification by the Norfolk County Committee to the same effect— I called at Mr Brigham’s shop, and agreed with him about the hour, and said it would be important to me to come home that day to dinner to have half the day to prepare for my departure the next morning. I then called in at the Quincy Patriot Office and requested the republication in that paper on Saturday of my notification in this day’s Aurora; which was promised.— Green the Editor of the Patriot is convalescent from a Typhus fever, but was not at the office— On my way, finding the grave-yard open, I went in, and saw the improvements they are making there. A strong cemented wall, with an iron gate and railing have been recently placed as a fence fronting the road—the old tombstone of the parish ministers has been rebuilt by the Ladies of Quincy, and the range of excavated tombs, with the names of their owners is carried round 3. sides of the square— But not a trace is to be found either of John Quincy or of Anna Fiske his mother—nor of John Quincy’s wife, all my ancestors. My Son was there with Deacon Spear; consulting about some inscription; and some improvement upon the family tomb, which belonged to my father, and where his remains, and those of my mother were at first deposited— My Son came home with me, and I proposed to him in the event of Mrs Boylston’s decease, that we should nominate him for appointment by the judge of probate as the third trustee in place of Mrs Boylston, to execute the trusts created by Ward Nicholas Boylston’s Will— He asked my advice, and I advised and earnestly intreated him to accept the trust. He read over the Will and made no objection to my proposal.— He brought me a deed of a small strip of land for ten dollars to be conveyed to Ebenezer Adams, which I and my wife signed and sealed— I closed Letters to Miss Aricartha Miller at New-York, declining to deliver a Lecture; and to the Revd. Henry Jackson of New-Bedford in answer to enquiries about my eyes but I found not one half hour to write a Letter for this day— After dinner I read some pages of Bailly and some pages of Adam Smith’s History of Astronomy without ascertaining as I wanted the origin of the existing Zodiac, and Grecian Constellations— I bethought myself of Dupuis’s Origine de tous les cultes and supposing I might find there what I wanted, I borrowed the 11 volumes from the town Library and they engaged me till day light failed— Charles and his wife were here till the curfew, and I wrote till the clock struck midnight.

Another day of intense and agonizing labour dissatisfied with my own work and disheartened All confidence in myself lost and ready to despair of assistance, whence alone it can come— Major Thomas Adams came, and asked me for a Letter of introduction to governor Lincoln, whom he proposes to visit, to invite him to come and address the whigs of Quincy, upon electioneering topics. He said Mr Choate the U.S. Senator had advised him last week, at Dedham to apply to Governor Lincoln; and upon Adams’s objecting that he thought Mr Lincoln would not come, answered “yes he will.” How this came to be known to Mr Choate, he did not say; perhaps he assumed to say it without authority, to escape from the importunity of Mr Adams, to prevail on him to come and discourse electioneering politics to the whigs of Quincy. I told Mr Adams that I would give him a Letter of introduction to Mr Lincoln. Mr. Robinson the episcopal clergyman of this place, Mr Howe the Minister of that church at Roxbury, with Mrs Robinson and Mrs. Howe, with Messrs. Snow, Cutler, Bent, and another, all episcopal ministers, paid us a morning visit all together— They are here at an annual convention of ministers of that church, I believe recently instituted, and this is one of many indications of the aspiring and domineering spirit of the clergy of that church, who at this time are taking a desparate lurch backwards into the arms of the Pope— We were all invited to spend this evening at Mr Lunt’s—but my wife, Mary Catherine, her daughter Mary Louisa, and Louisa C Smith are all afflicted with severe colds, and my time is so totally absorbed in the work before me that we all sent excuses— I ransacked Goguet, Bailly and Dupuis for the origin of the Zodiac, Constellations and Milky way. I consulted also the Abbé Banier’s Mythology, and Fables of the Antients explained from history, and this reading swallowed up the day till dark— Then after half an hour for tea, I sat down by lamplight, and wrote till half past 11. wrote without intermission, driving like Jehu till the two pages for the day were completed. Trash which I shall not have assurance to deliver, and probably not even to print. Mr John A.

The whole hemisphere was covered with watery clouds, excepting a small strip of clear sky along the eastern horizon of the width of one third of the Sun’s-disk; the cloud ranging over it and bordering the horizon beneath it— The Sun was therefore about one third risen, when his first beam was visible; and when full risen the central third part of his disk shone bright, while the upper and nether sections of it were beclouded. As he rose there fell a few drops of rain which immediately held up, and a calm cloudy day succeeded till about 4. in the afternoon when it began to rain very gently and continued with light and scanty showers all the evening— Charles’s two Sons, came from school at Hingham. Isaac H. Adams was here this forenoon and my Son spent the Evening with us.— I went up the hill at Mrs Charles’s request to settle the notice to be given to William C Johnson of the time when he may expect me to arrive at Utica, on my way to Cincinnati— He had intimated a disposition to go with me, if I should desire it— Mrs Charles wrote to him about ten days since, inviting him in my name to go, and has received his answer that he will go— She is now to write to him that he may expect me at Utica on Friday the 27th. of this month, and must be ready to start with me at moment’s warning any time after Thursday the 26th. I had no interruptions this day, and yet wrote not one line of my discourse, the work that hangs most heavily on my Spirits— In the historical summary of the Science, which I have introduced into the address, I have come to the period of the Arabian Caliphs, and am preparing for the transition to the modern Astronomy to Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Galileo, Descartes and Kepler the precursors of Newton, upon all of whom I must bestow a transient glance— Smith’s History of Astronomy, furnishes some hints, but absorbs much time— For the Arabians not having Ockley’s history of the Saracens which I want, at hand I must put up with the 52d. chapter of Gibbon, which I hunted up, and pored over— I plunged also further into the turbid anti-Christian stream of Dupuis, and recurred to Dacier’s life of Pythagoras in the first volume of the Bibliotheque des Anciens Philosophes— This mass of heterogeneous reading absorbed the day, and bore with such pressure on the brain, that when evening came I was compelled by overpowering lassitude to desist—looked with my granddaughter Mary Louisa into Bode’s Uranographia for sundry stars which I see every clear morning, and which I now find are in the body of the great Bear—and lost my day. John A. Green Editor of the Quincy Patriot, told me that he attended a convention of the Liberty party last week at Dedham. That they agreed upon an address to the People, which would be published in the Patriot as it is, and that they ordered 2000 copies of it to be printed separately with my Letter to the Bangor Committee on the back of the sheet.

                "text": "8. V.15 Sunday.  Stormy Night, and day. Doctor Convers Francis, Professor of Pulpit eloquence and the pastoral care at Harvard University preached, this morning from Revelation 2.7. “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.—[”] There is something so original, in Dr Francis’s manner of treating his subject that I cannot follow the links of connection between his text and his discourse— There was commentary upon the words of the text, the meanin of which is rather obscure—he finally expounded them to mean a Message from the holy spirit to the Christian churches— The argument was intricate; and its drift not very obvious till it came suddenly to its conclusion—namely that whatever might be the doctrines preached in the name of the spirit none were genuine but such as led directly to the improvement of mankind in practical morality, virtue and benevolence— I did not expect that this would be the peculiar axiom, drawn from that text— Neither could I perceive the flaw in the thread— The first hymn which the Doctor gave out to be sung was 536. of Mr Lunt’s Christian Psalter— My hymn for sabbath morning.— There are in that collection 22. Psalms and hymns of my composition; but the exultation of heart that I felt on hearing it read and sung as a part of the devotions of the day was preposterous and I own sinful vanity. I pray God to suppress in me, all pride at any manifestations of human applause that I may have recently receive, and to dispose me in the sincerity of my Soul, to see in them only lessons of humiliation— Dr Francis dined with us and preached this afternoon, from 1. Corinthians 15.10. [“]But, by the grace of God I am what I am”; another text which I should not have selected as peculiarly copious of instruction. But perhaps the perfection of the art of preaching consists in extracting a large nut from a small shell. The Doctor’s lesson was that all Christians should consider themselves to be what they are, by the grace of God; and it is doubtless the duty and the joy of a virtuous man, to live with God always in his thoughts Dr Francis gave notice that from this time for the winter the morning hour of meeting will be half past 10. and the afternoon a quarter before 2— My most urgent labour necessarily lags behind— I consulted Sotheby’s Georgics, for the line. Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas. Tis Book 2. verse 490. "

I was able therefore to devote the morning till breakfast to the Diary, and just finished it in time— I may therefore lay it down as a general rule that rising at 4. I can close the record of the day before, to breakfast at 8. and I can do no more— But then the disposable part of the day is gone— I hoped I should have a long day for progress on the Astronomical Discourse; and leisure for my correspondence. I was bitterly disappointed— Orin P. Bacon, Postmaster at the Neponset Village with his Uncle Asa Bacon, an inhabitant of the State of Vermont, and his Son Washington Asa Bacon, a settler at Detroit in the State of Michigan, paid me, together a morning visit— I went into my garden to visit my trees and plant some whole peaches and pears, nuts and acorns, but was called back to Mr Brigham to agree upon arrangements for the meeting at Dedham this day fortnight when I am to address the People of the County of Norfolk, and of the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts— Mr Brigham will go with me—to start at 1/2 past 7. A.M—reach Dedham at 9. Hold the meeting at 10. and return home to dine immeditely after the address— We agreed also upon other details of arrangement. I went a second time into my garden and Nursery, and was recalled again to a visit from Coll. Thomas H. Perkins, and the Revd. Doctor Pierce of Brookline— A visit of courtesy and civility— Coll. Perkins is close upon four score— My acquaintance with him commenced at the ordination of Henry Ware at Hingham in September 1787. Since which he has been prosperous in life and is now one of the wealthiest men in this country— I finally planted my pears and peaches promiscuously in a row, by the gate between the garden and Nursery, but without order or selection of seeds.— The morning was gone and I was called to dinner— It was scarcely over when Mr Cummings of the Quincy Lyceum came to enquire, if I could deliver a Lecture there this day fortnight at 1/2 past 7. in the evening— I told him I was engaged to deliver a Lecture, precisely at that time, at Springfield 100 miles from this place— As there is no day between this and then, which would suit the Quincy Lyceum, Mr Cummings thanked me for my former services to them, and released me from any engagement for the present Season— My Son went to Boston, and attended the funeral of Mrs Alicia Boylston at Mount Auburn and returned home to dine— John Lane Boylston, his two sons and three daughters, and Mr. Curtis were there— The extreme pressure upon my time prevented me from attending; much to my regret— Charles brought home and gave me a Boston Morning Post of this day containing a Letter from Duff Green at London dated the 18th. of September last, somewhat concerning me, and which I am to consider whether I should notice it or not. The print being too small for my eyes, I took it, with my grand-daughter Mary Louisa into my Library, and she read it for me. "

Rising an hour later than my time, precludes the making up of my record before breakfast, and that throws it back upon the noon tide bell; and excepting the walk up hill to see the rising sun, and the visits to the wood house I superseded all athletic exercise. I received a Letter from Mr Henry Clay, with a kind and cordial invitation to Kentucky,  and to Ashland his house, on the occasion of my approaching tour to Cincinnati— And the invitation is extended equally to Mrs Adams— I receive it with a full sense of the generous and friendly feeling of Mr Clay; but under equal embarrassment whether to accept or to decline it— I had intended not to protract my journey beyond the absolute necessity required for the performance of the duty which I have engaged to perform; and that becomes more formidable as I approach the day of performance. Even now it brings me to the borders of distraction— There are numerous reasons why I should not step beyond the State of Ohio, and my deliberate judgment is that I should adhere to that determination— Yet there are considerations of great weight prompting to my acceptance of the invitations to Kentucky, and especially that of Mr Clay— I must wait for Counsel.— Deacon Spear and his son Charles were here with his brother in Law, Mr Crowell from Londonderry in New Hampshire— The Deacon left with me plans of two lots of woodland, parcels of the 600 acres and adjoining my lots there, which Mr Josiah Bass junr offers for sale—with an appraisement by Lewis Bass high above its real marketable value.— After dinner we had a visit from Mr and Mrs Loring of Hingham— Mr Loring urged me warmly to deliver an address to the whigs at Boston upon the public Lands; about which he said the People were very much in the dark.— But I have already undertaken more than I can perform.— This afternoon I undertook to gather and pack up in chests all my files of Letters received since the 3d. of March 1829. when I retired from the President’s house to Meridian hill— I packed in the rough chest received last Spring from Washington, all the files from 1829. to 1837. inclusive; and they fill the chest— They are yet not complete, and need a thorough new packing; for which I hope to have time and leisure and resolution hereafter— The files from 1838 to this time will require a second chest. Mean time my day was consumed my spirits worn out and my soul cast down to the nervous affections of second childhood— An alarm of inflammation in the eyes, suddenly supervening yesterday and this day aggravates my anticipations; and the necessity of suppressing my emotions before my family, does not alleviate them— Charles and his wife were here this evening— I gave Abby, a card portrait autograph, such as one I gave last week to Mrs Sarah Morton— I snatched a half an hour to read some pages of Dr Bowditch’s Article on Modern Astronomy, in the North American Review and wrote two pages by setting up till Midnight.

A tolerable night’s rest, that is to say of four hours dissipated most of my nervous fantasies, but not the soreness and inflammation of my eyes; but my washing and dressing with making of my fire, providing my chamber with firewood for the day, and tripping up the hill to see the sun rise occupied a large hour and a half of the morning.— The sun rose crystal clear and Charles house on the hill was surrounded by an atmosphere equally clear; while all the low lands around, and my own house were covered with a thick fog— Returning from my walk my fingers were pinched with cold so that I could not write— I read therefore, part of Dr Bowditch’s Article upon modern Astronomy in the North American Review of April 1825. without finishing it— A valuable Article to which I must if possible again recur— But this delayed my diary page of yesterday till dinner time— My wife, Louisa C. Smith, Charles and his wife went to Boston, and returned home to dine— Mean while I had visits from Mr John P. Robinson the Episcopalian Minister of Christ Church in this town; with Mr Wells, teacher of a school at South Boston and eleven of his boys— After that Friend Crane of Canton, a man born in 1776. and to whom the Christian name was given in pursuance of a resolution long premeditated by his father— He came to see me from curiosity merely. Towards Sunset Coll. Josiah Quincy junr called; having come out from Boston to look at the beautiful place which has been desolate all this summer because there is too much solitude at Quincy for his wife. His son Samuel was with him— My Son brought a bond to be given by him to the judge of probate for the county of Norfolk, and to which Mr Nathaniel Curtis are to be the sureties, and myself, upon his appointment by the judge, as the third Trustee, for the execution of the Trusts created by Ward Nicholas Boylston’s will in the place of his widow; now deceased— Charles and myself signed and sealed the bond, and Louisa C. Smith, and my son John’s widow, Mary Catherine signed as witnesses—which they did also to my execution of the two copies of the bond of indemnity and release which have been received from him recently by the Acadia and the Great Western— I continue my endeavours for the assortment of my papers; but receive daily more Letters than I am able to answer— I have this day one from S. P. Hildreth and 25. a Committee of the Inhabitants of Marietta in the State of Ohio 3. Octr. 1843. an invitation to visit that place on my tour to Cincinnati—and one from John A. Watkins, Rodney, Mississippi 19. Septr. 1843. a very earnest exhortation to me to prevail upon Congress to erect a monument to George Washington, to cost half a million of dollars.— My work upon the Astronomical Address was postponed as usual from hour to hour till after the curfew and then the heavy drowsy head and smarting eyes so languidly performed their offices that it was with extreme effort I got through one-page devoted to Kepler.

                "text": "13. IV:15. Friday.  An uninterrupted and yet an inefficient day—  Charles went to Boston and returned to dine—  Great part of the day was consumed in packing up my files of Letters from 1838 to 1842 inclusive in one of the rough hewn chests from Washington, which they fill.— All the files from 1829. to the close of the last year are now packed in these two chests but it would require a week of time to repack them in perfect order, and they might very advantageously be decimated for preservation, and nine in ten of them committed to the flames. I found upon the files sundry papers which I have long been searching for in vain Among them the bond of indemnity and release to Petty Vaughan, which has been so long missing: five of my son Charles’s quarterly accounts, and the statement of the Gill claim on the Administration of Thomas Boylston’s Estate, which I drew up in June 1839. and which had so unaccountably disappeared.— I received this day Letters 1. from Samuel N. Sweet. 7. Octr. Rochester New-York, with a narrative of my visit to Rochester, by a youth named John C. Chumasero, and some enquiry of my opinion concerning a book upon elocution of which he is the author and presented me with a copy when I was there— 2. From Hiram Teal and Co. 30 Septr. 1843. La Fayette Indiana, with enquiries concerning a petition to Congress which they say they sent to me last winter, but of which I have no recollection. 3. from Edmund Quincy, Dedham 12. Octr. an exceedingly cordial invitation to his house on the 20th. when I am to address my Constituents of the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts, in that town— 4. from the late judge John Davis. Boston 12. Octr: enquiries and remarks upon Astronomy, with much highly interesting matter— All these Letters require answers, but where shall I find to write them.— I finished reading this day Smith’s posthumous fragment history of Astronomy to the time of Newton, and Dr Bowditch’s Article on Modern Astronomy in the North American Review of April 1825.—both excellent summaries—the Article taking it up, where Smith leaves it, and the two forming together a complete and very useful abridgement of the history of the Science from its origin down to 1825.— Dr Bowditch confines himself to mere matter of fact; indulging far less in philosophical speculation than the man of Scotland.— Bowditch’s Review is precious for the selection of topics which the modern Astronomers have chiefly discussed; and for the list of the recent Astronomical writers whose works he recommends with favourable notice. Among them is a History of ancient Astronomy in 2. 4to. Volumes Astronomy of the middle ages in 1. and of modern Astronomy in 2. by Delambre which I have never seen— Charles brought me a message from Mr Nathaniel Curtis requesting me to prepare a Letter to Petty Vaughan to be sent with the bond of indemnity, by the Acadia Steamer the day of whose departure will be next Monday. I accordingly wrote the Letter. "

Saturday  The Misses Maria, and Elizabeth Rebeca Nicholson daughters of Commodore Samuel Nicholson, a naval officer of the War of Independence came from Dedham, where they reside to consult with me, concerning a claim for arrears of pay due to their father for a term of 13 Months, during which he was under arrest upon trial by a Court Martial— He was honourably acquitted of the charges, but his pay was suspended while he was under arrest and was never restored— In 1836. These Ladies petitioned Congress upon this claim Their petition was presented by William Jackson, and referred to a Committee— It was afterwards in the charge successively of John Reed and of William S. Hastings— There was another petition by their sister Mrs Rogers of New-York, for herself and them, for the same claim, and Mr Talmadge the Senator from New-York, has advocated the claim in the Senate. Theron Metcalf of Dedham drew their petition, and with it were sundry papers to support the claim which have never been returned to them— They have heard that they were mislaid and could not be found. They shewed me a copy of their petition which I read— They are I take it both of the last century and totally destitute— I advised them to prepare a new petition, referring to the former one and to the proceedings of Congress upon it. To send me the new Petition, which I promised to present and to call up the old one with its vouchers— Mr Lunt called and gave me a minute of the birth of Daniel Quincy 12 Septr. 1650. and of John Quincy, 5. April 1652 (he died 14. Augt. 1674) and of the death of Henry Adams 8. October 1646. which he took yesterday from the Boston town records. He agreed to go with me next Wednesday to the ordination of Mr Allen at Jamaica Plains— to leave here at 1/2 past 11 O’Clock A.M The council are to meet at 1 p.m. The ordination service to commence at 2. and tea after it is over— After dinner Isaac H. Adams and his Sister Mrs. Angier were here— Also Dr Fisher of Dorchester and Mr Edward Jarvis who said that they proposed to memorialize Congress, to demand a revisal of the returns of the last census especially with regard to the number of persons returned as insane. From these returns it is made to appear that there is an immense disproportion of insane persons, of the free coloured class, over every other portion of the population. The Slave-mongers are building upon it a systematic argument in support of Slavery. Mr Jarvis has published in the Boston Courier an Article, proving that the census returns have been falsified to give this appearance to the facts.— He believes that the falsification of the Document was made at the Department of State, and therefore proposes this memorial to demand the revisal of it— I told him that if they would send the memorial to me I would present it— "

Just before meeting this morning, a Card was brought to me from French’s tavern, with the name engraved on it of Aaron Ely Hovey, with the word Mrs in pencil mark prefixed to the name, and From Washington citty D.C. underneath—and on the back of the card “Please call after church. I want to see you on particular buisness” in pencil, without signature. Mr Smith, a young man recently settled as a colleague of Dr Francis Parkman in Boston was the preacher. His morning text from Romans 1.28 [“]And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.” After meeting I went over to French’s tavern, and enquired if there was a lady there who wished to see me— George French said yes, and shewed me to a chamber up two pair of stairs, where was a mean looking woman, in a decent mourning dress. To shew me who she was she exhibited two certificates of good character and conduct one by the name of Vinsen, and the other signed by a minister of a church at Saybook in Connecticut attesting her admission as a member of the church there in 1836. She then told me a long story of her living at Washington from 1822 to 1828. of her subsequent marriage with Mr Hovey and of their poverty and destitution— She wanted money.— I asked her if she lived with her husband? Sometimes.— But he had been for a long time unable to obtain employment— Did they live at Saybrook?— At Westport— I refused to give her money, with some expression of indignation that she, a member of the church should come here to demand money of me.— I asked if she had not written to me, making the same demand— She said she had. She asked if I would give her enough to pay her expenses back? I said not a cent—and left her.— When I got home I found Mr Smith the Minister and Mr Degrand from Boston, who dined with us. While we were at dinner Mr Grattan the British Consul came and took my acknowledgment of my signature and seal to the Bond of indemnity and release to Petty Vaughan. With him was Mr Reed, one of the late Commissioners from New Brunswick at the negotiation of the Ashburton Treaty— They declined staying to dine and Mr Grattan borrowed my cloak to return to Boston— Mr Smith’s afternoon text was from Hebrews 12.14. [“]Follow peace with all men, and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.”— We hand company at tea and in the evening as above in the margin— Mrs Charles gave me a note to her from Mary Ann Bigelow and I received a note in pencil from Mrs Hovey.

When I rose, the sky was beclouded with lucid spots in the East, but about five, it began to sprinkle and rained in copious showers with short intervals the whole day and evening: Fahrenheit 52. I finished my Diary minutes just in time for breakfast, and by snatching every leisure moment, wrote 3 pages of Astronomy, to make up for the lapse of the two preceding days in which I had not written a line— And I closed the day by writing an answer to Mr Henry Clay’s invitation to visit him at Ashland, his residence in Kentucky— This is I believe the maximum of performance in writing in the space of one day for the rest of my life.— But I received with the mail this morning a letter from Mr Frye to my son, which supposing it to relate to the affairs of Mr T. B. Johnson, of no urgency, I left on my table, till evening twilight came on, when I took it up the hill and delivered it— My wife on leaving Washington to come here had left in charge with Doctor Hall Mr Johnson’s attending physician, in the event of an unfavourable change in the symptoms of Mr Johnson’s disease, to have notice of it immediately conveyed to her; and Mr Frye says that Dr. Hall, in concurrence with Dr Thomas and Mrs Smith requests him to give that notice.— I received also Letters 1. from David A. Bokee and 3 others committee of the whigs of Brooklyn, who are proposing to hear a course of political lectures this Season, and invite me to deliver the introductory. 2. from John L. Sibley—Assistant Librarian of Harvard University, making enquiries concerning the books that I have given to that Library— Also concerning the books given by my father—donations, he observes which never have been sufficiently acknowledged— He enquires also concerning the titles annexed to names in the triennial Catalogues; upon which I am not well informed. 3. from Lewis Johnson, Washington 11. Octr. 1843. with an enclosure for John Otis— My daughter Mrs John Adams has undertaken to make a copy for me of the Discourse prepared for delivery at Cincinnati on the occasion of laying the corner-stone of the Astronomical Observatory at that place. I have projected an address of 48 pages which would take 3 hours in the delivery. 45 pages of it are written, and I want at least 25 more, to fill up the Outline—but I have not the time, and must close abruptly leaving perhaps the most important part of what should be said unnoticed My wife on the advices received this day from Washington, of the dangerous state of her brother, thinks of going off immediately for Washington, and if she goes, I have promised to go with her— It disconcerts all my arrangements, but duty admits of no alternative.

Clear sky—whereupon I went up the hill and saw the Sun rise, and consequently could not finish my daily record before breakfast— Calisto was perpendicular to the horizon from my Northeastern window tail downwards, Benetnasch so far above the horizon that I assume Arcturus rose at 5. but I did not see him— At 5 the dawn is so far advanced the bright stars of the Bear herself have faded almost out of sight, and those in her paws are no longer visible.— They do not indeed properly belong to the Bear any more than Asterion or Chara.— My only domestic interruption of the day was to see the disposal of 280 bottles of common claret wine from the cask purchased last week of John D and M. Williams in my cellars.— I have taken this occasion to have the cellars themselves cleared out, which was needed; and which I have too long neglected. I had upwards of 200 of the bottles of claret deposited in the arch under west-end of the house and 6 dozen in the Arch under the East-end— In the central cellar I found 5 boxes of wines brought in 1829 from Washington, and took out of one box 12 bottles of Vin de la Nerthe packed up at Tain—choice Hermitage— I must give it away. Mr Brigham called this afternoon, and enquired from the Norfolk County Committee whether I could furnish them with a copy of the address I am to deliver at Dedham next Tuesday— I told him that would be impossible— That I have little or nothing written— That I shall have time to write little or nothing, and that a great portion of my address must and will be extemporaneous— I agonize at the thought, and it haunts me day and night.— But I said I supposed there would be reporters there from the Boston Newspapers; and they must put up with their reports; for I shall not have even time to revise them— He said he believed the Committee would employ a reporter— I told him I might perhaps be obliged to go off to Washington the day after to-morrow, in which case it will be impossible for me to deliver the address at Dedham; and if it should be so, I must rely upon the Committee to give notice to the People of the District in time to save them from being disappointed— As I lost the light of day to write, I went over the hill to Mr Lunt, and notified him that I might be prevented from going with him to morrow to the ordination at Jamaica plains— My wife seems strongly inclined to go immediately to Washington; and have promised if she goes to go with her— Mr Lunt’s father was at his house— Charles and his wife and daughter Louisa were here this evening— Their boys do not go again to Hingham.— I wrote this evening till past 11. Three pages this day; and filled my 48th. page. "

Fahrenheit 32  In the Southern aspect of my front door, I took the thermometer up the hill, and at the Northwestern corner of Charles’s house as the Sun rose it stood at 28.— The average difference between the two expositions is about 4 degrees. Returning from my Sun rise walk I met Benjamin Andrews our coachman, with the morning mail from the Post Office, in his hand.— On giving me the Letters and Newspapers, he took from his pocket a Letter addressed to Charles F. Adams, which he observed was from Washington and had a black seal— The superscription being in the hand writing of Mr Frye, I opened it and found it dated the 14th. at 7. in the evening and announced that Mr Thomas Baker Johnson, my wife’s only brother died that same evening at 10 minutes before 6. and that it would be necessary to inter his remains before any of the family could reach Washington. I wrote immediately to Mr Frye, enclosing a copy of Mr Johnson’s Will, and authorising him to do every thing necessary for its execution till I come— My wife not thinking it necessary to hasten her departure for Washington, my own arrangements remain undisturbed— Mr Richardson of Braintree was here anxious about an appropriation for the Boston Custom house, to the building of which he says he and his company have delivered by contract stone to the amount of 30000 dollars, for which they are unpaid.— Mr Lunt, came before 11. and again at half past 11. and went with me to Jamaica Plains, to attend the Ordination of Joseph Henry Allen as Pastor of the third parish in Roxbury. The Council met at the village Hall at 1. O’Clock P.M. The proceedings there were short and unanimous; and at 2. they proceeded to the meeting house where the services were performed in the following order—Voluntary—Ordination—Anthem—Introductory prayer by Revd. F. T. Gray—Selections from the Scriptures by Revd F. D. Huntington—Original hymn—Sermon by Revd Joseph Allen of Northborough, father of the youth now ordained— The text was Hebrews 13.8. [“]Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to day, and forever.” Original hymn— Tune Priscilla. Prayer of Ordination by Revd. Edward B. Hall of Providence R.I. Charge by Revd. Thomas Gray D.D. the Pastor of the same church who has just resigned his office. Right hand of fellowship, by Revd. John Fothergill Waterhouse Ware of Fall river: a son of Dr Henry Ware junr. recently deceased. The address to the Society, by Revd. George Putnam of Roxbury, and the concluding prayer by the Revd. Nathaniel Hall of Dorchester— Then, what is called an Ascription sung by the choir, and the benediction by the newly ordained pastor— All the services were good and well performed— A collation at the village Hall before and after the service— No other beverage but cold water and cool tea. The services closed a quarter past 5— We had called at Dr Gray’s house. Mr Lunt came home with me. We landed at 1/2 past 6. and I wrote till 11. "

He said not, when he left Boston at Noon. While we were speaking she was landing her passengers at East-Boston wharf— Among them were Abbot Lawrence and his family— Miss Lincoln whom he left in charge of his small children whom he did not take with him was a few days since found dead in her bed. The newspapers of yesterday announce the same thing of Dr Linn, late Senator of the United States from the State of Missouri.— I received yesterday a Letter from Professor O. M. Mitchel. Cincinnati 8. October, urging for my answer to his and judge Burnet’s previous Letters of 8 September— I had answered them on the 3d. of this month—and my answer to him, with an omission of half a line, is published in this morning’s Atlas copied from a Cincinnati paper.— My answer was received on the 10th. two days after professor Mitchel had written to me to hasten it; and the Society to whom my Letters were communicated, finally fixed Thursday the 9th. of November for the ceremony instead of Tuesday the 7th. which they had first proposed— May the blessing of Heaven rest upon the destined day.— And I received this day a Letter from Louisa Staughton, Rebecca Burnet and Clarissa Davies, a Committee of Invitation of the Ladies of Cincinnati, who propose to give a Temperance tea-party, the day after the laying of the corner stone of the observatory—and they invite my attendance.— My Son came this morning with a written summary of the parts of Mr Ward Nicholas Boylston’s Will which now call for the special attention of the Executors and Trustees— The judge of probate Leland has appointed him the third Trustee, in the place of the late Mrs Alicia Boylston.— He is apprehensive that some of the provisions of the Will are susceptible of exceptionable constructions, upon which it will be necessary to have the decision of the judge of probate before responsible action— There are conditional bequests to the amount of 3000 dollars to Harvard University, and 1000 to the inhabitants of the Town of Princeton, about which Letters must be written by the Trustees, and Charles has prepared a draught of a Letter to Ward Nicholas Boylston and Thomas Boylston asking their answer in writing, whether they propose to occupy any part of the Estates respectively bequeathed for their use, as by the Will they have the option to do— I approved these drafts, and asked Charles to make out a brief minute of all the points to which the Executors must attend before I go hence.— I took to the Post-Office a Letter to Hiram Teall and Co. and worked like a pack-horse to finish the astronomical Oration without success— I found John Kirk removing the fence between the garden and Orchard— After 10. O’Clock this evening I began to write an introductory paragraph to the address which I am to deliver next Tuesday at Dedham. This is all that I shall be able to prepare for that occasion. [symbols].

The thermometer at the Northwest corner of Charles’s house, stood at the same point as at my South front door— I received this morning Letters 1. from judge Burnet. Cincinnati 11. Octr. 1843— 2. from Professor O. M Mitchel same date—informing me of the receipt of my Letter of the 3d. and of the Resolution of the Astronomical Society fixing Thursday the 9th. of November, instead of the 7th. as the day, for laying the corner stone of the Observatory. 3. from Thomas H. Sill Burgess of Erie Pennsylvania, enclosing an authenticated copy of a Resolution of the Burgess and Town Council of the borough of Erie, tendering to me the hospitality of the town, and an invitation to me to visit it, dated 14. October. 4. from J. M. Kelley, chairman of a Meeting of Citizens of Cleveland Ohio, and its vicinity, held 14. October, and enclosing copy of a Resolution adopted at that meeting, and inviting me to Cleveland, with a Resolution for the appointment of a Committee of 25 to make suitable arrangements for my reception. 5. from John Newberry. Philadelphia 18 Octr. 1843. asking for an autograph and the age of William Wirt. 6 from William Taylor. 18. Octr 1843. Lee—for an autograph. E. Price Greenleaf was here, and took from the town library some books for others which he returned— John Adams, master of a Cape Cod Coaster came to enquire concerning a claim to be repaid a sum of 90 dollars, levied upon him by the collector at Ocracoke, North Carolina, for omitting to deliver his manifesto— He had sent his claim last winter to the late Mr Burnell, who shortly before his death had written to Captain Adams that he thought there would be little difficulty in recovering the money; but it did not appear that a petition had been presented to the house— I told Captain Adams that if he would have a petition prepared and forwarded to me before the meeting of Congress, together with the document from the collector shewing that he had levied the fine, I would present the petition, and attend to it as far as I may be able— Charles went to Boston and returned to dine. I sent up the hill a box of Haut-Brion wine of the old stores from Washington in the central cellar. there remain of these only 3 boxes of Medoc St Julien, and the box from Tain. Time presses upon me like a breaking upon a wheel, and at 11. this evening I brought to a sudden and abrupt termination my astronomical discourse, 54 pages—of which I must select for delivery about one third. It is relief to me inexpressible to have got through— The undertaking was rash and presumptuous. My reputation is now staked upon it; and I pray for the blessing of fortitude to the consummation— "

The stars on the three paws of the bear visible Benetnasch pointing directly down; but no appearance of Arcturus.— Weather warm— As the Sun rose the haze of Indian Summer rose with him, and the fire in my library needed no new fuel. My astronomical discourse is finished; and I shiver at the thought of it— Minott Thayer, Asa French, and Mr Fogg of Braintree called on me this morning, and returned to me the copy of the first book of Braintree Records which they borrowed of me, two years since— They have had a copy of it made— The original second book of Braintree Records, they still retain—their copy of it not being yet finished— Mr Thayer enquired what my intention was with regard to the request of the 3 towns that I would write a history of Braintree— I told him that with the best possible intention it would be impossible for me to undertake it while I remain a member of Congress— Mr Thayer is quite discomposed at the prospect of my expedition to Cincinnati, and foresees from it nothing but disaster to myself.— He almost urged me not to go.— I told him that I had perhaps been unwise to undertake and promise it—but it was too late now to reconsider— I must go, happen what may— The Revd. Dr Storrs of Braintree, with his Son a student at the Andover theological institution, paid me a morning visit— He said some enquiries had been made of him whether among the first settlers of Braintree there was a person by the name of Cheseborough. I told him there was and shewed him the name on the record book just returned to me. He also made some enquiries concerning the first Minister of the Mount Wollaston church— Mr Ibrahim Bartlett brought me a Letter from a Lady named Sarah P. Hosford, with a manuscript in folio sheets of Essays in verse and prose, sufficient for a thick octavo volume; upon which in very complimentary verse and prose, she solicits my critical judgment to determine her whether to revise the work for the press or not.— These visits occupied nearly the whole morning.— Charles brought me a whole set of my accounts, which I have now no time to examine. At Sunset I walked up the hill for half an hour. Charles his wife and daughter spent the evening here— I employed all the leisure of the day until close upon midnight in writing an introductory preamble to my proposed address to my constituents, to be delivered next Tuesday at Dedham. The first of the new trials that await me. "

[“]But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith.”— The discourse was a commentary—upon the Spirit, as producing the blessings enumerated, one by one in succession, dwelling much upon the spiritual character of Christianity contrasted as it is in the context with the works of the flesh, and of the law, that is the Levitical Law.— This contrast is very remarkably set forth in the chapter from which the text is taken, and towards the close of his sermon, Mr Lunt adverted with great severity to the doctrines which represent the Creator of the universe as a cruel unrelenting tyrant making the race of man not for happiness, but for misery— His text in the afternoon was from 1. Samuel 30.24—“but as his part is, that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.” I scarcely know how he brought this text to bear upon the excellence of Christianity; but upon whatever text Mr Lunt preaches, his argument always drifts into that the excellence of Christianity— His mind is copious of details, but not rich in variety of first principles. His sermons are almost always fitted to one frame, like the holy families of the Italian painters— I had counted upon the remnant of this day after meeting to write the peroration of my address at Dedham—as I wrote the exordium last Night. These two parts being all that I can prepare, and these being now excessively hurried— But I was scarcely seated at my table when I was called to two men from Watervil in the State of Maine, named Doolittle and Savage. Their only object was to see me as a curiosity—and they were scarcely gone, when Mr De Grand came in from Boston and spent the Evening with us. He said that the Bank of England was every now and then in trouble—very much embarrassed to make good its payments. That he knew the cause of this, and the remedy; and in an hour’s conversation with Sir Robert Peel could put him in possession of a plan which would avert any such danger forever. He only wanted such an introduction to him as would induce Sir Robert Peel to listen to him one hour, and he could do no other than adopt his plan, and would pay him largely for it— And he asked if I would give him a Letter of introduction to Sir Robert Peel. I answered that my acquaintance with Sir Robert Peel was not sufficient to authorise me to give Letters of introduction to any one— Degrand is crazy. "

Spooner.— At Charles’s Office were Mr Nathaniel Curtis, and the two Sons of John Lane Boylston Ward Nicholas and Thomas.— The Trustees signed, and delivered to each of them a Letter offering him the power to occupy, Ward the Estate at Princeton, and Thomas, any part of the Estate at Roxbury, as directed by the Will— Ward desired to make enquiries what was the meaning of the word occupy, and Thomas took time to consider.— The Trustees signed also the Letters, prepared by my Son, to the President and fellows of Harvard University, to the selectmen of Princeton; to John Lane Boylston, and to his three daughters, Alicia, Mary Hallowell, and Louisa Catherine Adams Boylston, Advising each of the bequest to each of them, which took effect on the decease of Mrs Alicia Boylston I then called at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s house and saw Mrs Lawrence and Miss Anna their daughter. He was not at home— They have just returned from their Summer visit to England— At one, from Charles’s Office to Quincy— After dinner, Mr Samuel C. Mann of Dedham came and mentioned that on my way to Dedham to morrow morning a cavalcade escort would meet me at Paul’s bridge— Mr Robinson and Mr Vinson were here— Mr Vinson proposes to keep a school next Summer at Quincy Point.

Howard had been one of the first persons to greet us on our arrival— We took tea at his house.— His family consists of two daughters both invalids, one particularly in appearance healthy and handsome, but threatened with blindness.— At half past six we repaired to a meeting house, and I read my Lecture on Society and civilization—from a Stage in front of the pulpit, before a table with four wax candles— I read the manuscript with great difficulty and frequent hesitation— A crowded house, and listening auditory, an hour and a half.

It was the same country through which I had passed last July, with so many flattering testimonials of kindness and regard by the inhabitants— My passage now is silent and unnoticed— It is known only to Mr Johnson of Utica and his family that I am upon this road— At Geneva we found William Clarkson Johnson waiting for us, and he came on with us.

The room in which I slept was so small, so cold and so dark, that they gave me another this morning, very comfortable, the same in which I had slept last July. Immediately after breakfast, Mr Thompson, Dr John’s and Mr Dobbins called on me, and informed me, that they together with Mr Hunter and General Charles M Read, member of Congress elect from the Eri District of Pennsylvania, had been appointed a Committee by the inhabitants of the borough to invite me to visit them on my way to Cincinnati—which invitation I accepted and it was agreed that we should embark at 8. O’Clock to morrow morning in the Steamer Genl. Wayne in which those gentlemen had come down to meet me— Mr Fillmore immediately after came in and invited us to tea at his house this evening, and offered us seats in his pew at the unitarian church which we accepted. The preacher was Mr Hosmer and his text was from Matthew 6.31. “What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? Or, wherewithal shall we be clothed?” He left out the preceding words of the verse [“]Therefore, take no thought saying” so that the Sermon was not directly upon the negative precept, but upon the anxious cravings of mankind for the supply of these wants incident to their physical nature— The discourse was an earnest and affectionate exhortation to the auditory not to indulge this excessing anxiety for the necessaries of life, but to guard against them by industry moderation and frugality and most especially by suppressing their propensities to lavish and extravagant expense, which he denounced as the besetting sin of the age and especially of the place.— An excellent and eminently practical Sermon.— Mr Hosmer gave notice that the anniversary festival of the protestant reformation would be held this evening. I observed that the usage of the worshipers here is to be seated during prayer, and to stand at the singing of the hymns. They use the compilation of the late Dr Greenwood— We dined at the Hotel and by invitation of Mr Rogers attended the evening service of the episcopal church: where a stranger, read prayers for the 20th Sunday after Trinity and Mr Hawkes, the settled minister was the preacher— His text and his sermon have slipped from my memory, which is the fault not of his mediocrity, but of my lethargy. Mr Hawkes is a young man, a brother of the celebrated Dr Hawkes; and married a sister of Mrs Edward Stanly. Returning from church I met in the street my old friend Albert H. Tracy, and was visited at the hotel by Lieutt. Williams the engineer, and others— We attended a tea and evening party at Mr Fillmore’s— Mr Love having insisted that I should first stop in at his house where his eldest daughter sung and played on the Piano the old armed Chair— Conversation with Tracy— "

                "text": "2. IV— VI.30. Thursday  I came on board of the Canal Packet boat Rob-Roy, yesterday very unwell with my catarrh hoarseness and sore-throat, and some fever. this boat is 83 feet long, 15 feet wide, and has besides the persons here named about 20. other passengers— It is divided into 6 compartments; the first in the bow with two settee beds for the ladies, separated by a curtain from a parlors bedchamber, with an iron stove in the centre and side settees, on which four of us slept feet to feet.— then a bulging stable for four horses two and two by turns and a narrow passage with a side settee for one passenger to sleep on, leading to the third compartment a dining hall and dormitory for 30 persons; and lastly a kitchen and cooking apparatus with sleeping room for cook, steward and crew, and necessary conveniences. So much humanity crowded into such a compass was a trial such as I had never before experienced, and my heart sunk within me, when squeezing into this pillory I reflected that I am to pass 3 nights and 4 days in it.— We came on board the boat at 2. O’Clock the time when she was to depart, but it was 4. before she left the wharf.— We were obliged to keep windows of the cabins closed against the driving snow, and the stoves heated with billets of wood made the rooms uncomfortably warm. It was a comfortless evening, but before its close I found that our fellow travellers who shared the after cabin with us were well bred persons, and pleasant companions— Mr John B. Macy resides at Cincinnati. His brother Francis at Portsmouth Ohio. His daughter Charlotte, a handsome and amiable young woman from 17 to 20, and Miss Langdon of Buffalo, from 25 to 30. with fascinating manners substitutes for beauty relieved the tediousness of the evening. Mr Russell, grandfather of Charlotte Macy was also of the company, and Mr Chamberlin a young man who had met me at Cleveland with an invitation from the inhabitants of Akron to me to visit that place— About 11. O’Clock I took to my settee bed, with a head ache, feverish chills, hoarseness, and a sore throat and my tussis senilis in full force. After a restless, sleepless night, I rose twice; first at 4 and again at half past 6.— As soon as day-light came I was taken in a carriage to a hotel, where we had a plentiful breakfast. I was then taken again in a carriage to the town hall, where I was addressed, and answered by a short speech after which I shook hands with the men, women and children. Among the women, a very pretty one, as I took her hand kissed me on the cheek. I returned the salute on the lip, and kissed every woman that followed; at which some made faces, but none refused.— We returned to the boat, and continued all day our progress through the canal at the rate of about 2 miles and a half an hour— I was able to occupy part of the day morning and afternoon with writing in this diary— There was snow great part of the day—no encouragement to open the windows or to view the country through which we pass.

Mr Sloane called on me this morning, and two or three others with whom I walked round the city and they pointed out to me, the public buildings— The hospitals for the sick—the blind, the deaf and dumb—and the penitentiary. We had also a fair view of the City, and surrounding country from the top of the Neil hotel. At 11. O’Clock Mr R. W. M’Coy called and accompanied us to the Presbyterian church where Dr Hogue discoursed as I thought I heard him say from Psalm 21.1.2. but on recurring to the bible I find that was not the text.— Of the sermon I have no recollection— There was nothing memorable in it— The house was heated by a furnace, and the atmosphere produced upon me a state of apathy and drowsiness, which suspended my attention and memory in somnolency. Dr Hogue is a presbyterian preacher of the last century; has been settled here 35 years, and is more acceptable to his people the older he grows.— After dinner I attended at the episcopal church and heard Mr Dobb from 2. Timothy 4–7. [“]I have fought a good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the faith. 8 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all then also that love his appearing.” Mr Dobb is quite a young man and his style of preaching bears the episcopal stamp— His sermon was a panegyric of St. Paul— He had read the Evening service for the 21st. Sunday after Trinity.— From the close of the afternoon public worship, until 11 this evening a succession of visitors disposed of my time— My catarrhal cough is returning upon me severely. The three members of the Astronomical Society of Cincinnati, who went to meet us at Cleveland and came back to meet us here are persons of great respectability, and in their attentions to me, full of kindness. Mr Greene is a lawyer of Cincinnati; a native of Rhode-Island, son of Ray Greene heretofore a Senator of the United States, from that State—appointed by my father judge of the U.S. District Court, in Rhode-Island, and disappointed by Jefferson who withheld his Commission and appointed another man. Among our visitors, one of the most attentive is Mr Jesse B. Thomas, heretofore U.S. Senator from the State of Illinois, but now a Citizen of the State of Ohio, residing about 20 miles distant from Columbus, whence he came for the sole purpose of meeting me— Mr Sloane and Mr Ridgway areunremitting in their good offices.

Thursday  I rose again at four, and before breakfast, finished the address to be delivered at the laying of the corner stone— A succession of visitors, invitations and deputations ensued till ten O’Clock when a dense crowd of people gathered in the Street fronting the Henry house, and the procession of the members of the Astronomical Society was formed— An open Barouche with four horses was at the door; into which I entered with judge Burnet the President of the Society, Professor O. M. Mitchel, and. This was followed by other Carriages, an escort of Military companies with a band of music, and an innumerable crowd of people. As we entered the Carriage it began to rain, and we were obliged to raise the sides over our heads for shelter, and exclude the sight of me from the people and of the people from me— The procession marched round sundry streets, the rain increasing till it poured down in torrents. Yet the throng in the Streets seemed not at all to diminish— It looked like a sea of mud— The ascent of the hill was steep and slippery for the horses, and not without difficulty attained— The summit of the hill was a circular plain of which the corner stone was the centre. At the circumference, a stage was erected from which my discourse was to have been delivered; but the whole plain was covered with an auditory of Umbrella’s instead of faces. It was then determined that the discourse should be delivered to morrow morning in the Westleyan Methodist chapel, and the corner stone now laid; which ceremony I performed; and read the address which I had written last evening and this morning, to which the circle of hearers gathered around responded by three hearty cheers— My manuscript was so defaced by the rain, that it was scarcely illegible— The procession then dispersed and the Barouche returned and landed me at the Henrie house, leaving the only part of the ceremony important to me still to be performed— In the evening there was a temperance tea-party given by the Ladies of Cincinnati, and to which I had been invited by Mrs Burnet, Mrs Staughton and Mrs. Beecher.— It was held in a large theatre into which an old dwelling house of judge Burnet had been turned. I walked to it with judge Burnet, between a double line of a torch light procession of firemen— Mr John C. Wright addressed me and presented me to the assembled Ladies— I answered.— Mr Bellamy Storer made a flowery speech, and Dr. Beecher closed with a benediction. There was a sort of subterranean conveyance to the supper room which was crowded. I walked home with Mr Wright. "

Jones, one of the members of the Committee of the Astronomical Society who went to meet me at Cleveland and returned to Columbus where we met— Mr Greene walked with me to his house, which is handsome and furnished with elegance without ostentation— His wife is a handsome, middle aged woman of plain unaffected manners, and they have a graduation of seven fine boys, with a very likely prospect of having seven more—a party of ten or 12 of Mr Jones’s friends partook with us of the breakfast— I returned to the Henrie house whence at 10. O’Clock the procession of the Astronomical Society went to the Westleyan Methodist chapel, the largest church in the City— There, after a fervent prayer by Dr Wilson, judge Burnet delivered an address of about half an hour’s duration; with some enlargement of the copy which he communicated to me at Lebanon— After a very brief action of thanks to him and to the Society for this address, I delivered about one half of the Oration which I had written, and it was well received. The house was full and overflowing— I spoke nearly two hours, without a symptom of impatience or inattention of the Auditory.— Resolutions of thanks to me and to judge Burnet were adopted by the Astronomical Society with requests of copies for publication—and a Resolution that the Observatory hill should henceforth be called Mount Adams.— I then shook hands with the members of the Astronomical Society, and all others in the church who desired it and returned to the Henrie house— A crowd of visitors followed— Governor Moorhead and Mr Southgate, gave me urgent invitations to visit Covington, which I promised to do next Monday morning— Mr Rariden with a large deputation from Wayne County Indiana, personally and in writing gave me an earnest invitation on there. Governor Hendricks gave me a separate call— Deputations from Louisville and Lexington Kentucky came also. A Sub-committee from a Committee of 15 of the coloured people came and enquired when I would receive them and I appointed to morrow at 10. We dined at Mr John G. Pendleton’s with a party of about 20. A splendid entertainment in the highest style— Mr Pendleton lives in princely State He has two daughters married, and several Sons— Mrs Pendleton is a second wife; very handsome, and many years younger than he. At 7 in the evening we returned again to the Henrie house and thence, with Mr Walker, an impromptu acquaintance, to the Theatre in the midst of the performance of the Comedy of London Assurance— After hearing part of two acts without understanding the plot of the play, we retired and went to a Ball at Mr Springer’s an opulent Citizen of Cincinnati— The Ball was splendid—the banquet sumptuous and temperate and the company genteel and lovely— Thus closes, blessed be God one memorable day of my life "

They have seven children; 5 sons and 2 daughters The party at breakfast was 15 and numerous visitors, chiefly ladies came to meet us there— Professor Mitchel shewed me a Volume just received of the observations at the imperial Observatory at Vienna— Also a large transparency on a paste-board tablet, representing the planet Saturn, as seen magnified through a large telescope— He said he had a number of these transparent tables and called them his telescope— That he had exhibited them at his astronomical Lectures to the great delight of crowded auditories, and that they were the exciting causes of the enthusiasm which led to the formation of the Society, and to their undertaking to erect the Observatory here— Returning to the Henry house at 10. O’Clock I received the large Committee of 15 of the coloured people of Cincinnati— A young mulatto, son of a wealthy Virginia planter, but bearing the name of his negress mother Langston, addressed me in their name in a speech of about 15 minutes, which I answered in 8. or 10.— My answer was unpremeditated but Edward Cranch who was present reported it in substance correctly for the Cincinnati Atlas, a daily Newspaper— This over I went to the exhibition of the horticultural Society accompanied by their President Mr Buchanan. The Show of Apples was very fine—that of pears good, but with little variety—grapes next to nothing— Shagbark nuts indifferent— No others— Native wines, much like Adlum’s, though I was told that judge Burnet makes a thousand barrels of wine a year— The exhibition of flowers was dreary. Our next movement was to the house of Mr Longworth, the wealthy patron of the Arts—of Powers and Clevenger, and of the projected Observatory, any deficiency of the funds for the establishment of which by the contributions of others he has promised to supply. We saw at his house a marble bust of Genevra by Powers—a large picture of Laertes with the dead body of Ophelia, by West. A copy of the Matron of the chair, and sundry other pictures— A bouquet of flowers was presented to me by a Lady at the horticultural exhibition, and an assortment of fine apples with some nuts were sent to me by the President Mr Buchanan— At 12 I attended a meeting of the Bar of Hamilton County, at which judge Este delivered a highly complimentary address which I answered off hand as desparation dictated— Mr Southgate of Covington was there— Dinner given by the members of the bar at 3. judge John C. Wright presided— Toasts— Speech by judge Burnet— My Answer— Bellamy Storer— Retired early— Gave professor Mitchel my two manuscripts of the oration. "

Thursday Night he asked leave to sleep on a Settee in my Bed chamber, to which I readily assented Friday, they gave him a chamber and a bed, but he was taken suddenly very ill in the Night— When I went out to Breakfast he had not come into my chamber but I knew not he was sick, till on returning to receive the deputation from the coloured people, I found him lying on the settee, and on enquiry, he told me he was very sick— I requested that a physician might immediately be sent for, which was by the care of Mr Grinnell and W. C. Johnson, done; and the Doctor ordered him to bed and blistered him— This morning I went to his chamber to see him, but he was asleep, and this afternoon he was out again, convalescent— It was a slight attack of Cholera morbus— We had been invited to breakfast this morning with Mr Guilford a respectable merchant who has two beautiful daughters— We declined the invitation, but visited him on our way with Mr Greene to the Unitarian Church— This can indeed scarcely be called a church— The person officiating is a young man names James H. Perkins, a son of Samuel G. Perkins of Boston He had neither the dress nor the deportment of a Minister of the gospel. He read a few of the prayers of the Boston Stone chapel liturgy— Gave out to be sung two hymns of Greenwood’s collection, and without naming a text, delivered a short extemporaneous discourse on the Reverence due to great men.— He was very short, and announced that he would this evening deliver a discourse on the character of Michaël Angelo— From the church we went immediately to a cold dinner at judge Burnet’s— Mrs Burnet is an elderly Lady, very intelligent and evidently an excellent housewife— They have several children, all grown up and live in a Style of elegance without ostentation— One married son, lives with them. A beautiful marble bust of him—by Powers is in the parlour. After dinner we walked round and viewed the rising marble walls of a Roman catholic cathedral.— We then went to the Presbyterian Church and heard Dr Lyman Beecher preach from Psalm 17.19.— We went home, and soon out again to tea, at Mr Edward Cranch’s— Here we met Mr Wood, his wife’s mother, his wife’s sister, and several other Ladies, and Mr Walker. After tea, we went again to the unitarian church, and heard Mr Perkins’s discourse on the character of Michael Angelo; who he said was a protestant Saint— And he announced that the Lecture next Sunday Evening would be on the character of Sir Thomas More. The other services of the evening were like those of the morning.— Edward Cranch sent me the numbers of the Cincinnati Atlas for the week— He has reported in them all my ex tempore’s; a precious collection of nothing.— The last English Steamer arrived at Boston, brings Daniel O’Connell’s answer to a Slavish Address of Irish repealers at Cincinnati.

I have one of the State rooms in the Lady’s cabin for my bed chamber; but it is scarcely ten feet square in size, and has two beds, one of which is occupied by Benjamin.— The Night was nearly sleepless, and I was of course unfitted through this day for reading. I had received warm invitations from Maysville Kentucky, and from Portsmouth Ohio to visit them and receive a welcome.— Immediately after breakfast this morning, we reached Maysville 65 miles from Cincinnati— On landing, we proceeded with a dense crowd of people to a hotel where we breakfasted again, and then repaired with the Mayor and a large deputation of the citizens to the Methodist Church. There, I was welcomed to the city and introduced to the people in a highly complimentary address by the Mayor, which I answered, and as I had done at Covington, included in my remarks a just tribute of respect to Mr Clay. And here I solemnly declared that the charges of corrupt bargaining which had been trumped up against him and me were utterly without foundation. There has been a cordiality in my reception at Covington, and here, not surpassed even at Cincinnati But the impulse is from the friends of Mr Clay, and all the affectionate part of these caresses are meant for him— The mayor thanked me warmly for my answer and requested me at my leisure to furnish him with a copy of it for publication— I met here Mr Landaff W. Andrews, a member of the last Congress from this District but who failed to obtain a re-election— Also Mr William Russell, late member from the Portsmouth District, Ohio; who came with a deputation from Portsmouth to accompany me thither.— I reimbarked, after shaking hands with all the People at the Church, and parted from Maysville, with firing of guns, ringing of bells, waving of handkerchiefs and huzza’s. Idle morning.— I sought an hour of repose on my bed, during which a Steamer from Pittsburgh passed by us, and saluted with 3 cheers— At 1/2 past 3. p.m. we reached Portsmouth 55 miles from Maysville, and went again through the same ceremony— A procession to a market house, where the women were within the house and the men without, where on a Platform between the two, Mr Peck read me an address of three long pages, to which I gave a short answer.— After the shaking of hands we returned in procession to the Steamer. Here Coll. Anderson, Mr J. P. Macy, Mr William Russell, and the deputation left us— We have numerous fellow passengers, men and women— I passed great part of the day in the Lady’s cabin to which men are here admitted. Of the passengers in the Lady’s cabin, are Mr and Mrs Hamilton, of hanging rock— Mrs Stillwell from Vicksburg where her husband remains— She is going to Philadelphia— Miss Mary Emma Rhey of Pittsburgh, with her brother and Miss Amanda M’Eleavey of Newcastle Pennsylvania 25 miles from Pittsburgh— With these Ladies, Mr Johnson soon made us familiar by whist parties, and Miss M’Eleavy, a beautiful girl of about 20, observing me dispirited, came and sat down by me at my request and cheered me with several delightful songs— "

I have one of the State rooms in the Lady’s cabin for my bed chamber; but it is scarcely ten feet square in size, and has two beds, one of which is occupied by Benjamin.— The Night was nearly sleepless, and I was of course unfitted through this day for reading. I had received warm invitations from Maysville Kentucky, and from Portsmouth Ohio to visit them and receive a welcome.— Immediately after breakfast this morning, we reached Maysville 65 miles from Cincinnati— On landing, we proceeded with a dense crowd of people to a hotel where we breakfasted again, and then repaired with the Mayor and a large deputation of the citizens to the Methodist Church. There, I was welcomed to the city and introduced to the people in a highly complimentary address by the Mayor, which I answered, and as I had done at Covington, included in my remarks a just tribute of respect to Mr Clay. And here I solemnly declared that the charges of corrupt bargaining which had been trumped up against him and me were utterly without foundation. There has been a cordiality in my reception at Covington, and here, not surpassed even at Cincinnati But the impulse is from the friends of Mr Clay, and all the affectionate part of these caresses are meant for him— The mayor thanked me warmly for my answer and requested me at my leisure to furnish him with a copy of it for publication— I met here Mr Landaff W. Andrews, a member of the last Congress from this District but who failed to obtain a re-election— Also Mr William Russell, late member from the Portsmouth District, Ohio; who came with a deputation from Portsmouth to accompany me thither.— I reimbarked, after shaking hands with all the People at the Church, and parted from Maysville, with firing of guns, ringing of bells, waving of handkerchiefs and huzza’s. Idle morning.— I sought an hour of repose on my bed, during which a Steamer from Pittsburgh passed by us, and saluted with 3 cheers— At 1/2 past 3. p.m. we reached Portsmouth 55 miles from Maysville, and went again through the same ceremony— A procession to a market house, where the women were within the house and the men without, where on a Platform between the two, Mr Peck read me an address of three long pages, to which I gave a short answer.— After the shaking of hands we returned in procession to the Steamer. Here Coll. Anderson, Mr J. P. Macy, Mr William Russell, and the deputation left us— We have numerous fellow passengers, men and women— I passed great part of the day in the Lady’s cabin to which men are here admitted. Of the passengers in the Lady’s cabin, are Mr and Mrs Hamilton, of hanging rock— Mrs Stillwell from Vicksburg where her husband remains— She is going to Philadelphia— Miss Mary Emma Rhey of Pittsburgh, with her brother and Miss Amanda M’Eleavey of Newcastle Pennsylvania 25 miles from Pittsburgh— With these Ladies, Mr Johnson soon made us familiar by whist parties, and Miss M’Eleavy, a beautiful girl of about 20, observing me dispirited, came and sat down by me at my request and cheered me with several delightful songs— "

Wednesday  My cough, disables me for sleeping, almost the whole night— I had retired to bed at 1/2 past 9 last evening— At one this morning I awoke, and had no prospect of further sleep till day-light—nor then— So I rose—dressed myself and found in the Lady’s cabin, a table and candles, which enabled me to write—and I wrote accordingly till 4— I have fallen in spite of every possible exertion eight days in arrear upon this journal, and must recover them by short minutes kept from day to day— At 4 I returned to bed, and lay without sleeping till six— They breakfast on board the boat at seven— It rained almost the whole of this day—confining us to the cabin, and depriving us of the sight of most of the views on the river— Our course up the river is as follows—  We passed by Galiopolis about 4 this morning, without seeing it, and reached Marietta, at half past 3 this afternoon. I had received invitations to visit Marietta, and landed there with the usual demonstrations of welcome, a great crowd of people—guns fired; bells rung and a procession to the presbyterian church, where an address of welcome was read by judge Putnam a son of General Rufus Putnam— In my answer, referring to the interest I had always taken in the city of Marietta, I related the incident of my visit to the Revd. Manasseh Cutler at his house in Ipswich hamlet, after his return from his visit to Marietta in 1788. and of my conversation with him concerning the Western Country at that time. And I said that from the time of that conversation, I had taken a deep interest in the whole West and watched its progress step by step to its present great and flourishing condition— These remarks were received apparently with lively satisfaction, and the shaking of hands, was with a heartier squeeze than almost anywhere else. After this ceremony, I took a short ride round the city, to visit the remarkable Indian Mounds in this place— There is no tradition indicating when, or by whom or for what purpose they were constructed, but they are very extensive and the central mound is about forty feet high, two hundred feet square at the base, and one hundred at the top, perfectly formal in its symmetry— There is an Article upon these works, by Dr Manasseh Cutler, in the first volume of the transactions of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. When we returned to the Steamer, a committee of 3 members, Ephraim Cutler Caleb Emerson, and Joseph Barker embarked with us to accompany us to Pittsburgh.— We became acquainted with more of our fellow passengers— Mr and Mrs Rogers with a boy of 10 or 12 years, and Mrs Harper of Baltimore— Cards— Whist— I left the table to converse with the Committeemen from Marietta.

Denny, Bakewell, Eichbaum, Darragh and Stevens came, on board to meet us.— As we passed by Wheeling a gun was fired from our boat, and returned from the shore— There had been talk at Wheeling of inviting me to the place and giving me a reception— Many persons wished it and many thought an invitation had been sent to me but there was none— We passed equally by Steubenville in Ohio, and Beaver in Pennsylvania without notice.— The deputation from Pittsburgh had expected our arrival there to morrow morning, and all the arrangements had been made for a magnificent reception at that time Among the rest all the fire company association had held meetings and passed sundry Resolutions for having a grand display of their own; and Mr Brentlinger, as a deputation a copy of their Resolutions one of which was that I should be conducted to some public building where I was to be addressed in their name, and should be requested to deliver an Oration— And a temperance association, not to be behind hand with the firemen, had held meetings, and chosen a deputation to invite me to deliver an Oration upon Temperance— I delivered to Mr Brentlinger an answer declining to pronounce the Oration to the Firemen. I shall take the same course with the Temperance association— The Pittsburgh deputation were sadly disconcerted at our arrival before the time, and seriously proposed that we should land at Rapps settlement of Economy, pass the night there, and proceed to Pittsburgh to morrow in another Steamer to be sent down for us. But this project was abandoned, and at half past 3 in the afternoon we landed at Pittsburgh There was a considerable crowd of People assembled on the wharf to whom from the Steamer Mr Harmar Denny introduced me by name, and who received me with 3 cheers.— The Mayor of the City Mr Alexander Hay came on board to meet me, and at my own request, walked with me to the Exchange Hotel, followed by the crowd who were notified that the Procession and Reception would take place, to morrow morning, as it was regulated by the programme published in the newspapers of this day.— The multitude then after three cheers dispersed; but individuals were pressing in the whole evening. We had pressing Letters from Mr M’Kennon of Washington Pennsylvania, and from Mr Andrew Stewart of Uniontown, to know the precise moment when we shall arrive at those places. We first determined to go on Saturday to Washington; and on Monday to Uniontown; but on remonstrances from Mr Denny we concluded to remain over the Sunday at Pittsburgh, and to go on Monday to Washington, on Tuesday to Uniontown, and we wrote accordingly— Wednesday to Cumberland— Thursday home.

Debellare superbos— There is a special Providence in the fall of a Sparrow; and were it not itself arrogant self-sufficiency in me to believe, I should believe that this special Providence comes to pass for the chastisement of my pride and Vanity— The Scene of laying the corner Stone of the Astronomical observatory last week at Cincinnati, has been repeated with still more mortifying circumstances this day at Pittsburgh.— That Pageant was intended to promote the cause of Science in the minds of the People— It had a moral purpose—an important end to the attainment of which I heartily concurred— Had the day passed off successfully and without accident, the impression left on the minds of the Spectators and hearers would have been favourable to the accomplishment of the undertaking and honorary to me— The inexorable rain was literally a flood of cold water poured out on the whole ceremony. All was disappointment— But my duty and the purpose of the Society in their invitation to me were performed.— The Corner Stone of the Astronomical Observatory was laid, with supplication by me to the throne of Heaven that the erection of the building may be conducive to the improvement of the condition of man upon Earth— It is not for man to exult, even in his good intentions— It is his duty to bear disappointment, even of the best purposes with resignation and equanimity— The pageant of this day was of no earthly importance. It was ostensibly all honorary to me.— I had been invited by the city authorities to visit the city on my way to or from Cincinnati, and it was a reception— A large procession, at the head of which I was exhibited in a barouche with four handsome horses, accompanied by the Mayor of the City Mr Hay. Mr Harmar Denny and Mr Richard Biddle, started from the Exchange Hotel where we lodge, with military companies, martial music, and all the companies of the fireman’s association, in their respective showy and variegated uniforms, traversed through the abundant mud streams all the principal Streets of the City, with an heavy drenching rain pouring down all the time— We returned to the same Exchange, whence from an open balcony, Mr M’Candless delivered by heart the welcoming address of which he had sent me a copy. My answer was very short, apologizing for having come before the time, and declaring my unwillingness to detain them in the rain.— The procession then terminated; the crowd dispersed; but came up in squads to my chamber to shake hands with me through the whole day.

I had renewed applications yesterday from the fireman’s association, who had determined at all events to have their torch light procession, and equally resolved to have an Oration from me; but I again declined— I did the same with the Temperance association, at the head of whose deputation judge Wilkins made the application to me. Judge Wilkins is a member of the approaching Congress elect, and told me he would leave home on Monday for Washington, and offered me a seat in his carriage which I declined for the engaments to visit Mr M’Kennon and Mr Stewart. I also received yesterday a large deputation from the Liberty party with an address and a request that I would meet, and address them.— This I declined on the ground of having been invited here, by the concurrence of all parties, I am interdicted from discoursing upon topics of deep party feeling—but in a speech of about 20 minutes, I gave my opinions without reserve on all the Slavery questions now in agitation— One of the members of the deputation brought me this day, a meagre and most imperfect abstract of part of my speech which he proposes to publish as a report of the speech. I reminded him of several most important omissions; and there were others which I did not notice— I received yesterday and this day, Letters informing me of my election as an honorary member of the Webster and Tilghman Literary Societies; to which I answered by Letters of acceptance— We had last evening a very elegant party and supper at Mr Harmar Denny’s— This morning I wrote from the time of rising until 8. upon my journal; and immediately after, with Mr Denny, Mr Biddle and Mr Grinnell I crossed the Monongahela, in the ferry boat, and visited Mr Lorenz’s Ironworks, and another establishment, where we saw the process of rolling and hammering iron—and the work of the red hot ball, hammered into a bloom, and the blast— Thence recrossing the river we ascended to the top of the Court house whence beautiful prospects were in view. The junction of the Monongahela and Allegany rivers—the Allegany city itself, and the hills all around Our next visit was to Captain Howard and the Iron ship on the Stocks which he is building for the Government— We saw one of the ribs of the ship fashioned from the Anvil— Thence we rode out to the U.S. Arsenal, about 3 miles from the City where we were received and temperately entertained by Captain and Mrs Harding The River Allegany flows beautifully in front of the building, and there is Washington’s Island.— I thought of my lamented nephew, Lieutt. T. B. Adams who was stationed three years. Returning to Pittsburgh, we visited the cotton factory of Mr Bakewell, and saw the spinning jennies, and heard the rattling of the spindes and the looms— Returned to the Exchange hotel at three. "

After returning to the Exchange Hotel at 3. p.m yesterday, I received the visits of Ladies and gentlemen indiscriminately, and shook hands with them all. Among the persons who have been the most kindly attentive to me here has been Mr Walter Forward, the late Secretary of the Treasury. He has two or three times mentioned to me that there would be some movement of Memorial here against the annexation of Texas to this Union. But I did not trust myself to speak freely with him— Mr Forward is a worthy well-meaning man, of considerable talent, and too pliable disposition— Not the Man of Iron mould that the Times require— Last evening after dark I went with Mr Grinnell and Mr Johnson to visit Miss Rhey one of our traveling companions from Cincinnati, who had sent me a beautiful bouquet of flowers, and had invited us, for last or this evening.— We saw her father mother, brothers and sisters, a respectable family in private life. She was not at home, when we called, but came in as we were taking leave.— We were followed in the dark by a number of persons from the exchange Hotel to Mr Rhey’s door.— We went to the Monongahela house to visit Mrs Campbell, and had not been there ten minutes, before Mr Hay the Mayor of the City, rushed in, and said that the fireman’s Association torch light procession were coming having collected and exhibited themselves in front of the Exchange hotel and finding me not there had followed me down. I went out upon the balcony and the Mayor announced me to the company.— I addressed them in a few words of thanks for the honour done me by them, and of excuse from physical disability, for declining a large discourse—after which they let me off with three bouncing cheers, while I heard a single voice saying—Mr Adams give us a speech— They then strolled off to Mr M’Candless’s house, where they called him out and exacted from him, a speech which he gave them and they dispersed— This morning Mr Denny came in his carriage, and took me to the Presbyterian Church, where Mr Heron preached from Matthew 5.14. “Ye are the light of the world.” We dined in the city of Allegany, with Coll. Robinson late an Agent of the U.S. Government to contract a loan in Europe, which did not succeed— We had a temperance dinner— No wine— And saw his wife—four grown sons and three daughters.— one son married—his wife and child. and Mr M’Candless.— Afternoon at the Exchange Hotel— James G. Moorhead, old antimason, and abolitionist editor of the Indiana, Pennsylvania—gave me a Letter to his son, a Clerk in the 4th. Auditor’s Office— Visit from judge Henry Baldwin. Evening with Mr M’Candless, at the high episcopal church. Revd Mr Uphold a Puseyite, read the Evening service for the 23d. Sunday after Trinity and preached from Hebrews 12.25. "

[symbols]— I have performed my task  I have executed my undertaking, and am returned safe to my family and my home— It is not much in itself— It is nothing in the estimation of the world In my motives and my hopes it is considerable. The people of this Country do not sufficiently estimate the importance of patronizing and promoting Science as a principle of political action and the Slave oligarchy systematically struggle to suppress all public patronage or countenance to the progress of the mind— Astronomy has been specially neglected and scornfully treated— This invitation had a gloss of showy representation about it, that wrought more on the public mind than many volumes of dissertation or argument. I hoped to draw a lively and active attention to it among the people, and to put in motion a propelling power of intellect which will no longer stagnate into rottenness.— I indulge dreams of future improvement to result from this proclamation of popular homage to the advancement of Science, and am willing even to see my name perhaps ostentateously connected with a movement to which I so long and so anxiously strove to give an impulse in vain— For whatever of vain-glory there may be in this self approving reflection I pray to be forgiven— But I return to my home with the symptoms of speedy dissolution upon me— I had no conception of the extent to which I have been weakened by this Tussis Senilis—or Pneumonia Notha, or Old Mans cough— My strength is prostrated beyond any thing that I ever experienced before—even to total impotence— I have little life left in me, but it is my duty to cherish that which God has given me till it shall be his pleasure to take it back.— Mr Frye was here this morning, with papers relating to Mr Thomas Baker Johnson’s estate, and the Execution of his Will— Mr Johnson died on the 14th. of October last— He had constituted me by his last Will his sole Executor.— On receiving information at Quincy of his decease I wrote to Mr Frye enclosing a copy of the Will and requesting him to take all necessary measures with regard to the property here, till I should come— This morning I rode to the City Hall and presented the Will to the judge of the Orphan’s Court, Cassin for the probate. Judge Willam Cranch one of the witnesses to the Will, attested it and judge Cassin approved it— The Register Rotch made out a bond with two sureties, in a penalty of 1600 dollars, for the faithful execution of the Will— The bond to be executed by me, before Letters testamentary would be granted. The judge said he would then appoint two appraisers to be named by me to appraise the personal Estate— Dr Thomas was here, and prescribes for me pills and drops— Walter Hellen dined with us, and Mary Cutts was here this Evening.

A tolerable night— More undisturbed sleep, than I have had for many days before; but I never felt the prostration of strength more than this morning from my rising hour till breakfast.— I took a Seidlitz powder, and lay on the Sopha, all but lifeless— Dr Thomas was here morning and evening—prescribed potions and pills; and confined me to my chamber the whole day; a severer infliction than all his other remedies. Mr Frye and his son Dr Thomas Baker Johnson Frye, were here, and executed as sureties with me the Executor’s bond for the execution of Mr T. B. Johnson’s will given me yesterday by the Register of the Orphan’s Court, Rotch— Mrs Mary C. Adams, and Benjamin F. Andrews are the witnesses.— Mr Mosely the member elect from the New-York Buffalo District, visited me by card.— I wrote my two days of diary arrear. the 17th. and 18th. made the minutes for this day; and gave up the rest of the time to Idleness.— On the 2d. day of last May I left the house where I now write for my home at Quincy, Massachusetts.— I had been since the close of the 27th. Congress on the preceding 3d. of March, afflicted with this grave-yard cough— It had however subsided; but returned upon me for a fortnight, two days after my arrival at my sons house in Boston, on the 6th. of May. On the 16th. of that month I went out with his family to Quincy, where in the course of a week of quiet, the cough disappeared— On the 29th. of May I delivered before the Massachusetts historical Society in Boston, a discourse on the New-England confederacy of 1643. which I had written since leaving Washington. On the 4th. of July, 50 years after me, my son Charles Francis, delivered the Boston city Oration on the anniversary of our National Independence. I dated on this day, my Letter to the Committee at Bangor who had invited me to join them in celebrating the anniversary of the 1st. of August, the day of emancipation of the British West-India Negroes. On the 6th. of July, I left my home at Quincy, and returned to it on the 5th. of August, after an absence of one calendar month on a tour to Lebanon and Saratoga Springs Montreal, Quebec, Niagara Falls, and Western New-York— On the 24th. of October, I met and addressed my Constituents of the 8th Congressional District of Massachusetts, and in the Evening received the visit of Marshal Bertrand.— The Meeting with my Constituents was at Dedham. On the 25th. of October, I left my home at Quincy to lay the corner stone of an Astronomical Observatory at Cincinati, Ohio. "

My cough presses with renewed aggravation, and brought me up between two and three of the morning—and though I returned to bed, I enjoyed no further sleep— I went with my Granddaughter Mary Louisa, and William C. Johnson to the second presbyterian church and heard the Revd. Mr Knox preach from Psalm 51.14 [“]Deliver me from blood-guiltiness O God, thou God of my salvation; and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.” He began by an exposition of the object of this Psalm, penitential and expiatory for the murder of Uriah— He dwelt with laudable vehemence on the atrocious nature of the crime, and supposed the contrition of David for having committed it deep and agonizing and gave the account of the transaction in all its horrid and disgusting details, and with a weight of censure upon David equally severe and uncompromising he turned upon his auditory, and charged us all with having blood guiltiness upon our souls; and then such fervent appeals to our consciences, such solemn expostulations, such terrific comminations, such awful forebodings, for the salvation of our souls, that I could scarcely account for my own insensibility— For our blood guiltiness consisted not in our own infidelity or indifference to the duties of religion, but in our remissness in our exertions to convert the impenitent sinners of our own families and firesides. We are responsible for their unrighteousness, and in suffering them to perish in their sins we are guilty of their blood, to all eternity— There is a fallacy in this reasoning so gross that it is inconceivable to me how it can make an impression upon any mind— This Mr Knox has been very recently setled here as the Pastor of this Presbyterian Church— The negotiation, with the Revd. Ezra Styles Ely, D.D. pending when I left this city last May, terminated unsuccessfully.— I did not attend the afternoon service— There was none at St. John’s Church, which is yet under repair, and Mr Hawley the rector is much indisposed.— Mr Frye was here. His son, the Doctor and Walter Hellen dined with us. Dr Thomas prescribed new potions added to the old— A mixture of boneset herb and snakeroot, infused in a pint of boiling water two hours—a tablespoonful to be taken warm three to four times a day. I received a Letter from my son, enclosing a deed to be executed by me and my wife to-morrow.— Also a Letter from Nathaniel Curtis, enclosing one of 3. Novr. 1843. from Petty Vaughan, London, and 3 sets of Bills of Exchange for £600, £500 and £400. dated 20. Novr 1843 on Petty Vaughan at 30 days sight in favour of——— I signed the bills, and enclosed them back to Mr Curtis— Received Letters also from H. Clay and D. Sears. "

Johnson, of which after his decease at my request he took possession and undertook the management, till I should come and take out the Letters Testamentary, which I did this day, and paid the Register, Rotch a bill for the papers hitherto issued— I named for Appraisers, Matthew St. Clair Clark and Peter Force and they were appointed— A notice of my having obtained Letters Testamentary, of the Orphan’s Court was given me, to be published 3 weeks in the National Intelligencer. I took it to that Office, and left it with Mr Gales. I had executed with my wife the deed yesterday received from my Son of South cove houselot, Boston toSwift, and it was to be acknowledged before David A.

Ladd, Boylston prize declaimer at Cambridge, the day after last Commencement— Visitor at Natick in November 1842—boy at Rossburg in 1828. came and solicited my influence to obtain for him employment as a clerk by some Committee of the house— A desperate adventure. He said he wanted to become a great man. Mr John W. Allen, heretofore a member of the house from Ohio, and whom on the first of this month we met at Cleveland was here with Mr Henry L. Ellsworth the Commissioner of Patents. Mr Allen is here but for a day or two— Mr Hamilton W. Pierson a Tract Society agent and home missionary, informed me, that there would be next Tuesday evening a meeting of the friends of this cause, which he invited me to attend, and to address a few remarks to the company which I declined. Dr Joseph Sewall was here, recently returned from his medical tour to England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Holland, all since last April— Note from Genl.

I bespoke of Mr M’Cormick the Postmaster some Letter paper and other Stationary.— Returning from the Capitol, I stop’d at Miss Polk’s and paid a visit to Mr Mosely the member elect from the Buffalo, District New-York, who gave me some dutch Lozenges, and talked about the election of Speaker of the House. He said he was informed there was yesterday a long interview between William Wilkins, and Robert Barnwell Rhett of South Carolina, at which Mr Wilkins was offered the Speakers Chair, upon condition that he shall organize the Committees to the taste of the Slavemonger’s— This is the desperation of Calhounism— Rhett is the man who oiled the palm of Cushing to make him chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs in my place.

I made this morning the draught of a Resolution, which I propose to offer to the House of Representatives at the approaching Session of Congress— A Session at which a trial of character more severe than I ever before experienced awaits me; and from which may the Mercy of God deliver me to the judgment of the after age, pure and unsullied. Clouds and darkness are before me— Doctor Cassin the judge of the Orphan’s Court called on me and spoke of Mr Thomas B. Johnson’s Will, which he said was a very good one— He said he had not required a bond of me, for double the amount of the fund of 45000 dollars bequeathed to my Son, at Boston, to be disposed of according to the provisions of the Will, because the property being in the State of Massachusetts was out of his jurisdiction, and being bequeathed in special trust to my Son, he did not see that the Executor had anything to do with it— If controversy should arise, it was a case for chancery jurisdiction in Massachusetts, but perhaps it might be proper to deposit a copy of the Will, in the Registry of Probate at Boston— I went to the House where Mr T. B. Johnson last resided and in which he died; and found Mr Clark and Mr Force engaged in appraising the household furniture horses and carriages— Mr Frye was with them. Mr Frye had taken a complete inventory of the Articles, and the Appraisers were using it to make their return.— After staying there some time I came home They finished their appraisement at 2. P.M. and Mr Frye was afterwards here— Likewise his Son the Doctor and Walter Hellen.— I received a Letter from Mr Grinnell, who reached his home at New-Bedford Sunday Morning at half past 7.— He has been a most kind and faithful friend to me on my late expedition— My Resolution is for the appointment of a Committee to ascertain the number of Slave owners throughout the Union, and the value of the property represented bymembers in the house and a proportional number in the electoral Colleges. General Almonte sent me a number of Newspapers— He told me that on the third of this month he had addressed a note to the Secretary of State a protest against the annexation of Texas to the United States, and that the correspondence which ensued, closed about ten days since— The Madisonian is full of premonitory symptoms of the proposition for the annexation of Texas. Mr. W. C. Johnson made a copy of the Will of T. B. Johnson, for Mr John Pope. "

Mrs John Adams, and her daughter Mary Louisa, with William C. Johnson, dined and spent the Evening with Doctor Frye, at his father’s house— Mrs Thornton was here in the Evening, and General Daniel Parker, who told me, that among the Documents to be produced in justification of the message proposing the annexation of Texas to the United States was a correspondence of Andrew Jackson, written in a better than his ordinary Style, referring to communications made to him in 1831 or 1832 by George W. Erving, implicating me for the transfer of the Negotiation of the Florida Treaty from Madrid to Washington, in 1818— This is another Mississippi Navigation conspiracy—and George W. Erving is to be the Jonathan Russell of that Negotiation— Mr Giddings of Ohio came, and introduced Perley B. Johnson, a new member from Ohio, and John Dickey also a member new, from Pennsylvania— We had much conversation upon the projected annexation of Texas— Mr Giddings said he hoped Tyler would recommend it in the Message, for that would be the surest way to render it universally odious. In the Madisonian of last Monday, the Bull of Pope Gregory the 16th. of 3. December 1839. is published in Latin, with an English Translation, and with an introduction signed Roane descanting upon the transcendant importance of the paper, and promising an examination, of every part of it.— This idea is infectious— The quarter from which it comes is passing strange; but an analytical review of the Bull, might be made of vast benefit to the cause of Liberty.

In the intervals between the Sessions of Congress frequent instances occur of applications to me by individuals for my attention to business of theirs here when Congress shall be next in Session.— I promise them my services as the occasions may arise, but when Congress meet, some of these applications have passed away from my Memory and unless reminded again of the business by the applicants themselves, it is neglected. During the present recess of Congress I have adopted the practice of noting in the margin of my Diary these applications as they occur, and on a review of the manuscript, I find them amount to eight; of which I made this day a minute for further remembrance— Among them were the papers delivered to me on the 26th. of last August by Quincy Thaxter of Hingham to authenticate his wife’s claim to a part of the remnants of estate left by William Otis. These papers I now gave to Mr Lewis Johnson the Administrator of William Otis’s estate— They are Affidavits in the Spanish language taken at the Havana testifying that Mrs Thaxter is a daughter of Nathaniel Otis who lived and died at the Havana, and was one of the brothers of William Otis— Mr Johnson said the sum of about 75 dollars might come to Mrs Thaxter from this claim— Mr William Darby brought me a copy of the newly printed 3d. edition of his Universal Geographical Dictionary for which I had subscribed and for which he made me pay him 5 dollars. He said he had read the account of my visit to the female seminary at Washington Pennsylvania.— That it had been very interesting to him, because he was born and raised in that part of Pennsylvania, and was personally acquainted with Miss Foster, the principal teacher who addressed me.— The redemption of my Diary arrears has left me, about two hours of daily leisure till the meeting of Congress for arrears of correspondence— They were employed this day in assorting and filing the Letters received since my return home— Nine tenths of the Letters that I receive are not worth answering.— and the remaining tenth would require more than all my time to be answered as they deserve. Among the papers this day received is a Cincinnati Catholic Telegraph—of 18. November 1843. Rev. Edward Purcell Editor.— It contains a furious attack upon me, for asserting in my astronomical Oration that Ignatius Loyola was the founder of the Inquisition— The Rev. Edward Purcell, I suppose is a Jesuit— Blaise Pascal exposed the Ethics of the Jesuits in 16. The Rev. Edward Purcell shews what they are in 1843. "

My cough is still inflexible, and I was obliged by it to rise this morning at four.— Yet was the day so shivered into splinters that time failed me even to finish an answer to a friendly Letter of Thomas F. Marshall, which I received at Cincinnati— I had a morning visit from Mr John White the Speaker of the House in the last Congress, with Ex-Governor of Ohio Vance, and Mr Harper also heretofore a member from Ohio. They understand that of the members already arrived there is a number sufficient of Kinderhoek democrats to elect a Speaker against any combined opposition— They spoke of the preliminary question of the admission of members elected by general ticket— There is no doubt that they will all be admitted, in defiance of the Law but Mr White expressed a doubt whether the ruling party would allow a discussion of the question and supposed there might be some difficulty in raising it— They intimated a wish that I would undertake to raise it, which I told them I would do if it was desired, but that the state of my health utterly disabled me from taking a leading part in the discussion or management of the movement. I went to the Capitol, chiefly to call upon Mr Clark for the Appraisers return of Mr Thomas B. Johnson’s personal Estate— He told me that he had given it to Mr Force, who had promised to return it the next morning— He said he would see and speak to Mr Force about it, this day. I afterwards called at Mr Force’s office, but he was not there.— At the Capitol I applied at the Clerk’s Office to have the Petitions and papers looked up of which I had minutes from my Diary. I made out to obtain a copy of the House Journal of the last Session of Congress.— I met at the House many members. I was told there had been this morning a Kinderhook Caucus for the choice of Speaker, at which the Calhoun party, said to be 15. did not attend— The whig Caucus was to be held at 4 this afternoon; and Mr Mosely promised to call on me this evening and inform me of its result. Returning home, I met on the way and spoke to T. W. Gilmer.— B. Ogle Tayloe, with George Evans, Senator from Maine— Dellet of Alabama and Beardsley of Utica— Mr Frye came and informed me that the arrangements were all made for removing next Monday Morning at 9 O’Clock the body of Mr Thomas Baker Johnson, from the vault where it was temporarily deposited, to the Rock Creek Church graveyard where it is to be interred, by the side of his mother. This Evening Mr Mosely called as he had promised, and told me that the whig caucus had been held, 32 or 33 members present; and a Committee appointed, to confer with me, and report Monday Morning. "

Mr Hudson and Mr King, members elect of the house of Representatives from Massachusetts called on me last evening and had much conversation with me, on the prospects of the impending Session of Congress, and the inauspicious composition of the house— The question of the admission of the members from four States, elected by general ticket, must arise at the first movement for the organization of the house; but so overwhelming is the majority of the democracy in the house, that the whigs are much perplexed to determine how to raise the question. They expect it will be strangled by a tissue of forms.— The Slavery questions are in my estimation than that of the admission of general ticket members, and the aspect of the Slavery questions is appalling. The most imminent of my dangers is the loss of my temper, from which I fervently pray, I may be preserved.— This morning I went with William C. Johnson to the Unitarian Church and heard Mr Bulfinch preach from Psalm 107.8 “Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!” It was a thanksgiving discourse introduced by a statement of the usage, in New-England, from the earliest settlement of the Country to devote one day annually towards the close of the year to festivity—to the gathering of the members of a family together.— And the day is auspicated by religious worship and thanksgiving to God for all his mercies. Last Thursday was the day of this festival in Massachusetts and others of the New-England States, and would have been the day for the delivery of this discourse if the preacher had been there; and so far as the day is made an occasion of gratitude to God it can never be out of season.— This afternoon I attended at the second presbyterian church— I had supposed that the administration of the communion would have formed a part of the morning service, but it was the whole of that of the evening. Four young men and one young married woman were admitted as members of the church. Mr Knox read to them the confession of faith to which their assent was required, and it included belief of the Trinity and of the eternity of future punishments— This evening Mr Barnard and Mr Winthrop called upon me—members of the whig caucus committee and are to report to-morrow morning.

First Session  At 9 O’Clock this morning I rode out to the methodist episcopal burying ground at the foot of College hill, where the remains of Thomas Baker Johnson had been deposited— There I met Mr Frye, his son, the Doctor, Walter Hellen, and Mr Moody, the husband of Adelaide the present Mrs Hellen’s daughter, with Mr Krepps the undertaker, his assistant, three coaches and a hearse upon which the coffin containing the body of Mr Johnson was already placed. Mr Frye came into my carriage with me, and the cortège proceeded to the grave yard of Rock Creek Church where a grave had been dug and prepared close by the side of that of his mother Mrs Catherine Johnson who died in 1811. The remains of Mr Johnson were now placed in this grave for their last home on earth— The Stone that covers the remains of Mrs Nancy Hellen, Mr Johnson’s eldest Sister is close on the other side of their mother, and that of Walter Hellen her husband is Westward immediately before that of Mrs. Johnson— At 11. I returned home, Mr Frye alighting at my door, and at 12. I rode to the Capitol, and found the house assembled, the Clerk of the late house Matthew St. Clair Clark having just called them to order and beginning the call of the roll, with the State of Maine, and the name of Luther Severance— After Maine came New Hampshire, and the Clerk called the name of Edmund Burke who answered. John Campbell of South Campbell rose and objected to the admission of the members from New-Hampshire, elected by general ticket in defiance of the Constitution and the Law— He offered to read a Resolution, but was not permitted. Mr Barnard of New-York afterwards renewed the attempt to read a protest signed by 80 members of the house against the admission of members elected by general ticket; but his right to read was denied, and the members were all admitted. 189 were announced to be present and they proceeded to elect a Speaker viva voce— John W. Jones of Virginia had 128 votes. John White of Kentucky 59. and William Wilkins of Pennsylvania 1. vote— Jones was declared elected, and was conducted by Walter Coles of Virginia and me to the chair. Dromgoole moved to adopt the rules of the last Congress— I moved to except the rule excluding certain petitions— Other exceptions were moved and debated till near 4. O’Clock when without taking a final vote on the rules, the house adjourned— The usual messages passed between the House and Senate, and the usual joint Committee of notification to the President was raised— Charles J. Ingersoll gave notice that he would to-morrow ask leave to introduce a bill for the relief of Andrew Jackson— "

He wants my influence, which I told him was a negative quantity—much less than nothing— On my way to the Capitol I stop’d at Mr Force’s office, and enquired for the appraisement— He said he had sent it this morning to Mr Clark, who afterwards gave it to me in the house— I found the house again in Session, and French, reading the Journal of yesterday— After it was read Mr Barnard moved an amendment to it, stating the fact of his having offered to read a paper signed by 50 members of the house in the nature of a protest against the admission of the members elected by general ticket— That his right to read the paper had been denied— That a motion had been made that he have leave to read the paper, which had been refused by a large majority— Of all this there was not the slightest notice on the journal— Mr Barnard moved to amend it, and to insert upon the journal the paper itself— Debate thereupon arose, till Charles J. Ingersoll and Wise, the Committee on the part of the house to wait on the President came in and Ingersoll announced that the Message was coming. It came in shortly after—brought byTyler— After the Message was read, Wise moved the printing of the usual number for the use of the members and ten thousand copies with the documents— 15 and 20000 were proposed by members from Alabama, but after much debate the house rejected the larger numbers and adopted Wise’s original number, though he himself had snap’d at the increased number, with pike like voracity. Cave Johnson, added the precaution that the printing should be done by the printers, to be elected by the house— Adjourned without resuming the debate on the amendment of yesterday’s journal. In the evening, Dr Thomas called with Dr Heiskell the Assistant Surgeon general of the army. The Officers of the medical staff have erected a monument to the late Surgeon General Joseph Lovell, and have prepared inscriptions for its faces, which Dr Heiskell left with me requesting me to examine and revise them.

I had sent last Evening, for Mr Dyer the auctioneer, requesting him to call on me this morning, and he accordingly came, and I directed him to make sale of the effects left by Mr Thomas B. Johnson, at the house according to the order in his will. I gave him the appraised inventory, and agreed upon next Monday as the day of sale— Terms, cash for all Articles under a small amount and endorsed notes at 30, 60, or 90 days for larger sums.— After taking book the in a copy of the inventory, he sent me back the appraisement, and I returned it to the Orphan’s court, where I was sworn to it by Mr Roach the Register the judge not being there— Before going to the house, I had two other morning visitors— First a Scottish empirical Doctor Whitlaw, who had been here some twenty years ago with a medicated vapour bath of which he claimed the invention, and which he blazoned forth in the Preston Pans dialect as a panacea for all diseases that afflict the human body.— I then witnessed the administration of his bath, but did not try it.— He soon disappeared, and I had seen or heard nothing more of him till this morning when he came and set his tongue in motion like a mill clapper, till he saw some impatience of uneasiness in my manner, when he left with me a pamphlet, and said he would come again. His pamphlet is an account of a medicated vapour bath institution founded by him in West London, whence he has recently returned to this Country.— The other visitor was Mr Leavitt, editor of the Emancipator, who proposes to pass some time here as Letter writer and Reporter for that paper— I found the house in Session deep sunk in debate on Barnard’s motion to amend the journal by inserting the whig protest against the admission of the general ticket members on that of Monday— The whimsical state of the question now was that the protest was inserted on the Journal of yesterday, and was read as part of that journal this morning—so that the protest is in extenso upon the journal, while the house is debating whether it shall be there or not— After three hours of this hopeful debate Cave Johnson moved to postpone it till tomorrow—which was carried.— The house proceeded to elect a Clerk viva voce Votes 190. Caleb J. M’Nulty of Ohio 124. Matthew St. Clair Clarke 66. Clarke conducted M’Nulty to the Speaker, who swore him in— M’Kay offered a Resolution for the appointment of a Printer—to which Gilmer a silly amendment and the house adjourned.

Jones, as the representative of the sixth Congressional District of Virginia and claiming that seat as lawfully elected to it himself. The memorial is long, and I thought before presenting it, my duty was to possess myself fully of its contents— I accordingly read it attentively— I had also been requested to announce to the house the death of Barker Burnell on the 15th. of June last, the Representative elect to the present Congress of the 10th. Congressional District of Massachusetts— I employed the last Evening and this morning in preparing the address to the house with which this annunciation is to be made. I found the house again in Session, and as I entered, Willoughby Newton a member from Virginia was presenting the memorial of William L Goggin, contesting the election of Thomas W. Gilmer as the Representative of the fifth Congressional District of Virginia. I then presented the Memorial of Mr Botts, and as I was stating its contents Jones slunk out of the chair, and Samuel Beardsley of Utica, New-York crept into it— I moved that the memorial should be printed, and referred to the Committee of Elections, when that committee shall be appointed; which was adopted without opposition— Mr Newton then moved that Goggin’s memorial should also be printed which was carried, and Jones resumed the chair.— Then came a debate what business should be taken up, Mr Barnard contending that his motion to amend the journal of last Monday had precedence and the Speaker deciding that the business last under consideration at the adjournment yesterday must first be taken up now. White the late Speaker appealed but the house 117 to 55 sustained Jones’s decision.— He afterwards decided that the previous question cut off all amendments— White took an appeal again, and again the house sustained Jones.— After much trifling disputation Gilmer’s amendment was rejected, and M’Kay’s Resolution was carried— The choice of printers for the house followed viva voce—names called 197—votes 188.

The elections of yesterday and the day before sufficiently prove that there is no schism in the democratic party, and not the shadow of a party for the election of John Tyler as President of the United States— The house adjourned over to next Monday to give the Speaker time to make up his Committees— He asked to be relieved from the duty of appointing the Committee of Elections, and put Beardsley again in the Chair— Parmenter moved that the Speaker should appoint all the Committees required by therule of the house except the Committee of Elections, which after some talk was carried. Then Hopkins moved that the house should immediately choose a committee of elections. I said I was not ready for that—and if the house was the universal conclusion out of doors would be that the Committee was already packed, and it would have been better to let the Speaker appoint the Committee himself. Saunders in furore said that imputation was a conclusive reason for the house to choose the Committee instanter. But the majority were not ready, and Charles H. Carroll a graft from Maryland upon Western New-York, an ostensible whig moved that Beardsley himself Jones’s substitute Speaker should appoint the Committee— This after some debate was carried 98 to 48. It was growing late— I said I would postpone to another day the communication I had to make to the house, and offered a Resolution for the appointment of Chaplains, which was adopted and the house adjourned over to Monday for the appointment of the Committees.— This morning I went to the house where Mr Thomas B. Johnson died and brought away the Articles of Cloathing, family miniatures, and other personal relics which the Appraisers had not included in their appraisement, but had as is usual left to be disposed of by the family— I found Mr Frye there and he pointed out to me all the articles, of which he had taken the complete inventory.— I went to the probate Court where the judge was sitting. I asked for a copy of the appraised inventory; but the judge said the appraisers must fix an estimated value upon the Articles omitted from the specific appraisement— I took it for that purpose to Mr Force’s Office, but he was not within— The two miniatures of Mr Joshua and Mrs Catherine Johnson, which their Son had given to Mrs Mary Catherine Adams with a small smelling bottle which she had given to him were delivered to her, and, reserving the manuscript books Letters and papers, the other Articles were put in the possession of my wife to be disposed of by the family. Visitors in the course of the day, as by the margin. "

Calvin Mason is a traveling agent for the sale of a new Edition of Tanner’s universal Atlas a copy of which he sent or left here yesterday, and he came this morning to enquire if I would take it for 15 dollars, and I declined. Mrs Hannah Wright was a well dressed lady, who came and in an easy unconcerned manner told me she was in great want of 50 cents to go North, and really did not know to whom to apply for it— She gave a long and by no means clear account of how much money she had had, and how it was all gone—till I asked her if she was married?— yes! where was her husband? here— What was his occupation?— why, if she must tell the whole story, he was in prison—for what?— upon a prosecution about a sum of money, and something alledged about false pretences—but the money was paid— I thought she had earned her 50 cents, and unwilling to press her with further enquiries gave her half a dollar with which she thankfully departed— Mr Frye came and rectified a mistake or two in the inventory that he had made of the personal effects of Mr Thomas B. Johnson; and he went with me, and made the same correction on the appraised inventory returned there— This I took for the additional return of the Appraisers required by the judge of the value of the personal articles of cloathing and the like which they had left out of their appraisement— I called at the Patriotic bank, and received in their bills the last dividend of the Franklin Insurance Company— There I met Mr Force and gave him the appraisement for the additional return— This Mr Clarke and he made out in the course of the day—appraising the Articles before omitted at 150 dollars. They sent the appraisement thus revised back to me, and I sent it by Benjamin to the Register of the Orphan’s Court, Mr Roach. Dr Frye dined with us and Walter Hellen was here in the Evening— I asked him to attend particularly at the sale of next Monday, and to purchase the Piano, and the silver plate for me.— I received visits also from several members of Congress, from Commodore Claiborne of Richmond, Virginia, a self-introduced acquaintance of last year and, with Mr Giddings, from Mr Russell of New-York State, a most worthy and laborious member of the 26th. Congress, but not a member now— He urges a new attempt to rescind the anti-petition rule.   "

My cough has so far subsided that my sleep is less disturbed, and after waking this morning before four, without rising I slept again till past six— A person by the name of Ketcham of the Dutch reformed church, from the State of New-York, volunteered to perform the service of public worship in the hall of the house of Representatives this morning, and I went with William C. Johnson and Mary-Louisa to hear him— He gave out to be sung Watts’s Old hundred, Before Jehovah’s awful throne; but he did not himself set the tune, and there was no singing— He preached from Proverbs 3.17. [“]Her ways, are ways of pleasantness; and all her paths are peace.” The Sermon was a sensible discourse, well delivered, on the pleasantness of the ways of Wisdom, and the Peace of all her paths. Mr Ketcham’s selection of his text, and of his Psalm to be sung was judicious, and impressive; but he could not set the tune for singers to follow him, and his eulogy on Wisdom was hardly commensurate with the pregnant beauty of the text— The character of his mind is decent mediocrity.— The seats of the members were generally filled, but there were less than 20 members of Congress present; among whom were from Massachusetts Mr Bates the Senator, and Grinnell, Hudson, King and Parmenter of the House— Walking home I stop’d at the House of the Mexican Minister, General Almonte, and was introduced to his wife, and his Sister, her mother.— He spoke of the recent re-election of General Santa-Anna as President of the Mexican Republic, and of the relations between Mexico and this Country. A subject upon which I want Prudence and Fortitude to think, and still more to act— After dinner I attended at the second Presbyterian Church, and heard Mr Knox, from 1. Corinthians 15.16. “The sting of death, is Sin.”— Mr Knox’s Sermons are all comminations— It is well for Christians to be often warned of their responsibilities, their imperfections and their Sins.— But Sin is a term of so indefinite a meaning, that to declaim against it is to brandish a sword in the air— I spent this evening in preparing for the duties of the coming week, and in meditating purposes never to be performed— On full deliberation I conclude that the whole course of my conduct in this Congress must be defensive, even of the cause of Liberty, and above all things to endure mortification.

My Journal of yesterday was made up before breakfast; but household concerns, marketing, grocery bills, and multitudes of Newspapers by the Mail, distracted my attention, so that I barely began reading in the National Intelligencer the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the finances; when it was snatched by 3 or 4 successive calls, from my hands and I saw the paper no more— Antoine came with a promissory note, dated 11. Novr. 1842. and signed by Thomas B. Johnson to pay in 12 months from that day 150 dollars.— I paid the money and took up the note— Antoine gave me a somewhat discouraging account of the Affairs of the Franklin Insurance Company, and spoke of a report by a Committee of Stockholders made last September, which he afterwards brought and left here, shewing that for the last seven years, the profits of Insurance of the company have not amounted to more than an average of 100 dollars a year— There is very bad, if not fraudulent management of the concern.— Mr Johnson’s household furniture, Carriages and horses were this day sold at auction, at the house by Robert W. Dyer. I was unable to attend the sale in person, but Mr Frye and Walter Hellen did— He was here Morning and Evening. For the first time I reached my seat just before the house was called to order by the Speaker. The journal stated that the memorial of John M. Botts, contesting the election of John W. Jones, presented by me was laid on the table— I moved to amend the journal by stating the fact, that my motion agreed to by the house was that the memorial should be printed and referred to the Committee of Elections when appointed.— Jones put Hopkins in the chair and my motion to amend the journal was adopted— The Committee of Elections, (Beardsley’s[)]—was the only one announced. Payne, Elmer, Schenk Chapman of Va, Newton, Hamlin, Ellis, Douglass, and Vinton, who asked to be excused for physical inability, and Garrett Davis was appointed in his place— The amendments of the Journals of Monday and Tuesday last, by Mr Barnard to insert the minority protest in the Journal of Monday and of Chappell of Georgia, to strike it out of the Journal of Tuesday, were now debated, upwards of three hours— The motion to insert was losttoThe motion to strike out was carried.— The debate on the Rules was taken up and Dromgoole offered a Resolution for a new Rule that no paper shall be entered on the Journals, excluded by a majority of the house— Debate and the house adjourned— Evening occupied in assorting Letters.

In assorting my Letters last Evening which I did not complete, I found ten cases of individual private interests, claiming or soliciting my aid or service here— I made minutes of them for memory, and this morning gave personal attention to a part of them— At the Department of State I delivered to the present Secretary Upshur a Letter to him from John M. Leitch a merchant in New-York, who had enclosed it to me, requesting me to deliver it to the Secretary of State— It contained an enquiry whether the United States would protect a commercial adventure to the coast of Circossia? Upshur read the Letter, and said in a sulky tone that a duplicate of the same Letter had been received by him and answered that to such general enquiries no other than a general answer could be given— What the general answer was, he did not say— I went to the Pension Office, and left with the Commissioner Edwards the Letter of L. W. Clark of Bradford, Massachusetts concerning a Pension claim of his mother and the Letter of Joseph M. Forward of 4. Decr 1843. another pension claim.— My next call was at the War Office, where I saw the Secretary Porter and the chief Clerk Genl Parker. Mr Porter was gracious and complacent in his manner— I requested him to have the name of Augustine Reed of Roxbury entered as an applicant for a cadet warrant at the West-Point Academy; and left with him five recommendatory Letters in his favour. I then went to the house, and as I entered heard French now the chief clerk, reading the journal of yesterday and pronouncing my name as first of the committee of manufactures— Charles J. Ingersoll Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, James I. M’Kay of the Ways and Means and William Wilkins of the judiciary.— After the reading of the journal Payne of Alabama, whom Beardsley had appointed chairman of the Committee of Elections, asked to be excused on account of physical disability— Barnard moved to amend the journal of yesterday by inserting the protest, and claimed precedence for his motion— The Speaker decided that Payne’s motion to be excused from serving on a Committee was a privileged question, and had precedence by his rising first— Payne was excused, and Barnard’s motion brought up Hector Dromgoole, and a growling debate till between one and two, when Dickins Secretary of the Senate came in with a message announcing the death of Doctor Linn a Senator from Missouri, whereupon a Missouri member pronounced his Eulogy and offered the usual Resolutions including adjournment.— I called on the Postmaster General Wickliffe, and on General Almonte.

My call yesterday on the Postmaster General was to lay before him a Letter from Joseph Lewis Late Postmaster at Plymouth complaining of his removal, and asking copies of the memorials and petitions against him, and of a correspondence between Schuyler Sampson and David Henshaw. Mr Wickliffe made no remarks upon the Letter but asked me to leave it with him which I did. My call on General Almonte was to ask his good offices to obtain the release of Israel Canfield one of the Texian prisoners in Mexico, in whose behalf I had received a Letter from Doctor Lewis Condict of New Jersey. The General took down the name, and promised his good Offices. He said he had obtained the release of a son of Mr Crittenden the Senator from Kentucky— This morning Mrs Telfair came with another budget of ragged papers, and a racket of eloquence about her claim but without a clear idea of it herself, and without the possibility of giving a clear idea of it to me. I asked her to prepare her petition and bring it to me and promised to present it— She said she would. That must at least contain some intelligible statement.— At the house after the reading the journal, I asked to be excused from serving on the Committee of Manufactures; the state of my health making it impossible for me to discharge the arduous duties of that office as they ought to be performed— I said I had other reasons, with which it was not necessary for me to trouble the house— The vote to excuse me passed without opposition.— Reuben Chapman of Alabama, and Edward J. Black of Georgia appeared and took their Seats, and Black made a fiery speech. L. Q. C. Elmer who by the house’s excusing Payne from serving on the Committee of Elections has become chairman of that Committee, moved, that the papers relating to the contested elections should be referred to it which was done. Garret Davis moved that the Committee of Elections do enquire and report to the house whether the members from the four general ticket States have been elected according to Law and are entitled to retain their Seats— Steenrod moved to strike out the Committee of elections and insert a select Committee; and up sprung a debate which promised a day of bawling and chicanery, till between one and two, when a message came in from the Senate announced the death of Samuel M’Roberts a Senator from the State of Illinois; whereupon Wentworth a member from that State pronounced his Eulogy, and the house adjourned— Evening laborious but much indisposed "

They disable me more for labour, and depress more deeply my Spirits. Dr Heiskell was here this morning, and took back the three draughts of an inscription for the tomb of Dr Joseph Lovell— I had revised them so as to adopt a part of each of the three— The Doctor was well satisfied with my proposed amendments, and thanked me for my compliance with his request— I left at Mr Lewis Johnson’s office a Letter from John Otis, and at the Navy Department a Letter for Lieutenant Joseph H Adams, who sailed last September to join the squadron in the Pacific— My namesake passed midshipman John Quincy Adams, sailed in the same month of September in the Schooner Decatur for the Coast of Africa— No intelligence has been received at the Department, from either of those vessels, since they sailed— The Secretary of the Navy David Henshaw, was as smiling and as courteous as his colleague Porter of the War Department had been— He had said that if there was any thing at any time in the Department which I wished to be done; if I would drop him a line it should be immediately attended to— Such is the way of the world— There is not a man living who has used fouler means to blacken my reputation and destroy my character than David Henshaw. Of the two, I prefer the growling sulkiess of Upshur— I called at the Patriotic Book; deposited there a check for 240 dollars, received as the Executor of Thomas B. Johnson’s Will, from Mr Frye, who at the decease of Mr Johnson had received that sum from Mrs W. S. Smith.— I took a bank book and opened an account as Executor with the Bank.

They were adopted without opposition— Mr Wilkins chairman of the judiciary committee came to me and said he wished to have a long conversation with me upon subjects of importance referred to that Committee. Mr Colamer, now chairman of the Committee of manufactures, made the same proposition to me which in both cases I accepted. "

A dose of rhubarb and magnesia was the remedy of this morning for the present stage of my complaint— At the house immediately after the reading of the Journal, Dromgoole called up the question about the rules— There was Garret Davis’s motion for the reference of the general ticket elections to the Committee, and Mr Barnard’s last motion to amend the journal so as to insert the protest, both of which had precedence over the rules; but with the consent of the movers both these were postponed— Dromgoole’s motion for a new rule to exclude from the Journals all papers, not received by the house, first came up, and Collamer of Vermont made a short sensible speech against it— Cave Johnson moved the previous question which the Speaker speaker decided cut off all amendments— Dromgoole wanted to have his new rule first adopted and intreated Cave to suspend his motion for that purpose; but Cave was inflexible— The previous question was carried, and the rules with the exception of the two struck out on Wise’s motion with my amendment for going into and coming out of Committee of the whole by mere majority votes were adopted including the hour rule and the gag— Dromgoole then moved his rule for excluding from the journal any paper which the house refuses to receive, and it was carried without even taking the yeas and nays— Sundry other Resolutions were offered, but William H. Stiles of Georgia arrested them by announcing the death of Coll. John Millen a member elect of the house from that State, upon whom he pronounced an eloquent eulogy and then moved the usual honorary resolutions, adopted without opposition, and the house adjourned— In the evening besides Walter Hellen I received three successive visitors— My next door neighbour and tenant, first comptroller of the Treasury.— I found him on conversation a very earnest adversary to all internal improvements, though he said he was afraid the growing strength of the West would force them down— Mr John J. Crittenden, one of the Senators from the State of Kentucky, who left with me for my perusal a private and confidential Letter from H. Clay to him on the subject of Texas—dated the 5th of this month He thinks Texas in Tyler’s hands is a mere firebrand, to be noticed as little as possible.

Saturday  I expended all the leisure of this morning in copying a list of the yeas and nays on my motion to except the 23d. or anti-petition rule, from the adoption by the house of the rules of the last Congress— Two hundred members of the present house have taken their seats— The vote of the whigs has never exceeded 65. that of the democracy has not passed 130.— The democratic majority may be set down, as averaging just two thirds— Yet on my motion the vote stood 91 to 94 a majority of only 3 to retain the rule— 27 members from New-York voted for my motion—only 5 against it— 12 from Pennsylvania for and 8 against it. Ohio 13 for and 5 against it— This morning, immediately after the reading of the journal the Speaker said the first business in order was the call of the States for Petitions— This caused surprize the practice of presenting petitions openly in the house having been superseded in the last Congress, by that of presenting them silently at the clerks table, and having them referred to the appropriate Committees— The Speaker was now reminded of this practice, which he explicitly recognised, but called out Petitions are in order from the State of Maine.— Mr Barnard first urged to proceed immediately to the election of a chaplain, and cavilling objections being made, moved a suspension of the rules, which was carried by a vote of two thirds.had moved a resolution that the house would dispense with the election of a chaplain for the present Session; but this proposition was immediately scouted down.— At the first viva voce vote for chaplain, there was no choice; at the secondTinsley was chosen— M’Kay, chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means moved the reference of the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the finances, in parcels to four separate Committees. I objected to this and insisted that the whole Report should be referred to the Committee of Ways and Means, which after a short and spirited debate was done— Then the Speaker called again for petitions, for which no one seemed prepared— The States of Maine and New Hampshire were quickly despatched— Massachusetts was called— Parmenter and D. P. King offered Resolutions of the Legislature which were ordered to be referred and printed— The Speaker hurried on and called Rhode Island and Connecticut till Winthrop called him back— I then rose and presented a memorial fromAppleton and Co. and 96 Booksellers and traders praying for an international copy right Law, which was after some discussion orderedered to be printed and referred to a select Committee. My next presentment was a petition from James B. Cooper and 585 citizens of New praying Congress to separate the People of New-York, from all connection whatever with Slavery—and this produced a blow up and adjournment— "

The explosion which took place in the house, on my presenting yesterday the anti-slavery petition of 585 citizens of Western New-York is a premonitory symptom of the desperation with which the Slave power will be exercised in the present Congress— The Latimer petition signed by upwards of 50000 names was received at the last Session of Congress, and referred to the judiciary Committee— The Petition from New-York which I presented yesterday contains the same prayer in the same identical words— The Speaker instantly decided—that it was excluded from reception by the gag-rule now the 23d. I remonstrated, that on the Journals of the last Session, it was recorded that petitions in the same words were received and referred to the judiciary Committee. Half a dozen Slave breeders were already on their feet— The Speaker coolly said—[“]does the gentleman appeal from the decision of the chair?” I said I had already too much experience not to be aware of the fate of any appeal from the decision of the chair—but that I intreated the Speaker to revise his own decision so far as to look at the precedent on the Journal of the last Session. The Speaker said he considered the petition excluded by the rule.— I then said that if the Speaker refused to look at the precedent, I had no other alternative, and must take an appeal from his decision— At this instant, T. W. Gilmer started up in a panic and moved to adjourn, which after a short respite to receive communications from the Executive departments was carried without opposition; the Speaker saying in the most courteous tone that he would very cheerfully examine the precedents. This morning I went with my granddaughter Mary Louisa to the Hall of the House of Representatives, and heard Mrs Rachel Barker, of the Society of Friends discourse close upon two hours on Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, without naming a text but commenting on the whole 4th chapter of Daniel.— She has the gift of fluency, without an instant of hesitation—very distinct articulation, without cant or sing song—but very little power of reasoning and not much imagination— That she could retain so long an attentive auditory without being absolutely tedious argues no ordinary talent; but she flies from subject to subject, and has a cento of scriptural quotations by heart which supplies her copiously with words— Walter Hellen was here— After dinner at the Presbyterian Church I heard Mr Knox from Mark 16.16. last part of the verse “but he that believeth not shall be damned—” William C Johnson left us, and went this evening to Gadsbys to start in the cars to morrow. I was quite unwell this evening and Dr. Thomas was here "

Monday  William Clarkson Johnson of Utica, New-York, a son of my long deceased brother Charles’s second daughter, also deceased, is in the third and last year of law studies to fit him for practice at the bar He is to be admitted next July, and among other indefinite purposes had thought of settling at Boston. He had at my invitation accompanied me on my recent Western tour, and I had invited him to spend the winter with us here— But on making enquiries of my Son, he is discouraged from the project of making a settlement at Boston— He now wavers between New-York and Philadelphia. On receiving a Letter from my Son yesterday, he concluded to depart immediately; went last night to Gadsby’s and took this morning the cars for Philadelphia Rachel Barker came this morning with her husband Caleb, and four others, introduced by Richard D. Davis a democratic member from Western New-York, and paid me a visit— She gave me a full dose of the effusion of the Spirit, and is perfectly happy in the conviction of her own spiritual perfection.— But for the rigidity of muscle which belongs to the quaker variety of the human species, Rachel would be handsome— Her eye is full of intelligence and conscious power. I asked her at what age she first felt the spur of her vocation to preach the gospel?— She said before she was ten years old, but that she began to preach between 16 and 17. and when she first began was as fully qualified for the work then as she is now, or ever shall be. At the house the new chaplain Tinsley made the prayer, short of 3 minutes— After the reading of the Journal the Speaker said the first business in order was Garret Davis’s resolution to refer the general ticket election question to the Committee of Elections— I enquired how it happened that the call for petitions was superseded? He said that G. Davis’s resolution was a privileged question and thereby took precedence.— Jameson made a long bandit speech, about his right to his seat’s being as good as that of any other member and Kennedy moved a resolution declaring them all duly elected.— Elmer moved a modification of G. Davis’s motion which Davis accepted, and the house adjourned without taking the question— At 8 this evening I met Wise’s Committee on the revisal of the rules in the chamber of the Committee of Commerce— Only seven members of the Committee were present—we sat till near ten, and adjourned to meet Wednesday Morning at ten.

The Committee for the revisal of the Rules was raised on the motion of Wise by a stale device to worm through the gag rule at the commencement of a Congress, when the new members are most prone to renounce the rule, by giving them a pretext for retaining it for a time— This scheme was tried at the first Session of the last Congress, with entire success— The Committee was announced yesterday morning— Henry A. Wise, John Q. Adams, George C. Dromgoole, Samuel Beardsley, John White, Charles J. Ingersoll, John W. Davis, Samuel F. Vinton and Reuben Chapman are the Committee, and in the course of the day Wise sent round to the members of the committee s. . . notification to meet in the chamber of committee of Commerce last and every evening. Seven of us met accordingly. I found them assembled Ingersoll and Dromgoole absent— We had some general conversation about the rules and then agreed to take them up and discuss them seriatim—we went through 8 of them proposing petty amendments as we proceeded and then adjourned. Wise had a copy of the rules, with manuscript proposals of amendment by French now chief Under Clerk of Clerks’ Office; but we found very little substance in them— This Morning Mr Crepps was here, and I paid him three bills of charges for the expenses of Mr Thomas B. Johnson’s funeral amounting to 181. dollars and 6. cents. Enormous extortion, for which there was no remedy.— At the House Wise moved a suspension of the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, to dole out in driblets the President’s Message to the standing Committees—and it was carried— Jones gave the chair of the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to Hopkins of Virginia, and Wise parceled out the Message to 13 or 14 Committees. He came at last to some dark no meaning words about Western rivers and waters, and moved their reference to the Committee of Ways and Means— And now the West blazed out in a cross fire of debate for three hours when Weller of Ohio moved the committee to rise, and the house adjourned— Evening Meeting at Coll. Abert’s; intended to be of the board of Management of the National Institute The Secretaries of State, War and Navy Departments, but not one of them came— But there was a jovial supper at which we sat till half an hour past midnight.

Wednesday  At ten this morning I was at the chamber of committee of Commerce at the house, to which time and place the Committee for the revisal of the revisal of the rules was adjourned. successively the other members of the committee came in, except Wise the Chairman, and Dromgoole who since Saturday night has been invisible.— By a quarter past ten there was a quorum of the Committee; but they waited three quarters of an hour for the appearance of the chairman.— I then observed that being the second person named on the Committee, by the rules of the house, the absence of the chairman, the duties of that office devolved upon me.— I proposed therefore to resume the revisal of the rules, in their order— The revisal had been made at the former meeting to the 8th inclusive—the 9th. and 10th. were now passed without alteration, when after eleven Wise made his appearance— Beardsley reminded him of the hour—he said he had mistaken it— That Mr Espy had been holding him by the button, till he grazed upon the time of meeting of the Committee, and he must take care that it should not happen again.— We then resumed the discussion of the rules and after some phizzing of steam at the 16th. rule which gives the power to the Speaker or chairman of the Committee of the whole to clear the galleries an cases of disorder, we travelled through to the 18th. and 19th rules, concerning the admission of Stenographers into the house— There was in the Committee a general outbreak against this corps of reporters, and sundry restrictive amendments to the rules relating to them were proposed. I told the Committee that it was a hornet’s nest, which it might be prudent not to disturb—whereupon the Committee adjourned till to-morrow at ten. In the house, the Public Lands, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, David Levy’s right to his seat as delegate from the territory of Florida, and a National Foundery, were of the usual usurpers on the business of the day— The question of reception upon Barnard’s motion to amend the journal, was at last on the motion of Steenrod laid on the table by yeas and nays 116 to 59. Garrett Davis’s motion directing the Committee of Elections to report on the validity of the certificates of the members elected by general ticket was at last adopted by yeas and nays 148 to 32— Petitions— The Speaker reversed his decision of Saturday, and declared the Petition of James B. Cooper and 585 citizens of New-York State, not excluded by the rule—but the question of reception was made and laid on the table 97 to 80. and the new vital struggle for the right of petition commenced in the midst of which the house adjourned— In the evening I went with Mary and her daughter, and Walter Hellen, and heard the Italian Opera of Bellini— I Puritani— Memento!

Winter Solstice  The National Intelligencer of this morning announces the death of Smith Thompson a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States— He died last Monday at his residence at Poughkeepsie in the State of New-York— Mr Charles H. Carroll, the representative from the District, read to me yesterday a Letter from judge Thompson’s grandson Smith, written immediately after he expired, to inform Carroll of the fact— Judge Thompson was one of my colleagues as Secretary of the Navy in the Cabinet of James Monroe.— Of that cabinet there remain now living only John C. Calhoun and myself.— Monroe himself—Crawford, Wirt Southard Thompson, have gone to their account— May I be also ready! This morning, I attended again the Committee for the revisal of the rules first in the room of the Committee of Commerce. But as that Committee met at 11. we passed into the adjoining room of the Committee on Post Offices and Post roads.— The Chairman Wise was again tardy a full hour—and Davis of Indiana, engaged upon another Committee, came in still later. Dromgoole did not show his Cognac face—though he did afterwards in the house, but without taking any part in the debate— The Committee resumed the revisal of the rules and after discussing, adopting or rejecting various proposed amendments, came to the 24th and 25th. concerning the presentation, and reception of Petitions. Here was the stumbling block. I moved to strike out the last clause of the 24th. and the whole of the 25th. rule. It was noon, and the Committee adjourned till 10. to morrow Morning.— In the house, the life and death struggle for the right of Petition was resumed— The question of reception of the petition from Illinois was laid on the table 98 to 80. After a long and memorable debate— I then presented the Resolves of the Massachusetts Legislature ofMarch 1843 proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, making the Representation of the People in the house proportioned to the numbers of free persons—and moved it should be read, printed and referred to a select Committee of 9. and now sprung up the most memorable debate ever entertained in the house; in the midst of which the house at half past 3 adjourned.— I can give no account of it— Wise formally surrendered at discretion his citadel rule, to the right of petition— Then came a cross fire between Holmes, Beardsley, Weller, and French—till at the motion of Belser of Alabama, the house adjourned— R. D. Davis of New-York had taken the floor— The crisis now requires of me coolness, firmness, Prudence, Moderation, and Fortitude beyond all former example— I came home in such a state of agitation that I could do nothing but pace my chamber.

Wise the Chairman came in reasonable time; but Vinton was very late. I had moved to strike out the 25th. rule; and that part of the 24th. which at my motion was adopted on the 29th. of March 1842. as a necessary substitute, to obtain the reception of petitions at all— I insisted upon the question’s being put on striking them both out together, which after some discussion was agreed to—the question was taken by yeas and nays— Ayes Beardsley, John W. Davis, John White and Adams— Nays Wise, Chapman, and C. J. Ingersoll, who as soon as the vote was decided declared he was glad it had passed— It suited him exactly— Such is the double nature of the man. Wise had prepared a substitute ten times worse than the rule to be rescinded— The same that was palmed upon the Committee to revise the rules at the first Session of the last Congress.— That on the presentation of any petition, memorial or paper relating in any manner to Slavery, the question of consideration shall always be considered as raised, and they shall be laid on the table.— Wise now declined to offer it. But Chapman did—and the vote upon it was Ayes Chapman, Ingersoll, Wise, nays Adams, Beardsley, Davis, Vinton and White— Dromgoole would have voted against rescinding the existing rule, and for the substitute; but he was not present, and has not attended any Meeting of the Committee. After this decision, the Committee discussed two or three more rules, and adjourned to Tuesday Morning at ten. Wise as Chairman put into my hands French’s paper book, and the minutes of the proceedings of the Committee hitherto—said he was going to Virginia and should be absent 8 or 10 days In the House— The Journal made up under the direction of the Speaker stated that I was called to order for offensive words— I moved to amend the journal by stating that I was called to order by Saunders of North-Carolina for irrelevancy, sustained by the Speaker—this pretence of irrelevancy being a mere subterfuge to suppress the freedom of Speech— It was under this offensive act of the Speaker, that I used the words at which he chose to take offense, and to order me to take my seat— Barnard and Winthrop urged me to move to strike out the statement that I was called to order for offensive words; but with this house, I knew I should fail on that motion, and as I did use offensive words, although they were not taken down, or even assigned by the Speaker as his reason for ordering me to take my seat, and the Speaker had no right to enter upon the journal, that he had called me to order for offensive words, I was willing to leave that entry as it was, adding the previous entry that the Speaker had already sustained a slave-tainted call of me to order, for irrelevancy— He agreed that my amendment should be entered in the Journal. The occurrences in the house yesterday and this day have been so extraordinary that they would require a narrative which it is impossible for me to write out, but a brief summary of which I must borrow a supernumerary page to record.— Yesterday after the long snarling debate to suppress the enthusiastical petition from the State of Illinois, finally read, and upon question of its reception laid on the table, when I presented the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts, and moved the reference of them to a select Committee of 9. Jameson moved the Committee on the judiciary,a Committee of one member from each State, Wise rose, called upon the Reporters to take note of what he was about to say, asked the particular attention of the house, and declared once for all, and forever that he renounced this War against Southern rights which had been several years waged in the hall— He would vote for my motion to refer these Resolves to a select Committee, and hoped I should be the chairman of it that the whole Committee should be of the same complexion; and that the whole mass of abolition petitions should be referred to the same Committee, that we might make a report in our own way, and the house and the country might see what we were after— Whereupon Holmes, Beardsley, Weller and French, made frothy and foaming speeches about abolition, R. D. Davis rose to take the floor, and I said I hoped I should be indulged with an opportunity to say a few words, when the house adjourned— This day, when the Speaker announced the call for petitions, as the order of the day—R. D. Davis rose again to take the floor, but Preston King one of the five members from New-York, who clings to the gag-rule made a feeble attempt to deprive me of the floor to reply to the slave mongers licensed all day yesterday— He charged me with arresting the progress of the presentation of petitions— I said I would not move a suspension of the rules to obtain permission to address the house, but only demanded a decision upon my motion to refer the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts to a select Committee— Hudson moved to suspend the rules to enable me to address the house and Hunt of New-York called the yeas and nays on the motion— The vote was 123 to 46. and I spoke about an hour in reply to Wise, Holmes, Weller and French— Desultory, weak, and superficial—but effective— Belser moved to lay the Resolves of Massachusetts on the table— Lost 64 to 104. Jameson withdrew his motion to refer them to the Committee on the judiciary Committee, and my motion to refer them to a select Committee of 9 was carried without a division. "

                "text": "23. V:30 Saturday.  I had received an invitation, with a card from Mr A. P. Upshur, to attend a meeting of the board of management of the National Institute, to be held at the Office of the Secretary of State at 10. O’Clock this morning— I attended accordingly— The meeting numbered about 40 persons It was to transact the business for which the evening supper party had been gathered at Coll. Abert’s, last Tuesday; but which then failed by the non-attendance of the heads of departments, who constitute the board of Management— The Secretaries of State, War and Navy were now present— Mr Upshur proposed me, as chairman of the meeting, and Joseph R. Ingersoll as Secretary, which was unanimously agreed to.— Then sundry Resolutions were proposed and adopted among which was one that a Committee of 5 should be appointed by the Chairman, to draw up a memorial to asking for the national Institute patronage and pecuniary assistance. All this had been prepared beforehand by Mr Markoe, and I appointed this Committee immediately, with Richard S. Coxe for their chairman. There was a Resolution also that Mr Woodbury should present the Memorial to the Senate and I to the House— And Another that Mr Walker should deliver an Address at the next annual meeting of the Institute, and I an Oration in Feby.  I said I would very cheerfully perform the service assigned to me should it be in my power; but it was extremely doubtful whether it would ever be in my power— It certainly would not during the present Session of Congress— They altered the words, to read on some future day of which due notice will be given— Charles J. Ingersoll made a speech, sensible enough but dealing in generalities— Mr Woodbury said he was a strict constructionist, but he had voted for the act of Incorporation of the Institute (27. July 1842) because it was in the District of Columbia; and because it was necessary for the preservation and safe keeping of the curiosities collected in the several Departments of the Government— The meeting adjourned about noon I came home, and soon after, Mr Charles Boutelle brought me a Letter of introduction from judge John Davis of Boston— Mr Boutelle is a young civil engineer who has been employed in the survey of the North-eastern boundary, and wishes now employment on the Coast Survey— I went with him and introduced him to the Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer, who gave him no encouragement to expect employment for the present or approaching Season. I came home again, had visits from Mr G. P. Marsh Member of the House from Vermont and from Mr Leavitt— I went to the Capitol, Clerk’s Office, and to Mrs Whitwells, where I saw Mrs Grinnell, I. C. Bates, and R. C. Winthrop— Evening at the Theatre Bellini’s Norma "

                "text": "24. V.30. Sunday.  I told Mr Beardsley yesterday morning that I had thoughts of proposing to the Committee on the revisal of the rules to report in part immediately, to strike out from the rules, the gag and its counterpart for the reception of petitions—that is the 25th. and the latter part of the 24th. rule. He asked if I thought that would be the best way to get rid of the rule I said I did. He said he was decided for getting rid of the rule— I asked Mr Markoe, if it was true as currently reported that Mr Wise was nominated for the mission to France. He said he would enquire of the Secretary of State, which he did, and said Mr Upshur had answered “not to his knowledge[”]— At the Clerk’s Office yesterday, I obtained a copy of J. P. Kennedy’s Colonization report, made at the last Session of Congress. I ordered the Globe Madisonian and semi-weekly Richmond whig for the Session. And I directed the reference to the judiciary Committee of all the petitions, referred to that Committee on the 23d. of last February. I did not see Mr Grinnell when I called yesterday at Mrs Whitwell’s. He had just taken a vapour bath, and was in bed— His disease is the gravel, and may confine him for weeks. He and Mrs Grinnell were engaged to dine with us on Christmas day; but she now disengaged him and herself— The Music of the Opera of Norma, which with Mrs John Adams and her daughter Mary-Louisa, I saw last evening is delicious— The character of Norma is more deeply interesting than that of Elvira, in the Puritani, in which play there is nothing very impressive but the Liberty song— This morning at the Foundery, Methodist Episcopal Church I heard the Revd. Mr Colquitt of Georgia, otherwise called judge Colquitt or lawyer Colquitt, or the honourable Walter T. Colquitt, Senator of the United States from Georgia— His text was 2. Corinthians 6.1. “We then as workers, together with him, beseech you also, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain—” He had read the 5th. chapter and stretched over it the commentary upon his text. He is the most thorough Jack at all trades, in the public service, and much better suited for an Ambassador for Christ as a Methodist preacher, than for a member of either House of Congress. His action in the pulpit is too excessive for his sincerity; there is a convulsive motion in the muscles of his face, and his voice often sinks from a strong base organ into ventriloquism— I have received a Letter from a woman a stranger to me but who says she knows him well, and warns me to beware of him.— The house was crowded, and his sermon was eloquent After dinner I attended at the Presbyterian Church, where a Doctor Armstrong from New York preached a missionary Sermon from Romans 1.16. “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth; to the Jew first and also to the Greek” On returning home I found here Mr Roberts of Baltimore "

Ingersoll, with whom I do yet make out to keep on speaking terms, but whose political morality is so dissolute, and his nature so treacherous, that my regard for him as a once valued friend has more than once exploded— His double dealing now is from a maggot in his brain, worming him into the belief that as a representative of the Keystone State, with his transcendent talents he is the man to hold the balance between the Northern and Southern Sections of the Union, and that in the exercise of that umpirage he is to cast his dead-weight always on the side of the South as the weaker party— He has now prevailed upon nineteen of his colleagues of the Pennsylvania to join him in a written recommendation to President Tyler of Horace Binney for the Office of judge of the United States, in the place of Smith Thompson. He knows well that Tyler will not nominate Binney—but his motive is two fold—first to ingratiate himself with Binney, to whom he will take care to make known his recommendation of him— And secondly to prevent Tyler from nominating John Sergeant, as he fears he might under the influence of Wise whose wife is Sergeant’s daughter, do.— This is the nature of the man; and these are his ways— At home Dr T. B. J. Frye, and Richard M. Cutts paid us Christmas visits and Mr Leavitt called— The report in the National Intelligencer of my last Friday’s speech is a very indifferent one and contains several gross blunders— Mr Leavitt’s notes corrected them in part, but not entirely, and add nothing to the report except a note alluding to the call of me to order by the Speaker, and his order to me to take my seat— There was circulated yesterday a printed handbill about Calhoun, Van Buren and Texas.— Mr Leavitt had not seen it and I lent it to him— Also the Cincinnati Morning Herald containing the reply of the Committee of the Irish Repeal Association at Cincinnati to the answer from the repeal Association in Ireland to a Letter from the Cincinnati repealers written last Summer, and containing an open brazen faced defence of the institution of Slavery in this Country.— The present Letter disavows in the most indignant tone and manner the servile sycophancy of the last Summer’s Letter, and exposes the abominations of the Slavish power in this Country— We had company to dine— Messrs. Bates, Barnard, Hudson, King, Moseley, Winthrop, Roberts and Walter Hellen— Mr and Mrs Grinnell were detained by his indisposition— Most of our company went this Evening, to the concert of the great fidler Ole Bull— "

W. Davis, C. J. Ingersoll, Vinton and White— Absent Wise and Dromgoole, whose second week of drunken vacation has commenced. They call it a breeze.— I proposed to the Committee, to report forthwith in part—that is to rescind the 25th. and the last clause of the 24th. rule.— but all the other members of the Committee were averse to the proposal, and I did not press it— The Committee proceeded to review the rules in their order—made sundry alterations none of which appeared to me to be amendments, and wasted time in debating and rejecting other critical substitutions of synonimous words— Adjourned till to-morrow morning at ten— In the house there were attempts by several members to divert the order of bu- which not being duly repressed by the Speaker, consumed a considerable portion of the day— I enquired of the business left unfinished in Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union last week, that is the parceling out of the President’s Message to the Committees was not the first in order— The speaker said it was not— At last the Speaker called for Petitions— I presented one from Connecticut, containing 4 prayers the first of which was for the abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade in the District of Columbia—the other 3 prayers were not within the rule, and I moved the reference of the forth—intercouse with Hayti, to the Committee of Foreign Affairs.— The Speaker decided that the whole Petition was excluded— This was contrary to the Precedents— I appealed from the decision, but it was sustained by the house 105 to 40— "

V.30 Wednesday  Soon after 9 O’Clock this morning, I called at the Department of State, and found the Secretary Upshur there— He furnished me immediately with the official certificate that E. N. Roach, is the Register of Wills in this County, annexed to the official copy of Mr Thomas B. Johnson’s Will, which I despatched from the Post-Office of the house— At 10. I met the Committee on the revisal of the rules in the room of the Committee of Commerce— We made some progress in the operation; but every member has whims of his own to alter and amend and in the way of mutual concession the members of the Committee have so much deference for each other, that they adopt without discussion one another’s humours, and instead of simplifying complicate the rules and make debate for the house.— This morning, all present except Wise and Dromgoole they agreed by my casting vote to strike out the hour rule. At the house—after the prayer by Mr Tustin, and the reading of the Journal the Clerk announced the select Committee on the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts, proposing an amendment to the Constitution—Adams, Rhett, Joseph R. Ingersoll, Gilmer, Garret Davis, Burke, Sample, Morse, and Giddings— The States and Territories were called through for petitions, in the course of half an hour— I had but one to present— Then came the call for Reports of Committees; and then for Resolutions. The first was that of Edmund Burke of New-Hampshire that the house will proceed on Thursday the 4th. of January to elect a Postmaster— The Calhounites had hitherto staved off this motion till now— They dared no longer to resist it— Burke moved the Resolution the previous question and the yeas and nays all at once— A motion to lay the resolution on the table was lost 73 to 84. The previous question was carried and the resolution itself 83. to 69. The quid pro quo for New-Hampshire sycophancy to the South is patronage, and Burke fairly dragooned them out of their bowels of compassion for M’Cormick, the present Postmaster— He must go.— Hale, another member from New-Hampshire, startled at an estimate of nine millions of dollars for the Navy, moved yesterday a retrenchment Resolution of enquiry about the home squadron.— Charles J. Ingersoll made this day made one of his snaky, rabid retrenchment speeches, against Hale’s motion, under colour of supporting it— Steenrod, moved the previous question— I said I should be glad to say a few words. He offered to withdraw if I would renew the motion. I declined— The house refused to sustain the previous question— I replied to Ingersoll— Hale took the floor again and the house adjourn. Coll. Twiggs and Mr Baldwin here this Evening. "

Twiggs and Mr Baldwin last evening was for the purpose of convincing me of the absolute necessity of remounting the second regiment of dragoons— In the reduction of the army which I urged with so much zeal and effect at the second Session of the 27th. Congress my purpose was to disband that regiment entirely, and it was carried by a large majority in the house— The Senate could only be brought to turn it into a rifle regiment, disbanding only the horses. There was an agonizing struggle the whole of the last Session; to repeal that part of the act of 23. August 1842. It failed and the horses were sold. And now the President recommends to remount the regiment, and Coll. Twiggs, and Mr Baldwin deem it indispensable— Mr John T. Towers publisher here of a newspaper called the Whig Standard, sent me an extra number of the paper containing my speech of last Friday as reported in the National Intelligencer of Saturday—with a note stating that he had a subscription to print a large edition of the Speech, and requesting me to revise the copy sent me; which I did last Evening; and I left it this morning at the Standard Office. Mr Towers shewed me the subscription list for the speech, which amounted to 4000 copies.— Committee on the revisal of the rules— Present Adams, Beardsley, White, Ingersoll, Davis, Vinton and Chapman— Absent Wise and Dromgoole.— The committee travelled through all the remainder of the existing rules, altering, amending, striking out, and adding.— They then adjourned to Saturday morning ten O’Clock when a fair copy of the code as amended by the Committee, is to be presented, for their final action and vote upon it— And with the exception of the striking out of the anti-petition rule, all the remainder of the report is not worth a wisp of straw.— Nay it is worse than nothing, and the existing rules form a less objectionable system than the adopted report— In the house numerous notices were given by different members of their intention to bring in Bills— A new practice, of which I believe—I myself set the first example.— Levy the Delegate from Florida presented charges against Samuel J. Douglas U.S. judge for the middle District of Florida which were referred to the judiciary Committee— The States were called through for petitions— Giddings presented one from a negro, claiming to be free, a citizen of Virginia, named William Jones, but now in jail here, and advertised to be sold for jail fees.— Giddings moved its reference to a select committee of five with power to send for persons and papers— Another explosion and the subject laid over because it gave rise to debate.— "

The record of yesterday must overflow upon this day— When Giddings presented the petition from the Negro William Jones now in Jail and advertised to be sold for Jail fees, the whole slave representation was up in arms—55 names are recorded in favour of a motion to lay the petition on the table— The Speaker ordered the whole subject to lie over because it raised debate. It was followed by a Resolution of John Campbell chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, from that Committee, for an Instruction to them to report a Bill for abolishing imprisonment for debt in the District of Columbia, which was carried—and then Hale’s motion of enquiry about the home squadron came up, and was debated till Weller moved the previous question, upon which a quorum could not be obtained to vote and the house adjourned— I had notified all the members of the select Committee on the Resolves of the Massachusetts Legislature, to meet this morning at ten in the room of the Committee of Commerce— When I notified R. B. Rhett, he answered that he received the notice, but immediately after the Speaker announced and read a Letter from Rhett to him asking to be excused from serving on that Committee— The house without opposition excused him I was riding to the Capitol this morning to attend the Committee, when I met Mr Grinnell walking to my house— I had promised him yesterday to go with him this morning to the pension office, and the engagement had slipped from my Memory. He now came in to my carriage came with me to the Capitol, and while I was attending the committee went with my granddaughter Mary Louisa, who had been in the carriage with me, to his lodgings— The meeting of the Committee lasted upwards of an hour. Present Adams Jos. R. Ingersoll, Gilmer, Garret Davis, Burke, Sample Morse and Giddings. As the appointment of the 9th. member in the place of Rhett had not been announced, it was agreed that nothing decisive should be done at this meeting, but Mr Gilmer offered a Resolution that the Amendment of the Constitution proposed by the Legislature of Massachusetts ought not to be recommended— A desultory conversation was held in which Gilmer and Ingersoll gave their opinions against the proposed amendments and Mr Giddings and myself in its favour. We adjourned to next Thursday. I then went with Mr Grinnell to the pension Office and signed a certificate that I was personally acquainted with the late Revd. Jonathan Burr, and his present widow, before and after their marriage which took place in 1788 or 89. This certificate was necessary to authenticate a claim of Mr Burr to a pension. "

Saturday  On returning yesterday from the pension Office to the Capitol, with Mr Grinnell, I found the house in Session, and just entering upon the discussion of the question what to do with the petition of William Jones, the negro claiming to be a free citizen of Virginia, but now in jail here, and advertised to be sold for jail fees— Saunders of North Carolina was arguing against any action of the house upon the petition.— So did John Campbell, Haralson, Payne and Cobb but the leaning of the house was too strong the other way— R. D. Davis made a very eccentric or disingenuous speech—denying that there was any desire in the North for the abolition of Slavery in the Southern States, and threatening an immediate dissolution of the Union by the North, if the Southern States, should immediately abolish Slavery— I presented a parallel, between the fire and fury with which the house on the 18th of June 1842, passed an act at the instigation of Edward D. White, to release from prison a white citizen of Louisiana and the torpid lethargy of the house on this occasion— The petition was finally referred to the Committee on the judiciary without instructions. A motion was then made to adjourn; but failed; the yeas and nays being called. Slidell moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole, to take up Charles J. Ingersoll’s bill to refund Jackson’s fine with 30 years interest.— The house went accordingly in to Committee, Davis of Indiana in the chair— Slidell made an hour speech for the Bill, but the passion to pass it was so red hot that it had not patience to hear him. Stephens of Georgia, moved an amendment to give the bill the form of a donation, with a proviso disclaiming all censure upon the censure of judge Hall, but it was scouted down insultingly— Past 4. O’Clock, Barnard moved an adjournment the rabblement shouted no—and growled pass the bill— Barnard set them at defiance—told them they would pass the bill, but the Senate would not, and was laying out for an hour of argument, when Charles J. Ingersoll told them there was no need of hurry, and moved the Committee to rise, which they did and the house adjourned.— Mr and Mrs Grinnell, left the City yesterday afternoon for the North. Mrs Grinnell is to go no farther than New-York— He is to go home to New Bedford and says he intends to leave home to return here next Monday week— Isaac Hull Adams came in last evening, from Quincy, and will pass the winter with us— Although the date of Saturday stands at the top of this page, the record is but a continuation of Friday— The house adjourned over to Tuesday 2. Jany 1844.  The multitude of Letters that I receive; the irresistible temptation which like the tide current of the Bay of Fundy imperceptibly urges me upon the breakers of every debate that arises in the house, and the disablement of my hand to write with despatch, crowd me to despatch— I received this morning from my Son a Letter noticing a gross blunder in the Resolves of the Legislature of Massachusetts, now referred to a select Committee, and for which I knew not how to account; and which it will be difficult to correct.— This morning at 10. I went to the Capitol to meet the Committee on the revisal of the rules— Only four members of the Committee met—Adams, Beardsley, C. J. Ingersoll and Vinton—no Quorum— Nevertheless, we proceeded to compare the copy made in the clerk’s office under French’s direction, of the Rules revised by the Committee with the copy on which the amendments agreed upon by them were minuted down, and we found some errors to be connected, and some rules requiring further revisal.— We adjourned to next Tuesday morning at 10, hoping that we shall then have a Quorum.— I have some concern about the manner of printing the report— The discussion in the house will be difficult and perplexed, unless the existing rules should be printed in parallel pages with the proposed revisal; and if they are, the chances are that the only important amendment made by the Committee, the exclusion of the gag-rule will not be adopted by the house; or be replaced by the substitute moved by Chapman ten times worse than the existing rule.— This I have no doubt is Wise’s real purpose, and that his solemn parade of renouncing all opposition to the reception of abolition petitions was a cheat— I borrowed in the Library, Roses Orlando Inamorato and Furioso, and found his sword Durindana in both of them— In the Law Library I borrowed the first Volume of a digest of the Pennsylvania Laws, containing the first Act of the Legislature of that State to abolish Slavery. I met Mr Giddings there and he gave me the document containing the report of the Secretary of War— I stop’d at the general Post Office, and gave the Postmaster General a Letter from Harley Sergeant, once a postmaster at Butternuts, New-York to Mr Tyson second assistant Postmaster General, now absent at Philadelphia— Mr Wickliffe said the Letter should be attended to "

Close of the year  With Isaac Hull Adams, and my granddaughter Mary-Louisa, I attended the morning public worship in the Hall of the House of Representatives. The Prayer was made and the hymn read, and by two lines at a time sung by Mr Tustin the chaplain to the Senate The Sermon was preached by the Revd. Mr Bacon, now President of the Columbian College, from John 12.32. “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me”— An edifying, but not very eloquent discourse— It was short—the whole service occupying not more than an hour— The Seats of the members were generally filled; though very few of them by themselves— We walked home with a bright Sun, a clear sky, and a frosty, but kindly Northwester.— After dinner at the second Presbyterian church, the Revd. James Knox preached from Ecclesiastes 3.15. the latter part of the verse— [“]And God required that which is past”— There is something obscure in the meaning of this sentence— It is in the chapter which teaches that to every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven— The meaning of the passage is that God repeats the past or in other words that there is nothing new under the Sun— Mr Knox discoursed upon it, as if it had been, God shall call men to account for that which is past, and made of it a fervid and minatory exhortation to repentance—a Subject never more appropriate than at the close of the year— The exhortation to repentance is indeed always in season, and the episcopal prayer book by prescribing it as a perpetual prayer, takes for granted that it is always needed and never effected. Always the same general confession of enormous sins, and prayer for pardon— Always the same promise of absolution upon true repentance and belief in the gospel— Do they not thus become mere forms of words, without meaning? And is the eternal scolding of a presbyterian preacher more efficacious to work out repentance or absolution? We had evening visits from General and Mrs Jesup—Dr Frye, Walter Hellen and Richard Cutts. I closed the year quietly in my writing chamber, grateful for the past— Praying for the future. "
