        <p>
        The Primary Source Cooperative (PSC) Lab Space is a collaboration between the Digital Scholarship Group
        (DSG) at Northeastern University Library and the Massachusetts Historical Society (MHS). The project aims to
        create data visualization derivatives from the transcription and XML work done by the editors of their
        respective editions at the MHS. These visualizations are both for broader scholarly research aided by
        digital humanities methodologies, but also for the public to engage with the digital collections at the MHS
        in new ways. As such, the visualizations are created from specific XML tagging done by the editors, and the
        visualizations also point back into the PSC archives at the MHS.
