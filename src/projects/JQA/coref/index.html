                    <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;"> John Quincy Adams’s (JQA) diary, which was inspired
                        by his father John Adams (JA) and started as a travel journal, initiated a lifelong writing
                        obsession. In 1779, twelve-year-old JQA made his second trip abroad to accompany his father’s
                        diplomatic mission. While in Europe, he attended various schools and traveled to St. Petersburg
                        as an interpreter during Francis Dana’s mission to Russia. He subsequently served as JA’s
                        secretary at Paris during the final months before the Anglo-American Definitive Peace Treaty was
                        signed in September 1783. Two years later, JQA returned to the US. After graduating from Harvard
                        College in 1787, he moved to Newburyport to read law under Theophilus Parsons and in 1790 he
                        established a legal practice in Boston. JQA’s skill as a writer brought him public acclaim, and
                        in 1794 President George Washington nominated him as US minister resident to the Netherlands.

                    <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">John Quincy Adams (JQA) entered diplomatic service
                        in September 1794 as US minister resident to the Netherlands. He married Louisa Catherine
                        Johnson (LCA) in July 1797 after a fourteen-month engagement, and their three sons were born in
                        this period. During his father John Adams’s (JA) presidency they moved to Berlin where, as US
                        minister plenipotentiary, JQA signed a new Prussian-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce. JQA
                        returned to the US in 1801 and entered politics, elected first to the Massachusetts senate in
                        1802 and then to the US Senate in 1803. His contentious relationship with fellow Federalist
                        members over his support of some Democratic-Republican policies led to his removal from office.
                        In May 1808 the Federalist-controlled Massachusetts legislature voted to replace him at the end
                        of his term, prompting JQA’s resignation in June. Between 1806 and 1809 he also served as the
                        first Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard.</p><br><br>

                        service in August 1809 as the US’s first minister plenipotentiary to Russia. In St. Petersburg
                        JQA was well-liked by Emperor Alexander I and closely followed the battles of the Napoleonic
                        Wars then raging across Europe. When the US declared war on Great Britain in 1812, Adams watched
                        from afar as the conflict dragged on for two years. In April 1814, he traveled to Ghent,
                        Belgium, as part of the US delegation to negotiate an end to the war with England; the Treaty of
                        Ghent was signed on Christmas Eve. Subsequently appointed US minister to the Court of St.
                        James’s in May 1815, JQA served in London for the next two years.</p><br><br>

                    <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">John Quincy Adams (JQA) served as the US secretary
                        of state during James Monroe’s presidency. Adams’s duties included organizing and responding to
                        all State Department correspondence and negotiating agreements beneficial to the US. His
                        achievements as secretary of state include the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which
                        established the US border with Canada along the 49th parallel, and the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819
                        (Transcontinental Treaty), which resulted in the US acquisition of Florida. JQA also formulated
                        the policy that became known as the Monroe Doctrine, in which the US called for European
                        non-intervention in the western hemisphere, specifically in the affairs of newly independent
                        Latin American nations. As Monroe’s presidency came to an end, JQA was among the top candidates
                        in the 1824 presidential election. When no candidate earned the necessary majority, the House of
                        Representatives decided the election in JQA’s favor in February 1825.</p><br><br>

                        president of the US on 4 March 1825 and began his administration with an ambitious agenda of
                        improvements for American society. His presidency was embattled. Supporters of Andrew Jackson,
                        who believed their candidate had unfairly lost the 1824 election, worked ceaselessly to foil
                        JQA’s plans. Domestically, JQA refused to replace civil servants with partisan supporters, and
                        his administration became involved in disputes between the Creek Nation and the state of
                        Georgia. JQA’s foreign policy also suffered, as partisan bickering in Congress failed to provide
                        timely funding for US delegates to attend the 1826 Congress of Panama. Political mudslinging in
                        advance of the 1828 presidential election was particularly fierce, and by mid-1827 JQA knew he
                        would not be reelected.</p><br><br>

                        former president to subsequently serve in the US House of Representatives. As the chairman of
                        the House Committee on Manufactures, he helped compose the compromise tariff bill of 1832. He
                        traveled to Philadelphia as part of a committee that investigated the Bank of the United States,
                        drafting a minority report in support of rechartering the bank after disagreeing with the
                        committee’s majority report. JQA regularly presented the antislavery petitions he received from
                        across the country, and he vehemently opposed the passage of the Gag Rule in 1836 that prevented
                        House discussion of petitions related to slavery. He opposed the annexation of Texas, and in
                        1838 he delivered a marathon speech condemning the evils of slavery. JQA also chaired the
                        committee that oversaw the bequest of James Smithson, which was used to establish the
                        Smithsonian Institution.</p><br><br>

                        Representatives, John Quincy Adams (JQA) continued to oppose the Gag Rule that prevented House
                        discussion of petitions related to slavery. In 1839 he joined the defense team for the Africans
                        who revolted aboard the Spanish slave ship Amistad. The Supreme Court declared the Amistad
                        Africans free on 9 March 1841 after JQA delivered oral arguments in their favor. In 1842 JQA
                        faced a censure hearing and ably defended himself against charges from southern congressmen. He
                        introduced a successful resolution that finally led to the repeal of the Gag Rule in 1844. JQA
                        voted against both the annexation of Texas in 1845 and the US declaration of war with Mexico in
                        1846. He collapsed on the floor of the House on 21 February 1848 and died two days later.</p>
