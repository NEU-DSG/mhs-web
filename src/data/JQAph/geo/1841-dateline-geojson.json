                "text": "2. VI: Saturday.  A fair day, but cold— These are visitors who were prevented from calling yesterday, by the weather. Governor Lincoln came alone, and I had a long conversation with him on the present state and prospective movements of parties— The Governor gave me to understand that he knew Webster was to be Harrison’s Secretary of State, but left it rather uncertain whether he had it from himself, or from good authority— He said Mr Stephen C. Phillips had told him he had it directly from Webster.— I asked him whether Mr Webster had consulted or communicated with him concerning any measures which were to indicate the principles upon which the administration would be conducted— He said Mr Webster had once commenced a conversation with him, in which he had answered some enquiries, by assurances that all would be right—that the expectations of the friends of General Harrison would be gratified, but that he had not then time to enter into details and thus avoided all specification. I enquired if he knew who was to be the Secretary of the Treasury and whether John Sergeant or Thaddeus Stevens was to be the representative of Pennsylvania, in the new administration— He did not know— He had attended several meetings of the whig members, for consultation and comparison of opinions; but had found so much dissension among them, that he had ceased to attend the meetings. He had heard at the commencement of the Session, much and loud interest among the Pennsylvanians, in the appointment of Mr Sergeant to the Treasury—but within the last fortnight all this has been hushed, and he had not heard even the name of Mr Sergeant mentioned— Mr Thaddeus Stevens is now here, and has been for some days, and there is much said of his claims to notice and distinction from General Harrison and his friends—and there seems to be an effort from the Western part of Pennsylvania, for the exclusion of Sergeant from the Harrison Cabinet. I said that Sergeant was an old and intimate friend of mine—a very able, and very honest, though a timid politician— That I should be glad to see him at the head of the Treasury Department; and at this moment I supposed the fact of his appointment or exclusion, would disclose the policy of the Harrison Administration for, or against a national Bank— I had also some conversation but not of much import, with Mr. Saltonstall— I dined with my neighbour Mr Daniel D. Barnard, member of the house of Representatives from the Albany District of New-York— Mrs Barnard, his daughter by his first wife, Cora, and his little daughter by his present wife, Sarah were there. Major General Winfield Scott, Daniel Jenifer, member from Maryland, and William Crosby Dawson member from Georgia, and nominated candidate for Governor of that State were the company, and it was more of Schoolboys in the Holidays, than of Military commanders and grey-bearded Statesmen— The motto of the meeting was Swifts Vive la bagatelle— I came home before 8. p.m. "

Mr Cookman preached, from Revelation 21.5. first clause of the verse: “And he, that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.” A New-Year’s discourse—begun with general remarks upon the irresistible charm of novelty to all mankind—illustrated not only by the character ascribed in Scripture to the Athenians at the time of the preaching of Paul, but by the history of mankind in all ages, and by our own experience and consciousness—the passion for novelty being felt by us all from the highest concerns of life down to the mere fashions of wearing apparel, so that we are almost ashamed to be seen in a dress which but six months before was the very pink of the fashion— Then he said that all the books of the world together contained not a hundredth part of matter, gratifying to the passion for novelty, as was in the Bible— I thought it whimsical that the oldest book in the world should be cited for its transcendant novelty; but the position was maintained in the sense in which the preacher had taken it, with equal ingenuity and energy— All the miracles recorded in the Bible are novelties— The creation of the world is the greatest of all novelties, and Mr Cookman after reading the first four verses of the book of Genesis fell into a trance of extasy, at the speaking into existence of light— Then he quoted some of the prophetic sublimities of Isaiah; and one from Habakkuk. Then he passed to the New Testament—to the lowly birth of the Saviour, solemnized by the songs of angels—to the preaching of the gospel to the poor. To the selection of Apostles from fishermen, from publicans, from a bigoted and persecuting pharisee— Then to the triumphs of the cross and the overthrow of the whole heathen mythology, by the crucifixion of Jesus. Mr Cookman finished with a rhapsody upon the progressive improvement of the condition of mankind, and congratulated somewhat indiscreetly his auditory, upon the political conversions effected within the last six Months, by the addresses of many of the most distinguished men of this Country to popular assemblies. He concluded by a direct address to the members of both houses of Congress, of whom there might be 20 present, wishing them all happiness and prosperity for this, and many succeeding years— Mary Cutts was here before dinner— Evening service at St. John’s Church. Mr. Hawley read prayers for the second Sunday after Christmas—and preached very briefly upon 2. Corinthians 4.17. “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us, a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory.” Evening so cold that I could not write— I was obliged to employ it in reading, and nearly read through the record prepared for the Supreme Court in the case of the Amistad Negroes.

King of Georgia took his seat, and Francis Mallory appeared and was sworn, as a Member from the Norfolk District in Virginia, in the place of Holleman, resigned— A Letter from Garland the Clerk, in answer to the complaint of Blair and Rives, was referred to the select Committee on the subject— The States were called for Petitions, and I presented 5. from 16 to 21.—one of which was refused to be received— Two for rescinding the gag-rule— I moved the reference of each of them to a select Committee with instructions to report a Resolution to rescind the rule— Linn Banks in each case moved to lay on the table—and they were laid on the table— Two Petitions numerously signed from the State of New-York, referred to the Committee on the judiciary; the Chairman of which John Sergeant has been here scarcely 3. days since the commencement of the Session— The Committees were called for Reports— M’Kay and Medill ungraciously consented that I should present the report which I had prepared on the falsified document N. 185. which I accordingly did present— It concluded with a motion that the Committee should be discharged from the further consideration of the subject which was adopted, and the report and testimony were laid on the table, and ordered to be printed— After the reports of Committees, Mr D. D. Barnard’s Resolution for a call on the Secretary of the Treasury, relating to the state of the finances came up— It was already long and he lengthened it by a modification— He had spoken less than half an hour, and was proving the smaller blunders in the report of the Secretary, when a Message from the President came in— Albert Smith immediately began to bustle and wriggle about the house to get at the message. He finally moved to proceed to the orders of the day which was carried by yeas and nays, 79 to 62. The message contained a sharp correspondence between the Secretary of State and the British Minister Fox, which kindled a faggot flame in the house: it burnt fiercely for upwards of an hour, and ended by a reference to the Committee of foreign relations of the message— The remarkable part of this affair is the tone assumed by Fox at this time— Immediately after the reference of the Message the house at 20 minutes past 3. adjourned— While we were at dinner a man named Piggot came with a project of some patent invention, for compendious teaching of Arithmetic, for which he wanted my subscription, and recommendation— I read his paper, but could not understand it, and therefore declined subscription or recommendation. At 7. p.m. Mr Joel R. Poinsett, Secretary of War, delivered at the Baptist Church in 10th. Street an excellent Discourse on the formation and purposes of the National Institution for the promotion of Science and the arts, at wh I attended— "

Tuesday—  Mr Martin, chief clerk in the Department of State came this morning, to say that there would yet be some days before the answer could be transmitted to the call for documents relating to our intercourse with China— The Message received some days since from the President was in answer to another Call— I met the Committee of manufactures this morning at half past 10— Present Adams, Nisbet, Tillinghast, Davis, Slade, Mitchell, Eastman—absent Dromgoole and Worthington. There was a long discussion upon the expediency of reporting the remainder of the bill to secure more effectively the collection of the revenue, lost at the heel of the last Session, that is the additional bill, which the Senate tacked upon the one which had passed the house— Tillinghast proposed and urged it upon various considerations— Davis of Pennsylvania, who at the last Session struck with palsy all action of the Committee and of the house in favour of the manufactures and lost his election for this subserviency to the Southern policy was now quite obstreperous for this revision of the Tariff at this time— Slade rather inclined to report the Senatorial revenue splice upon our bill, but wished to amend it, and make it more intelligible— Nisbet was utterly against reporting the bill at all, and so was I—he moved to lay the whole subject on the table for the remainder of the Session. After much debate it was agreed to postpone the further consideration of the subject for the present; and I gave notice of my intention to move again the resolution, which I lost in Committee at the last Session. The Letter from the Secretary of the Treasury to me, with five enclosures was read, and two or three references from the house—and the Committee adjourned to next Tuesday morning, at half past ten. In the house Calvary Morris offered a Resolution for a Committee of enquiry into the condition of Lunatics in the district of Columbia. W. Cost Johnson Chairman of the Committee on the District said they had a Bill ready prepared on the subject, and on which he should invoke the early action of the house—upon which Morris withdrew his motion— The special order of the day was the contested election for the 3d. congressional district of Pennsylvania— Medill moved that Charles J. Ingersoll should be heard at the bar of the house in support of his petition, as well as the sitting member, whereupon a long and very unprofitable debate arose on sundry questions, how and upon what points Ingersoll should be heard. He was at last admitted without limitation, and addressed the house till 3. O’Clock when they adjourned— I went into the Office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court and looked at the Manuscript copy of the record in the Amistad captives case— The printed copy is full of errors. This evening I had a visit from Mr James H. Hackett the actor, with whom I had a pleasant conversation upon some of the characters and plays of Shakespear—and he promised to send me some of his own strictures upon Lear. "

Slushy Streets—  A boy came from the Globe Office this morning with the copy of my report, made by a Clerk in the Office of the Clerk of the house, in the case of the falsified document N. 185 and sent to the Globe Office to be printed— There was a mark in red pencil under the letter o. in the word Ladino in the second specification of variance from the manuscript in the printed document—the boys enquiry was whether the word at this place in the manuscript report should not be Ladina. I took the paper to the capitol and on comparing it with the manuscript from the Department of State found the word was Ladina—wrote with a black pencil on the paper that it should be so and gave the paper to Mr Berry of the Clerks Office, to be sent immediately back to the printing Office— The whole of these transactions goes to prove the extreme difficulty and yet the extreme importance of printing, and of copying manuscript correctly—especially of public documents— It teaches a prudent man to be vigilant for the detection of errors, and a candid man to be distrustful of his own suspicions in the imputation of motives— I have discovered several errors, of translation of copying and of printing, in these documents, and especially both in the manuscript record transmitted from the circuit to the Supreme Court and in the printed copy of it— I went in to the Library and borrowed the 14th. Volume of Peters’s Reports, a Volume of the Laws of New-York, containing the Constitution of the State and Jefferson’s Notes on Virginia— In the house, John W. Jones Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, reported the army appropriation Bill— I enquired when the civil, and diplomatic appropriation Bill might be expected—he said within the 30 days from the time of the appointment of the Committee allowed by the rule. There was a report from a select Committee about the breaking down of the chandelier—that no person was to blame—that it must be paid for, and the wreck taken in part payment by the makers. W. Cost Johnson by suspension of the rules obtained leave to bring up his Bill for transporting the Lunatics of the District to Baltimore— Committee of the whole, Lewis Williams in the Chair— Johnson had drawn his Bill so carelessly and drove it along so stubbornly and heedlessly that he lost it at the 3d. reading by yeas and nays. 72 to 82. A motion for reconsideration was immediately made by Mr Fillmore to re-instate the Bill and limit its duration to two years; but the orders of the day were called, and Mr Charles J. Ingersoll resumed his speech against the election of Charles Naylor and in favour of his own— He closed about 3. O’Clock and Naylor rose and addressed the Speaker. The house immediately adjourned— I rode home, and spent the Evening in writing— Oppressed with trivial researches— "

Thursday—  Mr Van Ness called upon me this morning and spoke of his argument before the Supreme Court of the State of Vermont in the case of Dr Holmes the Canadian Murderer. I had enquired of Mr. Slade whether he could furnish me the argument of Mr Van Ness on this case before the Supreme Court of Vermont. He said he would ask Mr Van Ness himself for it, he being here. Mr Van Ness now told me that he had not a copy of it at hand, but observed that he had sent one to Mr Isaac Fletcher a member of the house from Vermont, for me, last Summer, which is true—but I have mislaid it. Mr Van Ness is here, engaged with some claims before a joint commission, for the settlement of certain claims against the Mexican Government; and he enquired what had been the reason for inserting in the Florida Treaty with Spain in the Article establishing a Commission for the adjustment of claims, a limitation of the claims to those in support of which the interposition of the Government had been solicited— I told him it was for the sake of fixing the amount of the sum to be paid by Spain, and for the sake of including within the reference the claim of Mr Mead, which Spain might otherwise have excluded, as one with which the government of the United States had no right to interfere— A man named Mark a native of Hanover in Germany came to enquire if I had the disposal of any portion of the Smithsonian fund—and to inform me that a man by the name of Löwenberg at New-York had the very finest and most perfect Telescope in the world for sale— I enquired what price he would ask for it—he said 3000 dollars; but he would take half that sum for it.— I referred him to the Secretary of the Treasury as the person who had in charge the Smithsonian fund.— In the house Mr Naylor had the floor to answer Charles J. Ingersoll, but was so much indisposed that he desired it might be postponed till to-morrow; and as that, and Saturday will be private bill days it was postponed, not without opposition till Monday— Mr Fillmore’s motion to reconsider the rejection of the Lunatic bill followed. It was reconsidered—taken up in Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, Lincoln in the chair; Lewis Williams having requested to be excused— The bill was amended—limited, reported to the house; passed to the third reading passed by yeas and nays 110 to 60, in spite of the snorting of Hubbard of Alabama one of the nuisances of the house— Reports from the heads of Departments, Bills from the Senate, and Reports from the Committees came in succession— Cushing moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the French spoliation bill—ayes 55 noes 73. lost. Adjourned at 3— I was twice at the Clerk’s Office of the Supreme Court examining the record in the Amistad case which occupied also the whole evening. "

The vote upon Everett’s motion to suspend the rules was 99 to 53. not quite two thirds and therefore lost— Curtis from the Committee on Commerce offered a Bill for granting a register or license to the Schooner L’Amistad— Pickens objected, but Curtis moved a suspension of the rules which was carried and the Bill was read 3 times and passed— Turney moved to adjourn because it was the 8th. of January— Stanly called for the yeas and nays which were 19 to 163.— One private Bill was rejected and one passed to the third reading.— Adjourned at 3.

I had received yesterday a Letter, from the four persons first named in the margin, announcing themselves as a Committee from the importing merchants of New-York, and requesting an interview, with me at my convenience— I answered that I would with pleasure receive them at my house at ten o’clock this morning. They accordingly came, and said they had been appointed to represent the objections of the importing merchants of New-York against parts of the Bill N. 556. of the present Session to ensure the more faithful execution of the laws, relating to the collection of duties on imports. They declared themselves anxiously desirous for the suppression of frauds and would not object to most of the provisions of the bill, though they believed the existing laws amply sufficient if faithfully executed— That the frauds which had been committed by the yorkshire importers at New-York had been effected by corrupt connivence of subordinate officers of the customs, and not by any defect in the Law. I heard all they had to say; and told them that the Committee of manufactures would meet next Tuesday morning at half-past ten; and I proposed to them to attend that meeting; and to come prepared with their objections to the bill reduced to writing; to which they assented— As they went out Miss Margaret Monroe Stuart came in—a maiden Lady, who in the compass of half an hour uttered in one continued stream, more good words than I could record in three months— Her Sister is the wife of Captain Gedney, who is here very sick; and she fears not very sound in mind— She came to intreat me, in arguing the Amistad case before the Supreme Court, I would not bear hard upon Captain Gedney; for she fears it might kill him, and she is sure it would kill her Sister— I assured her that I would have all due consideration of the condition of Captain Gedney— In the House my Resolution Call upon the Postmaster General for a list of Postmasters removed came up, and was entangled with a budget of seven controversial Resolutions about the powers of the President and the rights of the house— The Speaker pronounced this amendment proposed by Hopkins in order— I appealed— The appeal was laid on the table 95 to 80— The house refused to lay the whole subject on the table 92 to 84— The Resolution and Amendment were ordered to be printed.— In the Clerk’s Office of the Supreme Court, I found my name on both rolls of Attornies and Counsellors. 7. Feby 1804. Miss Cutts dined with us, and Connell spent the Evening here. "

                "text": "10. VI. Sunday.  I attended, with Mr Smith this morning, public worship at the Capitol, where the Chaplain of the house Mr Braxton preached a Sermon of an hour from John 3.7. “Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again.” about as shallow and superficial a discourse as it was ever my lot to hear, explaining into ten fold obscurity what was dark enough before— There were however at the close of the argument certain benevolent, affectionate and unctuous exhortations, which bespoke indulgence for the preacher and made up for all deficiencies of intellect— The auditory was thin; not more than half the seats of the members being filled, nobody in the galleries, and no baptist choir to sing; as there was this day fortnight. After the service, Jonathan Elliot at the request of Mr Braxton, introduced him to me— He enquired if I had been acquainted with his father or grandfather— I had not—but I said his grandfather was universally known as one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence— Of his father I had never heard. His father he said must have been about of my age— He said that his father and forefathers had been episcopalians, but he had become a dissenter, and a member of the baptist church which he preferred to all the other denominations— He said he was pleased to find that many of the members of Congress were religious men— That they had prayer meetings every Saturday Evening; and that many of the members attended them. This was news to me— There were precious few members of Congress in attendance this day— I called with Mr Smith, at Mrs Ballard’s, on the Capitol hill, and saw Mr Pope who lodges there— He was seized yesterday with a vertigo as he was rising from the dinner table; and said he thought for some time he was going off hand to kingdom come—he seized hold of the table to steady himself, but the table danced round the room— One of his friends supported him, but the house itself was sinking and swinging round him— He recovered himself however in a short time, and walked to and fro, with-out his hat, in the Street in front of his lodgings for an hour till he recovered— He is now trying the remedy of abstinence. While we were there, Joseph L. Williams member of the house from Tennessee and Judge Catron of the Supreme Court, also from Tennessee came in— The Session of the Court commences to-morrow— Judge Catron says that the Chief Justice, Roger B. Taney is very frail, and cannot last long— I visited also at Mrs Arguelles’s, Mr Crabb of Alabama, with whom I found Stanly of North-Carolina— They had visited me together— After dinner at St. John’s church, Mr Hawley read prayers for the first Sunday after the Epiphany, and preached from Matthew 9.29. [“]Then touched he their eyes, saying, according to your faith, be it unto you[”]— Evening consumed in reading Amistad Documents. "

It was the day for the presentation of Petitions in the house, and I attended at the commencement of the sitting, but immediately after the reading of the Journal I moved an amendment of it. The entry was that Hopkins had moved to strike out of my Resolution call on the Postmaster General all after the word resolved, and insert his eight resolutions— But he did not move to strike out any part of my resolution, but only wished me to accept his in addition to mine— The Speaker said it was so, and directed the amendment to be made in the Journal— French the Chief Clerk came to my seat and shewed me Hopkins’s Resolutions in which there was not a word about striking out mine: but French said he thought it was necessarily implied— The Speaker then immediately announced the special order of the day, the contested Pennsylvania election, and that Naylor had the floor— He occupied it about 3 hours, in answer to Charles J. Ingersoll; and being much exhausted, yielded to a motion for adjournment by Toland— John W. Jones by general consent reported from the Committee of Ways and Means the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill; and the house adjourned after three. I rode home with D. D. Barnard— Before I went to the house Redmon Burk the Stone cutter came to intreat again employment—work— He has a wife and children, and brought a certificate from Walker supervisor of the work on the patent Office, in his favour— At the Office of the Clerk of the House, I had several Petitions which had been presented at former Sessions, taken from the files; and with their papers referred to the Committees of Commerce and of Roads and Canals. I had thought they would be referred of course, under a general order of the house passed at the commencement of the Session—but I find that none of them is referred, unless at the special instance of those who had charge of them at the preceding Sessions— The Supreme Court met this day at Noon— I went into their room twenty minutes after and they had just adjourned— All the judges were here, excepting Story and Thomson—detained on the way by obstructions to the travelling by storms and floods.— Mr Hackett the Actor was here this Evening, and had an hour’s conversation with me upon Lear, Falstaff and Hamlet— He gave me quite a pathetic account of the death of Edmund Kean. He goes to-morrow for New-York and Charleston— There was this Evening a meeting of the Institution for the promotion of Science and the Arts, at which I intended to have been present, but was deterred by unfavourable weather; and by necessary to the Amistad negroes case— I employed the whole Evening in reading and writing upon it— But it presents itself every day to me in a new aspect—and I still know not how to present it to the Court— "

A Poet in his own estimation quite equal to Milton— A Painter of two wretched daubs, which have been suspended in the Rotundo, for sale, and which he urged me to purchase— I told him I could not afford to purchase pictures—he said it might be a very profitable investment of money; for that pictures for example of Raphael, Titian, Rubens or West increased greatly in price, the older they grew— The man is poor, and feeds upon his fancies— Meeting of the Committee of Manufactures—present Adams, Tillinghast, Nisbet, Davis, Eastman and Slade. absent, Dromgoole, Worthington, and Mitchell— The Committee from the New-York importing merchants attended, and presented a printed statement of the amendments which they proposed to the bill, which they verbally explained and expounded—some of the amendments will probably be recommended by the Committee to the house— Their deportment was far more respectful to the Committee than that of the last Summer had been— Underwood appears to be the most intelligent of the four— Hutton was of the last Summer’s committee— Swan and Bent are said to be deeply concerned in foreign houses; and I have received anonymous Letters from New-York tending to raise distrust of them all. But as I always distrust anonymous Letters, I give little credit to them— Two Letters, from the Secretary of the Treasury, with enclosures from the Collector at New-York were read, and Mr Tillinghast drew a bill, which he was authorised to report to the house for levying a duty, of 20 per cent ad valorem upon imported pins. In the house I obtained leave to present the petition of Burk and Wex, the Stone cutters for work, and it was referred to the Committee on the public buildings. Naylor gave way for the morning hour— Sergeant from the judiciary Committee reported sundry bills from the Senate to one of which concerning the abolition of imprisonment for debt I proposed an amendment—which after some discussion was rejected. Naylor resumed his argument in support of his election and in answer to C. J. Ingersoll, till 3. O’Clock when the house adjourned. Meantime Mr Roger Sherman Baldwin, of New-Haven, Counsel for the Amistad Prisoners came into the House, and I had a long conversation with him, first without the Bar, and then in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, concerning their case— He read me his brief, which I signed with him— He proposes to begin with a motion to the Court to dismiss the case, on the ground, that the United States having no interest in the case have no right to appeal from the decision of the District judge— I must follow him; but know not yet how to order my Speech aright— When I came home I found my wife much indisposed with an attack of Erisypelas— She soon took to her bed.

Mr Pierrepont is from Brooklyn, Long Island: a claimant of indemnity for French spoliations prior to the year 1800.— He came to ask my assistance in support of the Bill making provision for that indemnity, which he said Mr Cushing had informed some of the claimants, he expected would come up for consideration to-morrow. I said I thought the Pennsylvania election would occupy to-morrow, and at least all the remainder of this week—but that whenever it should come up, I would give it all the assistance in my power.— Mr Pierrepont is one of a Committee of the association at Brooklyn who have invited me to deliver a Lecture there upon the history of libraries— I received that invitation sometime since; and with multitudes of others it remains unanswered— Mr Pierrepont mentioned it to me, and I told him I was unable to answer it at present— I thought it would be impracticable; and wished him to communicate this to the Society as my answer. but if, after the close of the Session of Congress, I should have leisure, I would undertake the task, and would give due notice to the Society of the time when I shall be prepared to deliver the Lecture— He was satisfied with this— I rode with Mr Smith to and from the Capitol— Attended first at the Supreme Court, which meets at 11. O’Clock— The chief Justice and six other Judges were on the bench but the judges Story and Thomson were not there— A land cause, in which David B. Ogden and F. Key were the Counsel of the parties was taken up— I met Mr. Baldwin there, and introduced him to the Attorney General Gilpin— After a few minutes I took Mr Baldwin into the Congress Library, introduced him to the Librarian Meehan, and went with him into the Library Room of the Supreme Court— There I left him looking up the books that he wanted, and went into the house; where immediately after the reading of the Journal Naylor resumed his argument and continued till past 3 O’Clock without finishing. I had heard enough on both sides to satisfy me of the vote that I am to give in the case, and I went into the Senate chamber to speak to Mr Webster about the bill for granting certificates of enrollment to the purchaser of the Amistad— The Senate chamber was full of members of the house listening to an argument against a pre-emption bill of Benton’s and an amendment of Calhouns to give away the public Lands— I heard Preston for about an hour,—and think him the most accomplished Orator now in the house— Oh! for his elocution! I returned to the house, and moved that the Bill N. 311. of last Session to increase the duties on the importation of silks, should be made the special order of the day for this day fortnight— Opposed by John W. Jones and all the South. After a short discussion, question taken by yeas and nays—64 to 52. no quorum, and adjournment moved by Hubbard of Alabama and carried— My wife is better, but confined to her bed "

Another dull and gloomy day—my wife continuing better, but still confined to her bed— Mary rode with me to the Capitol where I went into the Supreme Court room just before the judges came and opened the court— F. Key, the District Attorney came to me, and enquired when the case of the Blacks was to come on— I said we had filed a motion to the Court to dismiss the cause, which I understood was to come up for argument on Saturday— He said he was afraid there was not any chance for the poor creatures— That the case of the Antelope, was precisely in point against them— He had argued that case for the freedom of the negroes, but it had been overruled— Yet it never would do to send them back to Cuba— The best thing that could be done was to make up a purse and pay for them and then send them back to Africa— I said we hoped to prove that the case of the Antelope, would not be conclusive in its bearing upon our clients; but he continued very positive in the impression that it would— I went therefore into the Supreme Court Library room: and took out the volume of Wheaton’s Reports containing the case of the Antelope— I read as much of it as I could—and longed to comment upon it as I would—but I have neither time nor head for it—nothing but the heart— In the house after the reading of the Journal, the question upon making my silk bill the special order for Wednesday the 27th. was the first thing that came up— I moved for a call of the house which was refused— The vote on the question’s being taken was 78 to 64. and the majority not amounting to two thirds my motion was lost.— After some snarling by Rives of Virginia, Naylor resumed his argument in support of his right to his seat— He increased in vehemence as he proceeded, till in hoarseness he almost lost distinct articulation, and at a quarter past 3. he concluded—not that he had finished, but from absolute exhaustion— Ingersoll rose to reply; but the house adjourned after a suspension of the rules for John W. Jones to move to make his five Million Treasury Note Bill, the special order for next Monday.— Barnard moved an amendment to instruct the Committee of Ways and Means to bring in a Bill for a loan of ten Millions of dollars, and to levy duties on silks, wines and spices,—but the Speaker declared it not in order;—Willis Green offered a Resolution of much the same purport, but could not obtain a suspension of the rules to offer it— D. D. Barnard from the Committee on the judiciary did obtain leave to report the Bill which passed the Senate at the last Session,— He moved to make it a special order; but the house adjourned— Waddy Thomson came to my Seat and enquired what allowances were made to ministers going abroad— I told him, and asked if he had any particular interest in making the enquiry—he said in confidence that he had— I pursued this Evening my examination of the Documents in the case of the Amistad captives, but am yet utterly unprepared for the argument.

A succession of visitors this morning aggravated the burden already heavier than I can bear of my indispensable occupations— Mr Bond, a member of the house of Representatives from the State of Ohio came and introduced Mr Leonard, a member of the bar in that State, now in attendance upon the Session of the Supreme Court of the United States— While they were here, Mr Hawley came with Mr Anthon, an episcopal Clergyman of the City of New-York— And then Mr Masters a youth recent from college, a son of Mrs Masters, sister of my deceased brother in Law Coll. William Stephens Smith— I was obliged to leave Mr Masters with his cousin and called at the Department of State, where the Chief Clerk, Mr Martin shewed me the Letter from Holabird U.S. District Attorney in Connecticut, of 21. Septr. 1839.— In the manuscript Document, printed as N. 185 of the last Session, and in the printed copy of it, this Letter is made to state that the U.S. Circuit Court had decided that it had jurisdiction of any Offence, committed by the blacks on board of the Amistad—the word no after had, in the original Letter, was omitted in the manuscript copy transmitted to the house; and in the document— I said that I should want a certificate from the Department that this word no was in the original Letter. Martin said he would send me a certified copy of the Letter.— But I knew he would not, for on reading the Letter I saw it was garbled in the copy transmitted to the house— In the Letter after stating that the Court had doubts as to the habeas corpus, he declares his fears of the result, and adds I should regret extremely that the rascally blacks, should fall into the hands of the abolitionists with whom Hartford is filled.— Meeting Mr Baldwin in the Court Library, I told him that Martin had promised me a copy of Holabird’s Letter but that he would break his promise—and I repeated to him the suppressed paragraph— In the House D. D. Barnard’s motion to make the bankrupt Bill the special order for the 28th. was rejected 57 to 94.— C. J. Ingersoll replied in a Speech of nearly two hours to Naylor, who rejoined with a few words— Jameson then moved the previous question, on the Resolution of the majority of the Committee— There was a call of the house—sundry dilatory motions, all voted down—the previous question carried, and the Resolution that Naylor was duly elected for the 3d. Congressional District of Pennsylvania, adopted 117 to 85. and the house adjourned— I heartily congratulated Naylor— Evening deeply absorbed in the Amistad. "

This day the motion signed by Mr Baldwin and myself, and filed by him in the Supreme Court, to dismiss the appeal by the United States from the Decree of the District and Circuit Courts, in the case of the Amistad captives, was to have been argued— Saturday being by the rules of the Court the weekly day for the argument of motions— I was not half prepared, and went to the Court with a heavy heart, fill of undigested thought—sure of the justice of my Cause; and deeply desponding of my ability to sustain it— When the Court was opened the Chief Justice, Roger B. Taney said that the Court had thought it best to postpone the Amistad case, to await the arrival of judge Story, who was expected to be here on Monday or Tuesday. It was desirable that there should be a full Court for the hearing of the case; and the Court would take it up, on any day of the week immediately after his arrival— Mr Baldwin stated that he was under a necessity of leaving this city next Saturday to attend a Court in Connecticut. The postponement of the case, afforded me a momentary relief, but, left a state of suspense scarcely less distressing than the agony of the ordeal itself— In the house Toland came to my seat, and said there was talk of a motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday declaring Naylor entitled to his Seat; and enquired if I thought such a motion was receivable upon a decision of the house in its judicial capacity. I said it ought not to be—but that I could answer for nothing from the majority of this house— He said if the motion should be made he should resist it, and asked if I would sustain him— I said I would—but the motion was not made. Campbell, Chairman of the Committee of Elections, moved a suspension of the rules for a Resolution authorising the allowance of the pay and mileage of a member for the Commencement of this Congress till the decision of the house against him— But instead of a vote of two thirds, he could scarcely obtain a vote of one third of the house to suspend the rules— Proffit also moved a suspension of the rules for a satirical call upon the Secretary of the Treasury. A Tennessee land-bill raised a debate some of the members from that State and others from North Carolina, till arrested by the expiration of the morning hour— A number of private bills were then disposed of in Committee of the whole—Briggs in the chair. among the rest, a Bill reported by the Committee of claims for the relief of Nathaniel Goddard and others, among whom Thomas H. Perkins, owners of the ship Ariadne and cargo, which Turney opposed because Perkins was a member of the Hartford Convention— He moved to strike out the enacting clause, which was carried— Several other Bills were passed upon, and reported to the house where the discussion upon the Hartford Convention was renewed, but no question taken—adjourned near 4.

Rainy Night and morning. as the rain subsided I walked to the Capitol and heard Mr Cookman preach from James 1.26 [“]If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain. 27. Pure religion and undefiled before God, and the father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows, in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.” He began by observing, that among the first followers of Jesus Christ James was the great apostle and champion of practical religion— Then he discoursed largely, and most instructively upon the necessity of bridling the tongue, gathered a number of passages of scripture elucidating that position—descanted upon the mysterious identification of the word, with God—contrasted the confusion of tongues at the confusion of Babel, and the gift of fiery tongues at the miracle of the Pentecost— He spoke of the wonderful power and influen of speech for good or for evil in the lives, history and atchievements of Demosthenes and Cicero of Chatham and Patrick Henry—of Danton, Robespierre and Marat.— Thence he passed to the second verse of his text, to the thrice repeated exhortation to purity, in the phraseology of the text, its indissoluble connection with religion—its utter aversion to and horror of hypocrisy.— He marked the gentle, quiet, humane, benevolent Spirit with which this pure and undefiled religion makes her way and settles herself in every humble dwelling in the valley and upon every mountaintop— I see her—said he— I see her and he looked round the half empty seats of the members, I thought he was going to say taking her seat successively in every one of the chairs before me, and breathing around her Spirit to be caught by those who shall occupy them through the week— He said it not but he looked it— The auditory was thin and among them were very few members of Congress— The party of gentlemen above named dined with me— I had invited Mr Naylor and he had promised to come; but I received a note from him dated last Night saying that he was called to Philadelphia to his sick child, and must go off this morning. I sent to invite Mr Barnard, but he was engaged— I sent to Mr Truman Smith and he came— This Evening I received a Letter from Mr Henry Stephen Fox the British Minister requesting me to appoint a time to see him to have some conversation with me concerning the case of the Amistad captives, in behalf of whom he is instructed by his Government— And he wishes my advice, in the event of a judgment of the Supreme Court against them.

I advised him to address a Note to the Secretary of State concerning it immediately— He said he would prepare one, and call on me again to-morrow evening, and show it to me.

Jones Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means was not in the house— Atherton moved to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union.

He came in, while I was in the library room. I told him in confidence of my interview with Mr Fox last evening, and I asked him to look into authorities for the doctrine of continuity of voyages in cases of insurance which I thought would apply to the case of the Amistad as a Slave-trader.

Mr William Ratcliff of New-York the projector of the Canal across the Isthmus of Panama was here, to make his annual enquiry what I thought of the prospects of his plan, under the approaching change of the administration— I told him I could not say.— I had given him time after time my opinion that nothing favourable to his design was to be expected from the present administration. I could give him little encouragement now— I had no better expectation of a Spirit of National improvement in the next than has been manifested by the present expiring administration.— He is very much afraid that the English will get possession of the Isthmus, and then command the trade of the world— At the house before going into Committee of the whole, Carr of Indiana, moved to take the morning hour to call the States for Petitions, which was carried.— The Speaker began with Maine, New-Hampshire, Massachusetts. About a dozen petitions were presented before it came to my turn— I had upwards of thirty to present.— I presented only five three of which were referred to appropriate Committees. The other two contained each three several prayers 1. The abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade in the District of Columbia 2. The prohibition of the Slave-trade between the States 3. To refuse the admission of any new State whose Constitution tolerates Slavery. I moved the reference of each of them to the Committee on the Territories. The Speaker said that only the prayer of a refusal to admit new Slaves States could be received—whereupon Connor of North Carolina moved that this part of each of the petitions should be laid on the table, which was done— But upon my remarking that the petitions must be cut in two, Black of Georgia and Wise of Virginia took fire and blazed into a conflagration with me, with each other and with the Speaker— The votes of laying on the table the receivable parts of the petitions were reconsidered by yeas and naysto. Black appealed from the Speaker’s decision. Wise insisted that the petitions had not been received— I braved them both— The house got into a snarl The Speaker knew not what to do—the morning hour expired and Lewis Williams called the orders of the day— Black fumed and raved and moved to suspend the rules to take the question on his appeal, but they would not give him the yeas and nays, and refused to suspend the rules Went into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, Casey in the Chair on the Treasury Note Bill— Waddy Thompson made a frothy, trashy, silly Speech, and Rhett made part of one alike senseless against him— The Committee rose and the house adjourned— Leavitt an evening visitor.

Calhoun about the Tariff. At the house, Black was in a stew to get up his appeal from the decision of the Speaker about abolition petitions— He moved a suspension of the rules to take up his appeal for the morning hour.

Everett offered a call upon the Secretary of the Treasury for a list of Articles dutied under 20 percent but objection was made and the house adjourned— Curtis obtained for me from the Department of State, N.

I went into the House, and while Thompson of Mississippi was discoursing about Tariff and compromise and Treasury Notes, I wrote a motion for a certiorari to the Clerk of the U.S. Circuit and District Courts in Connecticut, to amend the record, by furnishing copies of the proceedings of the District judge, Andrew Judson on board the Amistad upon her being first brought into New London; of all the warrants of seizure, with the Marshals returns thereon the Monitions and returns thereon—and the writ of Habeas Corpus, with the decision of the Circuit Court upon it.

Taney directed me to file the motion, and said the Court would take it into consideration— Returning again to the House, I found Henry S. Lane, a new member from Indiana, hacking and flashing against the administration in answer to Thompson of Mississippi—when he closed, Doctor Duncan of Ohio took the floor, and the Committee rose— Horace Everett attempted to get up his call upon the Secretary of the Treasury but Wise flounced and flouted against it and a motion to adjourn—rejected by yeas and nays with less than 100 members in the house was immediately after carried without a count— Mr Folsom of Cambridge brought me a Letter from President Quincy— He is going on a tour to Mobile and New-Orleans. Dr Parker is a Missionary to and from China—and Mr Bacon is a Clergyman of New-Haven— Dr Parker is fresh from China having left Macao, last July.— He thinks that a diplomatic mission from this Country to China, to mediate a Peace between the celestial empire and Great Britain would be very seasonable and useful.

I attended public worship this morning at the presbyterian Church in 4 1/2 Street, of which Mr Rich, a native of Boston is the pastor; where Mr Leonard Bacon, from New-Haven, preached, from John 4.41. “And many more believed because of his own word; 42. And said unto the woman, Now we believe not because of thy saying; for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.” Mr Bacon is a Trinitarian Calvinist, but his discourse was written and its subject was the interview between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at Jacob’s Well, in the city of Sychar. To this woman according to our English Bible he expressly affirmed that he was the Messiah— In the Greek Testament he simply says “I am”—the he is added in our translation— The question, why he so expressly revealed himself to this degraded woman of Samaria, with whom his disciples marvelled that he should talk at-all, might furnish a subject for an interesting historical Discourse— Mr Bacon considered it from another point of view— His manner is grave, emphatic, but temperate—his elocution distinct and audible—his delivery good but rather stiff. The house was not full— Thomas H. Benton was there. Mrs Webster and Mrs Curtis without their husbands, and several members of Congress— Miss Cutts dined with us, and went with Mary, her daughter Mary-Louisa and me, to the same Church in the afternoon, and heard Dr Parker, from Acts. 14.26 “And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended in the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. 27. And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.”— Dr Parker was ordained as a missionary to China in 1834— And as one of the injunctions of Christ to his Apostles was to heal the sick, that was also one of the duties with which he was charged— In 1835. a hospital was erected by the munificence of the Americans and English at the factories at Canton; and in the short space of 5 years 8000 persons have been admitted to the administration of its benefits— He gave a very brief summary of the origin and present state of the quarrel between Great-Britain and China—and related the Scenes of the strangling of an opium smuggler in front of the factory, and of the riot and mob at the factories on the occasion of an attempt to strangle another there— His narrative was on the whole not encouraging.— This church was crowded almost to suffocation, and it was with the utmost difficulty that we obtained Seats— Mr Fendall paid me an evening visit— He is a candidate for the Office of District Attorney; or that of Solicitor of the Treasury— Doctor and Mrs Thomas spent part of the Evening here with Miss De Butts of Baltimore— Evening lost— "

Monday  Mary rode with me this morning to the Capitol I went before 11. and after half an hour of casual conversation with sundry members of the house, I went into the Supreme Court which had been opened, and where Walter Jones, was about to commence an argument in a case, in which General Gaines, and his wife a daughter of Daniel Clarke, once eminent as a delegate from the territory of Orleans, but long since deceased were the parties on one side— The General and Mrs Gaines were there and he introduced me to her— The Court directed the certiorari to issue to the Clerk of the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut, for which I had moved on Saturday.— My motion had been that the certiorari should go to the Clerk of the District and Circuit Courts— The Attorney General Gilpin did not object to the issuing of the writ, but insisted that it must be directed only to the Clerk of the Circuit Court— The same man is the Clerk of both Courts, and I said that what I wanted was the papers, and was perfectly willing to accommodate the Attorney General as to the form of the order.— I had moved the direction of the writ to the Clerk of both Courts only as a designation of the person, and the proceedings of the two Courts in the case were so blended together that I had no small difficulty in discriminating the papers which emanated from one of the Courts from those which belonged to the other— A difficulty in the perception of which I had not been alone— The anticipated warrant of the President of the United States to Lieutenant Paine, commander of the Grampus, to receive and convey the negroes to Cuba, of 7. Jany 1840. stated them to be in the custody of the Marshal under process pending before the circuit Court— It could not have stood the test of a habeas Corpus So the order was sent by the District Attorney to the Department of State for correction by striking out Circuit and inserting District Court—and was accordingly so corrected—by whom does not appear. Judge Thompson said that the proceedings in the District Court had been revered by the Circuit Court and the record of them all must be there— The writ must therefore be directed to the Clerk of that Court; my motion was accordingly amended by striking out the words District and—and the writ was ordered— I wrote to Mr Baldwin requesting him to see that the return to the writ be made as speedily as possible— In the house, Dr Alexander Duncan held the floor three hours, in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Casey in the Chair, raving about General Harrison’s gallantry and Martin van Buren’s patriotism and Banks and British gold preliminary to a Speech upon other matters and things except the Treasury Note Bill, the subject before the Committee— Evening call from Elisha Dunham of Lee, Berkshire Massts an old acquaintance of Coll.

Section, when it being noon, the Committee adjourned to Thursday Morning— In the house, Tillinghast reported from the Committee of manufactures the bill for laying an impost duty of 20 per cent ad valorem, on pins which was twice read and referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— In that Committee, Casey in the Chair, Dr Duncan resumed his rhapsody; repeating his furious brainless and heartless speeches of the last Session for about two hours and a half. I sickened at hearing him, and went into the supreme Court library-room to look up the reports of the case of Nash or Robbins, delivered up to the British at Charleston S.C. in 1799. under the Treaty of 1794. and found them in Hall’s American Law Journal 7. 13. and Bee’s Admiralty Reports 266: I read them in part and took them out for further examination—with the 12th. Volume of Wheaton’s Reports for the third decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Antelope— On returning to the house I found Garret Davis of Kentucky speaking in reply to Dr Duncan; between whom and W. Cost Johnson there had been an interchange of epithets as Liar, Scoundrel and Coward. Luther C Peck a Member from the western part of New-York called me out into the lobby and introduced to me two Chiefs of the Seneca tribe of Indians a young man educated at Dartmouth college named Pierce; and an elderly pure Indian speaking no English named two Guns— They gave me, two petitions which they requested me to present— And they wished to have some conversation with me; for which they are to call at my house to-morrow Morning— Adjourned at half past three and walked home— Evening consumed in reviewing the case of the Antelope, which I did not half finish; a desperate, dangerous and I fear useless undertaking.

The two Seneca Indian Chiefs, who were introduced to me yesterday came this morning, according to appointment, to converse with me concerning their grievances, and especially to urge the presentation of their petition that no appropriation may be made to carry into effect the fraudulent Treaty—by which they are to be driven like a herd of swine from their homes to a wilderness west of the Mississippi— I told them I would present their petitions as soon as I could possibly get the ear of the house to receive them— That I had already presented a petition from Andover, Massachusetts, praying in their behalf that no appropriation may be made to carry into execution that swindling Treaty— That petition had already been referred to the Committee of Indian affairs; and I advised them to see Mr Bell, the chairman of that committee; to communicate to him the purport of their petitions, and converse with him concerning them— I promised to speak for them myself to Mr Bell; but he was absent the whole of this day from the house— I was twice in the Supreme Court library room, to get at the whole case of the Antelope, upon which I want to open a Steam-battery, upon the argument in the case of the Amistad captives—but Oh! how impotent is my voice to fulfil the purpose of my heart!— I want and cannot yet find the 11th. Volume of Wheaton— I went also into the Supreme Court, and asked Mr Carroll the Clerk for a printed copy of the record in the case of Edward Prigg Plaintiff in Error, vs the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania—in Error to the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania— This is another Slavery question case. Mr Carroll gave me a copy of the record, and asked if he should enter my name as Counsel in the case— I said no— I had nothing to do with it— He said nothing; but looked as if he would say that I had then no right to ask for a copy of the record— I must therefore pay him for it, or return it to him— In the house, Mr Pope made a Speech of about two hours on the Treasury note Bill, as usual avowing that he did not know whether he should vote for it, or not— After him, Mr Wise took the floor; but yielded it to Dr Duncan for personal explanation between Dr Duncan and W. Cost Johnson, and it consisted of a mutual assurance of each of them to the other that he was a liar a scoundrel, a puppy and a coward—upon which Wise almost wrung his hands in lamentation over the anti-dueling law— He then launched out, into a panegyric upon himself a profession of friendliness to the approaching administration towards which he has been justly suspected— He spoke till near 4. and then yielded to a motion to rise, and the house adjourned— I went into the Senate chamber to see Mr Webster, but they had just adjourned, and he was not there.— I employed the whole evening in reviewing the case of the Antelope without getting one third through it "

They had Hoyt by a statement of their intention to enter for exportation a much larger amount than they did enter into a hasty report that they had entered the larger amount— Benton took advantage of the report, to press in the Senate the reduction of the drawback, and the Woolsey’s now, make Hoyt responsible for the misstatements of Tom Benton.— We took up and went through the printed amendments proposed by the Committee of New-York importing merchants, adopted some of them and rejected others.— We set aside all the proposed amendments of Mr George Dwight, because he came here to accuse the Collector Hoyt of corrupt compositions with fraudulent importers; and when required to reduce his charges to writing promised to do so and went away without fulfilling that promise— The Committee then adjourned over to next Tuesday— In the house, Wise resumed the floor—but yielded it to Duncan for a personal explanation—and then came the third interchange of the epithets of liar, scoundrel and coward, between Duncan, and Johnson—upon which Wise lamented the bitter fruits of the dueling Law. and that there would be no fight— He then continued his discourse, and I left the Hall to go in to the Senator Mr Isaac C. Bates, the new Senator from Massachusetts and Mr Webster the other. I spoke to him about Governor Davis’s message to the Massachusetts Legislature concerning the Northeastern boundary— He thought resolutions firm as to the right, and complaining of delay would be appropriate; but said he would see me again— I then went into the Supreme Court and enquired of R. Peters for the 11th. Volume of Wheaton’s Reports which he found and sent me. I went also into the Clerk’s room, and hunted up the records of the proceedings of the Circuit Court of Georgia in the case of the Antelope, and found among them very important papers, for the argument in behalf of the Amistad captives— Returning to the House, I found Wise still speaking; but he soon complained of being exhausted and the Committee rose and the house adjourned, close upon four— I dined with Baron Mareschal the Austrian Minister and a miscellaneous company of 25. among them the two Mexican Commissioners, who were introduced to me— Mr Fox, and Bodisco were also there— I enquired of Mr Fox, if he had sent in to the Department of State, his note concerning the captives of the Amistad— He said he had, but had received no answer. Jenifer was over familiar with Bodisco— Home between 9 and 10— "

An effort was made in the house this morning to suspend the special order of the day, and take up the consideration of public business— Dawson and Russell pressed it upon the house, but in vain. Calvary Morris moved a suspension of the rules to take up a bill proposed by him for the mere immediate repeal of the subtreasury Law— He called for the yeas and nays on his motion, which were 79 to 87. I was except Jenifer the only oppositionist who voted against the suspension, because the simple repeal, without making further provision for the keeping and disbursement of the public monies would plunge the Treasury into tenfold confusion; and there is not time or means to provide a substitute at the present Session— Edmund Burke of New-Hampshire a libel upon his own name moved to resuscitate a dead Committee of the last Session of which he was Chairman; to investigate the dirty contracts of the Clerk about Stationary— Edmund moved to suspend the rules, but the house would not gratify him— They were alike inexorable to Pickens, who with upstretched arm held a fluttering scrap of paper being a Call upon the President for information concerning the seizure of American vessels by British Cruizers on the Coast of Africa. James Garland came to me with a Resolution; which he requested me to offer, to grant the use of the Hall for an hour and a half before the meeting of the House next Monday morning to an exhibition of deaf and dumb and blind pupils— I offered the Resolution, and it was adopted without opposition— Wise held the floor for three hours, in concluding his Speech a motley compound of Eloquence and folly, of braggart impudence and childish vanity—of self-laudation and Virginian narrow-mindedness—Wise is the personified caricature of Virginia— Great conception—wild but energetic elocution— Bathos of conclusion— Small and pitiful result. He was followed by Hubbard of Alabama; who began grunting against the tariff for about half an hour, and then gave way to a motion to rise— The Committee had already once risen, reported no Quorum, and after a refusal to adjourn the house had gone into Committee again— They now rose again and reported no Quorum, and adjourned by yeas and nays 51 to 22— In the course of the morning, Mr Webster came in, had me called from my Seat, and sat down with me five minutes on a Sofa— He said that a member of the Senate of Massachusetts had written to him concerning the North-eastern boundary question— He had informed himself of the present condition of the Negotiation—and he had answered the Massachusetts Senator that the Resolutions should be firm as to the maintenance of the right, and complain much of delays.— In the Evening I received a Letter, from Charles, opening a Scene in the Legislature of Massachusetts, responsive to the course of Mr Webster here.— The boundary question is transferred in Massachusetts to a select joint Committee.

An inflammation in my left eye, threatens me with complete disability to perform my final duty before the Supreme Court in the case of the Amistad captives, while the daily and hourly increasing weight of the pressure of preparation, aggravates that disability— At the first meeting of the house, Pickens reproduced his call upon the President for information respecting the seizure of American vessels by British Cruizers on the Coast of Africa; and it was received without objection. I had prepared this morning and now moved an amendment calling for the correspondence with the British Government relating to the African Slave-trade; and for all N. P. Trist’s despatches as Consul at the Havana, to the Department of State relating to the same subject— I have been ever since the commencement of the last Session anxiously waiting for an opportunity to move this call but have abstained from offering it, from a certainty that if I did it would be objected to, and rejected— Pickens now accepted my amendment— Weller of Ohio who sees deeper into a millstone than Pickens started up and said—“I object to that”— It was too late for Pickens to retract— He repeated that he had no objection to my amendment— Weller roared out again I object, but the Speaker heeded him not—he put the question upon the Resolution as amended and it passed, so that if Weller himself said no, I did not hear his voice— Pickens then, seemingly alarmed at Weller’s objection came to my seat, and said that the only objection that he had to my amendment was that the papers called for by it are so voluminous that he feared it would delay the report upon the call till it would be too late for action upon the papers that he wanted. Foreseeing a motion for reconsideration I said he might easily call at the Department of State, and get a report in part, furnishing the papers of his call, and leaving time for the preparation of the remainder— He seemed satisfied with this, but the danger of a reconsideration was still so great that I went to French the sub-clerk, and asked him to despatch the Call to the President immediately, which he promised to do.— We shall certainly not get Trist’s despatches—perhaps not the diplomatic correspondence particularly Fox’s last note about the Amistad captives—but a refusal or an apology for withholding them will be useful for the appeal to the People, to the world, and to posterity— Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, Casey in the Chair upon the Treasury Note-bill— Hubbard of Alabama finished his grunt, and Jenifer followed him chirping like a cock-robin— Vanderpoel took the floor and the Committee rose, and the house adjourned for want of a Quorum— Yeas and naystoI went into the Senate chamber, and asked Mr Webster if he had received a Letter from my Son— He said he had, and had answered it this morning.— I went to the Clerk’s Office of the Supreme Court— Read the second record from the Circuit Court of Georgia, and asked a Copy of the Court’s opinion upon the Supreme Court’s judgment on the first.

Heard Dr Parker the Missionary to China this morning in the Hall of the House of Representatives, instead of Mr Cookman, who was present—prayed, and gave out, and sung the hymn Dr Parker gave out as preliminary to his discourse five or six texts, the first of which was Joshua 13.1.—“and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.”—and the last was Isaiah 49.12. [“]Behold, these shall come from far; and lo, these from the North and from the west: and these from the land of Sinim.” Of the intermediate texts one was from Deuteronomy, one from Acts, and one, Mark 16.15 “And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” The discourse itself consisted of desultory and miscellaneous observations concerning the religions, manners, customs, habits domestic opinions, principles, prejudices and moral doctrines of the Chinese— He rates the population of the Empire at 360 Millions, which must be greatly over-rated— Of these the great mass have no faith in a state of future existence— Confucius upon an enquiry made to him upon this subject answered only by extinguishing a taper— Yet they have many religious ceremonies, festivals, sacrifices; household idols—but no sabbath— The boodhists believe in the transmigration of souls, and use no animal food for fear of eating their grandfathers— Their system of social intercourse is ceremonious, punctilious, and full of reciprocal courtesy.— The obstacles to the propagation of the gospel among them are insuperable to all worldly wisdom or eloquence; for the first question a missionary meets from a Chinese is how he can expect him to believe a religion, whose God, was crucified as a malefactor— Yet should not the preacher of the Christian gospel despair— The Empire of China, is about to be opened to the social intercourse with the world, and God, in his own time will provide the means of rallying that great people to the Christian fold— Dr Parker gave notice that he should repeat the substance of this discourse, this afternoon at Mr Rich’s Church. The Hall was crowded as full as it could hold— My wife and Mary-Louisa went with me, and we met there Mr and Mrs T. H. Benton, with their little daughter. Mr Benton was courteous, beyond honest courtesy.— My wife with Mary-Louisa rode home. I walked and stop’d on my way to visit Robert C. Winthrop, who has been about ten days confined to his chamber, threatened with a bilious fever, but convalescent— I had much political conversation with him— Miss Cutts dined with us— After dinner, at St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley read Evening prayer for the fourth Sunday after Epiphany, and preached from Isaiah 57.21. “There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.[”] "

Monday  The inflammation of my eye at once disables me for reading or writing, and disorders the arrangement of my time and occupations— Still I write and read as much as nature will bear— Last evening the shooting pain in the eye was so threatening, that I suspended writing on the review of the case of the Antelope, and my wife read to me, three despatches from N. P. Trist, Consul of the United States at Havana, dated from September to December 1839 all in defence of himself against numerous charges of participating in or conniving at the African Slave-trade, so notoriously and so scandalously carried on from the Havana— The call upon the President for these papers is now beyond the reach of reconsideration— The President will not send them for if they shall ever be made public they will blast the reputation of this administration more than that of Trist— I went this morning to the Capitol, before 11. and witnessed the exhibition of the deaf and dumb; and blind, from a School in Virginia— The latter constitute a tolerable band of instrumental music, and performed passably well several popular airs and marches— The performances of the deaf mutes were as I have seen them elsewhere— I went into the Supreme Court and saw Richard K. Randolph of Rhode-Island, and James H. Birch of Missouri, admitted and sworn as Attorneys and Counsellors of the Court— Met Sergeant and Bell there— Mr Sherwood of New-York commenced an argument on the New Jersey Oyster case— I went into the Clerk’s Office; took the Copy of a decree of the Circuit Court of Georgia concerning the costs in the case of the Antelope negroes; and called on the Clerk for the first record of the case itself— Then returned to the house— Hines Holt was sworn as a member from Georgia, in the place of Colquitt, resigned— The Speaker presented an account from Sherrod Williams of Kentucky who has been sick at his lodgings this whole Session, and now claims allowances for short mileage at previous Session of Congress— The Speaker did not like to take upon himself the responsibility of allowing it, and submitted it to the house. After some petty discussion it was laid on the table— Fillmore asked J. W. Jones to allow a short time to receive reports from Committees, but he declined— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Casey in the Chair, Vanderpoel made a speech of four hours; bein a stout and plausible defence of the Administration—when he finished I went to his seat, shook hands with him, and thanked him for his last words and dying speech, and told him it was the best speech he ever made— Fillmore made another attempt to get the Committee discharged from the Note Bill, and failed again— My wife read Trist’s despatches to me the whole Evening till near Midnight.

White of Louisiana, appeared and took his Seat— Curtis Chairman of the Committee of Commerce, came and told me that he had received a note from Mr Forsyth asking the return of Consul Trist’s despatches called for by the Resolution of the House— They are voluminous and verbose, beyond endurance; and yet I regret being obliged to return them not more than half read— The committee to report a mode of examining and counting the presidential electoral votes are on the part of the Senate Preston, Hubbard and Huntington,—on the part of the House, Cushing, John W. Jones, Granger, Dawson and Atherton— Sergeant asked leave to present Resolutions of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, instructing their Senators and requesting their Representatives to vote against a giving away of the public Lands, and in favour of distributing the proceeds to the several States. Fornance moved their reference to the Committee of Ways and Means with Instructions to enquire into the expediency of revising the tariff— Governor Lincoln, while this was going on squeezed in a Resolution to suspend some extra printing or colouring of maps, and Fillmore carried a suspension of the Rules for a Resolution to discharge the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, from the further consideration of the Treasury Note Bill to-morrow at 3. O’Clock P.M— With only two or three other oppositionists voted against this suspension and resolution; and I told Fillmore he was playing the game into the hands of the Philistines However he carried his resolution— Sergeant then reproduced his Resolution of the Legislature of Pennsylvania— Jones resisted— Sergeant moved a suspension of the Rules— Jones then withdrew his objection. The Resolutions of the Legislature were received, laid on the table and ordered to be printed— The house then went into Committee of the whole, Casey in the Chair, and Triplett of Kentucky and Coles of Virginia, each for about an hour gave the pro and the con of countervailing duties to protect the tobacco trade— Then Black of Georgia for an hour and a half poured forth his Black Bile chiefly upon his colleagues from Georgia, who have been re-elected.—he having been defeated— Alford of Georgia then took the floor but the Committee rose for want of a Quorum— Alford moved to go into Committee again— I called on the Speaker to Count the House— He counted and said there were less than 70 members present.

I took back to the Department of State this morningdespatches from N. P. Trist Consul of the United States, at the Havana, which are included in my call upon the President by amendment of that of Pickens last Saturday— I enquired if there had been any investigation of the charges against Trist, by the shipmasters and mariners, as was recommended by the report of the Committee of Commerce of the House of Representatives at the close of the former Session of this Congress, N. 707. 21. July 1840— Secretary Forsyth was not at the Office, his chief Clerk Martin told me that there had been no executive investigation of Mr Trist’s conduct since the last Session— That Mr Alexander H. Everett had made a confidential report after a special mission to Havana upon all the complaints against Mr Trist in whose hands the report now was, for explanations and commentaries. And there was a voluminous Spanish judicial record the translation of which was in the hands of Mr Dimitry, and still to be reported. I found the house in Session, and Wise, having prevailed on someone to move a reconsideration, of the Resolution adopted yesterday to discharge the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, from the further consideration of the Treasury Note Bill at 3. O’Clock this day— He, Wise had an amendment to propose, that the same power conceded to this Administration in the Bill, should be extended to the next—to issue an amount of five Millions of dollars to the end of the year, and that then the debate should cease, the questions on the amendments should be taken, and the Bill reported to the house— Cushing rose and inquired, what? without debate? whereupon Wise turned upon him like a Tyger, and in the most peremptory terms insisted yes without for the resolution to be reconsidered had itself arrested all debate— I voted for the reconsideration as I had voted against the suspension, and now the whigs voted for the reconsideration and it was carried— Wise then offered his amendment, but Fillmore withdrew his Resolution— Morgan moved to go in to Committee of the whole on the Union. Wise then proposed to appeal from the Speaker’s decision, that Fillmore could withdraw his, Resolution, but the Speaker told him he was too late.— He put the question of going into Committee of the whole, and called Casey to the Chair— Weller of Ohio, Brackenridge of Pittsburg, James Monroe, and lastly Alford of Georgia for an hour and a half descanted upon all the topics which have been tacked upon this bill— Alford let out all his Georgian Bile against the Northern Manufacturers, and the Northern interests— I think I shall stand it no longer— Charles Shepard of North-Carolina, took the floor—the Committee rose and the house adjourned at half past 4— The whole Evening was employed in retrieving Diary arrears of the last two days— "

Just as I was going out this morning, Mr Hodgson brought me two Newspapers in the Spanish language the Noticioso de Ambos Mundos. published at New-York—of the 9th. and 23d. of January— They contain two Articles on the case of the Amistad, and one concerning a refusal to receive Mr Turnbull as British Consul at the Havana, because he is an abolitionist. I called at the War Department, to remind the Secretary of the recommendation I left there last year of William H Wood, Son of Henry Wood of Quincy for an appointment of Cadet at West-Point, from next June, when Zealous B. Tower of Cohasset is to be graduated— He was recommended by me, and has been at the head of his class throughout his whole career.— Mr Poinsett was gone out to the Arsenal to see some exhibition of Ordnance; but the chief clerk told me, he would look up the recommendation, and this Evening I received the Commission of Cadet W. H. Wood— Reaching the Capitol half an hour before the Meeting of the house, I went into the Clerk’s office of the Supreme Court, and examined a small part of the first Record of the Circuit Court in Georgia of the case of the Antelope— The claim of the Spanish Vice-Consul at Savannah Mulvey filed 1. August 1820. was for 166 of the Slaves. that of the Portuguese Vice-consul Sorrel was for 130— On my return to House, I found Charles Shepard on the floor, discussing the topics of the Treasury Note Bill, as a Southern planter for an hour; followed by James Garland of the same interest— I then took my turn for an hour, and arraigned before the Committee, the Nation and the World, the principles avowed by Henry A Wise and his three coloured standard of Overseer black, duelling blood red, and dirty cadaverous nullification white— Of its effect I will not now speak— I have discharged what I believe to be a solemn and sacred duty.— At the close of his reply his gang of duelists clap’d their hands and the gallery hissed. William Cost Johnson began his usual rhodomontade, but the whole committee was in fermentation; they rose and the house adjourned at half 4— My wife dined with her brother Thomas B. Johnson whose health is very bad. The episode of this day has so completely absorbed all my feelings that my usual occupations were suspended. "

V: Friday  Sleepless Night— The step that I have taken, yesterday absorbs all the faculties of my Soul— Deliberately taken, to have any useful effect, it must be calmly, firmly, judiciously, perseveringly, alas! skifully, pursued— I fear I have estimated too highly its importance— I fear my own incompetency to sustain it effectively and successfully— I know not what support I shall receive in or out of the house— I stand alone in this undertaking. Few if any of my colleagues appear to understand my purpose and from their deportment yesterday, I should conclude they thought it one of my eccentric, wild, extravagant, freaks of passion— Trumbull of Connecticut alone came to me after it was over—took me by the hand, and thanked me— Mr Barnard thought I ought to have dwelt more emphatically upon the disclaimer of all motive personally offensive to Wise, though he admitted I had disclaimed them. Brockway this day asked if my speech would be printed, and ascertained that Wheeler had taken full and accurate notes of it— Mr Merrick Senator from Maryland and David Hoffman of Baltimore visited here this day, and told my wife that Mr Webster had been highly delighted at hearing of my speech—but all around me is cold, and discouraging, and my own feelings are wound up to a pitch that my reason can scarcely endure— I trust in God to control me. Mr Gallaudet and Mr M’Lellan were here this morning, to ask my influence to carry through a Bill granting some city lots to the Howard Society, a charitable corporation in this City; which I promised so far as I should have power to exercise it— I called at the Department of State with a paper belonging to Trist’s despatches which had slipped under other papers— Mr Curtis had received yesterday a note from the Secretary of State informing him that this paper was missing, and I found it on my table last Evening— At the house, Governor Lincoln, by a suspension of the rules offered and carried a Resolution that the debate on the Treasury Note Bill should cease at 7 O’Clock this Evening, he at first proposed 5. but modified it at the request of some gentlemen pregnant with eloquence to 7. The house then went into Committee of the whole, Casey in the Chair— W. Cost Johnson began with a short feeble interrupted Speech, followed by some chaffering in which Cushing and Lincoln were at issue, and there by a three hours whig speech from Rayner of North-Carolina—next by two hours of vulgar, coarse and silly buffoonery from Reynolds— Steenrod next got the floor, but yielded it to Mallory the re-instated member from Norfolk Virginia, who swallowed whole the system promulgated in Wise’s Speech, and endorsed every word and syllable in it— Then Underwood, who told of the Speech which he would have made, but that he had not time— The debate finished by a sneer at the little end of the big whig party—in the difference between Cushing and Lincoln. Barnard’s amendment was rejected, Wise’s adopted—the Bill was reported, passed to the third reading and passed,—and the house adjourned at 8. O’Clock— I left the hall to walk home and saw a small glimpse of the moon otherwise totally eclipsed—met the Carriage and rode home. "

Saturday—  I attended at the Hall of the house, half an hour before Noon, the stated time of the house’s meeting, and went into the Office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court, and read several pages more of the Record of the Antelope case in the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Georgia— Returning to the house, they had no sooner commenced upon business than I was called out of my seat to see a Mr Bacon of New-Haven a brother of the Clergyman who was here with Dr Parker, and who has lived sometime on the Coast of Africa— I had some conversation with him, respecting the manner in which this Slave trade is carried on in the interior of Africa itself. He says that they are divided into small tribes, each with chiefs wh are called by Europeans, kings— That they are constantly at War with each other for the express purpose of making Slaves for sale. That the Europeans at the factories on the Coast advance money or goods to them with a credit of three, four or six months, in which time they are to procure and bring down for delivery at the factory a given number of Slaves, and when they deliver them they recieve another credit in advance— That great numbers of the Slaves by nightly expeditions were taken and their villages were burnt— That considerable numbers were sold by judicial sentences for crimes, particularly for adultery: an offence for which they are particularly sensitive— He says he asked Sinqua who sold him, and he answered the son of his king; whom he Bacon well knew, an one of the most active African traders.— While talking with Mr Bacon I lost my name on a call of yeas and nays in the house— It was a day for the consideration of private business, and the rule of the house is that Bills shall be taken up, in Committee of the whole against which there is no objection To the first bill brought up in Committee objection was made; and from that time the member who had charge of the claim on which that bill was founded made objection to every bill that was brought up— Nothing—absolutely nothing was done. The Committee rose two or three times, and the house by yeas and nays two or three times refused to adjourn. At Wise’s motion they rescinded the rule—took up a bill; debated it half an hour rejected it by yeas and nays, received a motion for reconsideration and just after 4. adjourned— I dined with Mr Poinsett the Secretary of War—Mrs Poinsett, Coll. Totten.— Gouverneur Kemble, Mr Markoe of the State Department, and three Engineer Officers formed the party— Mrs Poinsett was very pleasant and amiable— After dinner I had a free and candid conversation with Mr Poinsett whose ministerial career is about to close— The Bank of the United States with all the Philadelphia and Baltimore Banks have again suspended payments.

It was Mr Braxton’s day, and that and the weather had so thin’d the hall, that it was piteous to look round on the empty chairs.— It looked like the House without a Quorum on weekdays about the hour of dinner.— Mr Braxton entered upon the enclosure of the Speaker’s chair, with an old Scotchman, who preached in his stead from Acts 13.12. “Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished, at the doctrine of the Lord.”— This chapter contains the narrative of the first going forth of Paul and Barnabas to preach the gospel to the Gentiles; and of the sorcerer Elymas struck blind at Paphos in the Island of Cyprus.— A copious subject, but of which the old Scotch divine made not much profitable instruction— The principal merit of his discourse was its brevity— The broad Scottish brogue of his pronunciation was unpleasant—his personal appearance was not favourably prepossessing, and very commonplace Christian morality, formed the texture of the Sermon— Mr Braxton read the hymn; but there was no one to sing, and the whole service barely occupied an hour.— After dinner I attended at Dr Laurie’s Church, expecting to hear Mr Van Rensselaer a Son of the Old Patroon, who is now partly settled in that Church: but there too I found a stranger who preached from James 1.13. “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 14— But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed 15. Then, when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” Whatever may be the character of the Sermon, there never fails to be wisdom and virtue in the text— There was nothing to be remembered in this preacher’s treatment of his text, but there was an inexhaustible fund for meditation and improvement in the text itself. He gave notice that the communion would be administered this day two weeks, and that the Revd. Mr Van Rensselaer had been prevented from officiating in the service of this day by serious indisposition— Throughout this day as through many that have immediately preceded it my mind has been in a state of fearful agitation, and my health and spirits suffer with it— Neither of the preachers of this day had power to call me from the world to God.— Cookman’s admonition to bridle my tongue ought to have its practical influence on my conduct— I pray that it may have—but I must speak. This day my thoughts have been scattered; and I have been looking into Shakespear for Coriolanus and the Volsces, and for the plucking of the red and white roses in the temple Garden, in the days of the Plantagenets— I had no time to waste on the arrival last Evening at Baltimore last Evening, of William Henry Harrison, President elect of the United States, nor on the cotemporaneous suspension of specie payments, by the Banks of Philadelphia, and Baltimore.

Monday  Mr Blake came with a bill for book binding which I settled; and he told me that a file of papers of the National Intelligencer, of mine left at his Office to be bound, had been burnt; together with a large amount of his own property. I went to the house at 11. Theodore Talbot rode with me. I went into the Office of the Clerk’s Office of the Supreme Court, and waded neck deep into the Record of the Circuit Court in Georgia, of the case of the Antelope—but could not reach the first decree of the Court— In the house this was the day for the reception of Petitions—The only one for several weeks past— The only one for the remainder of the Session— John W. Jones Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the Pension appropriation Bill— Waddy Thompson, chairman of the Military Committee had Letters from the Secretary of War, and from General Armistead asking an appropriation of 100000 dollars to buy a surrender of the remaining Indians in Florida—and wanted to go into Committee of the whole upon the Union for that— Jones told him that he might move it as an amendment to his pension bill— I supplicated for this day, for the reception of petitions: of which I said I had in my draw, ten of which might possibly be received.— I spoke in vain. I called for the yeas and nays which were 92 and 92. and the Speaker decided to go into Committee of the whole, and called Clifford of Maine to the Chair— The Pension Appropriation Bill was read— Waddy Thompson then moved his appropriation-bill to buy an Indian surrender— Petrikin objected to it as not in order, as it certainly was not, by the 50th. rule— Clifford was muddily bothering his trickster invention to get over this rule, when Briggs suggested to him the last patch upon the 76th. rule; he snap’d at it like a mackerel at a red rag, and said the amendment was in order— Waddy Thompson made a frothy speech upon the amendment and when he had done, I objected that the amendment was not in order—he said it was too late; and the debate proceeded.— Giddings of Ohio in a speech of three hours, opposed the amendment, assuming to prove that the Florida War originated and has been conducted throughout, for the support of Southern Slavery.— He laid down too narrow a basis for his superstructure, but he proceeded step by step citing his documentary proof as he went along to the exquisite torture of the Southern duelists and Slave-mongers—Georgians, Carolinians and Virginians.— They interrupted him every five minutes by calls to order, and Clifford who has neither eyes to see nor a heart to feel what is or is not in order, according to his caprice, sometimes sustained and sometimes silenced him. When he finished Mark A. Cooper one of the Apostate and dismounted whigs of Georgia took the floor and argufied without losing his temper till half past 4. when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— I came home and a man calling himself Stephen Hull a Minister of Carlisle Middlesex County Massachusetts came complaining that his valise had been stolen from him and craving supplies. I expected some evidence of his character or of his loss, and he took leave. "

Tuesday—  Snow— I attended at the chamber of the Committee of the Manufactures, but Mr Slade was the only other member of the Committee who attended, and nothing could be done— The President elect, William Henry Harrison arrived with the morning train of Cars, from Baltimore—received by a vast crowd of Citizens, headed by the Mayor of the City, William W. Seaton, who escorted him to the city Hall, and there addressed him with a cordial welcome— He returned this with a suitable answer, and then went and took lodgings at Gadsby’s Hotel. I went to the Office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court, and read further in the Circuit Court Record of the Antelope case— I bespoke a copy of the judge’s decision in the case of the Spanish Vice Consul— In the house there was a special order for the consideration of this day— A bill reported by Underwood about Steamboat explosions— The rules were suspended to postpone till Thursday that Bill, and take up again the Pension appropriation Bill with its tack the extra hundred thousand dollar appropriation to buy the Indian surrender— Mark A Cooper resumed his Cretan labyrinth of argument in answer to Giddings— Cooper whose ideas are generally false conceptions, strained hard to be very severe upon Giddings; but finding he could find no malignant sympathy to cheer him, turned at last upon me— He said there was an opinion among many that I was insane and did not know what I said but it was not so— If I was insane he wished he could be bitten by the same dog. There came a loud cry of order from every quarter of the house— Clifford in loud, rapid and peremptory tone, said the Gentleman from Georgia is out of order. I rose and implored the Chairman and the Committee that they would allow him to proceed— Mark saw he was upon a wrong scent, and turned off upon another— Dawson came to my seat, and supplicated me not to reply to him— The appeal was irresistible— I pledged my word to Dawson that I would not open my lips upon the Bill— Cooper was followed by Black with fourfold malignity and tenfold fury— He raved methodically and read from the Philanthropist and the Bible, till he was time after time called to order by his own party and by the Chairman, whose decisions were twice reversed—once that Black was not in order and once that he was.— Waddy Thompson at last interfered to silence Black by a grossly insulting fling at Giddings. and Black was finally worried down by his own crew. Downing the Delegate from Florida followed, by a more vigorous and plausible, but quite as unjust an assault upon Giddings by controverting his documents I almost repented of my promise to Dawson—for Giddings found no support— The Committee rose and the house rose for want of a Quorum— Agreed to meet here after at 11. A.M. John Connell here this Evening. "

I went at ten this morning to the Capitol, and finding the preparations for the ceremony not completed in the Hall of the Representatives repaired to the Office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court, and read about half an hour in the Record of the Circuit Court in Georgia, the proceedings on the libel of the Portuguese Vice Consul Sorrel, claiming 130 of the captives of the Antelope— A Sub clerk in the office was making out a copy of the decision of the judge on the first claim of Mulvey the Spanish Vice Consul— Mr Carroll the Clerk told me that I was running up a bill against my clients by calling for these copies— I was aware of that, but I believed it absolutely necessary for a full and fair review of the case of the Antelope— Yet I must not overlook the admonition of the Clerk— In the house there was a motion of Andrews of Kentucky to take the pension and Florida War Bill out of Committee of the whole to-morrow at Noon—carried by suspension of the rules. There was some struggling to get in petitions, without success— Carr of Indiana, moved to begin the call with Iowa—which was to cut me off— Giddings rose to complain of an insolent personal reflection upon him made yesterday by Waddy Thompson and reported this morning in the National Intelligencer. There was so much disorder and confusion in the house that I did not fully hear Giddings, nor Thompson in reply nor Alford who affected to believe or actually blundered into the belief that Waddy’s insult yesterday was hurled at him— The flurry was abridged by the hour of Noon when Briggs offered a Resolution to send a Message to the Senate, that the house were ready to proceed to open and count the presidential electoral votes— The Senate immediately after came in— The Vice President Richard M. Johnson took the seat of the Speaker and presided at the Meeting—the Speaker being seated at his left. The Tellers Preston of the Senate, Cushing and John W. Jones of the house sat in the front of the Clerk’s Table— The Vice President broke the Seals of the returns beginning with Maine— Two copies of each, one received by special messenger and one by the mail— The three tellers read alternately by the returns, which were sum total of votes 294. of which 234 for William Henry Harrison of Ohio, and 60 for Martin Van Buren of New-York as President. 234 for John Tyler of Virginia, 48 for Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky 11 for Littleton Waller Tazewell of Virginia, and 1. for James K. Polk of Tennessee as Vice President. The Vice President then proclaimed Harrison and Tyler to have been duly elected President and Vice President of the United States, for 4 years from the 4th. of March next and declared the Meeting dissolved. The Senate withdrew, and the house adjourned. While the votes were counting Mr Chambers of Kentucky informed me that General Harrison had called to visit me at my house— I returned his visit at Gadsby’s— Mr Lambdin here. "

He rode with me to the Capitol, and took it with him— I sat to him nearly an hour in the room of the Committee of Post-Offices and Post-roads, until the meeting of the Committee when we were obliged to retire— I went into the Office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court and read nearly all the remainder of the Record of the Circuit Court in Georgia in the case of Francis Sorrel, Vice Consul of Portugal against 130 african captives of the Antelope— In the house after some petty episodes, the pension appropriation Bill, with its Florida-War tack was taken up— Smith of Indiana who generally deserves the praise of silence, broke it now for a very foolish speech of half an hour; and a more foolish amendment after offering which he did not know whether he had done or not— Briggs answered him somewhat roughly, and at noon the question was taken by yeas and nays, first on the tack, and then on the bill; both of which were reported to the house, passed to the 3d reading and passed— John W. Jones then moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— It was carried, and the Speaker called Bell of Tennessee to the Chair— An item of 25000 dollars, for Stationery for the house of Representatives started a debate which consumed the remainder of the day, till from mere weariness and want of a Quorum, near five O’Clock the Committee rose and the house adjourned— Governor Lincoln moved to reduce the item to 15000 dollars—and the by-play of the two parties was curious; and the exposure of the rotten contracts of the Clerk, Hugh A. Garland with Langtree was so scandalous, that the stomach nauseated with them— A man named Edmund Burke, the very thickest skull of all New-Hampshire, Chairman of a Committee of the last Session to whitewash the Clerk, performed the work in so bungling a manner—that he now moved the reappointment of the same Committee. But Stanly said he had a word to say against that— Bynum favoured striking out the item to weaken the incoming whig administration, and Evans opposed it with a maul upon Lincoln and his economy and a backhanded blow at Underwood who has some pettyfogging project of giving 20 dollars a Session to each member to purchase his Stationery. The Attorney General Gilpin came in to the House and told me that he had received the additional parts of the Record which I had demanded; and if I would come into the Court room to-morrow morning, he would let me have them to examine; as there remains but little time till next Tuesday within which it must be printed— Mr John Connell spent the Evening here—and Richard Smith was here this morning about the Execution of Mrs Hays’ Will.

Elizabeth Pierce and her Sister Mrs Telfair have come again to spend the winter here, in pursuit of their hopeless claim— Miss Pierce brought me to read a Letter from Mr Tristam Burgess to Mrs Telfair about their certificates, but from which I collected very little information— At the house Mr Cushing made report from the joint Committee of the two houses W. C. Preston of the Senate, and Caleb Cushing and Henry A. Wise of the house, appointed to inform William Henry Harrison of Ohio, of his election as President of the United States, that they had performed the service— That he had answered that he accepted gratefully the Office, and would to the best of his ability faithfully perform its duties.— Edmund Burke renewed his motion made yesterday to suspend the rules for a resolution to re-appoint the Committee of last Session to Whitewash Garland the Clerks Stationery contracts with Langtree— The stupidity of the motion, brought up even Dromgoole against it. Yet they do so hang together in their discomfiture, that the vote was 67 to 63 for the reappointment, and failed only by the lack of the two thirds. It was private business day. John W. Jones moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the Union, to take up the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill; but the house refused by yeas and nays 65 to 84. and took up in succession sundry private Bills, among which was one continuing for the benefit of the widows and children of Dr Henry Perrine a grant of a township of land, for the cultivation of tropical plants.— The Bill passed in favour of Dr Perrine when he was here two years ago; since which he has been murdered by the Indians— I had received a Letter soliciting my aid in favour of the Bill and voted for it— Stanly voted for it, and then moved a reconsideration, without assigning any satisfactory reason— He said he was not desirous of pressing his motion for reconsideration, but Dawson called the yeas and nays upon it— The reconsideration was refused 66 to 126.— Numerous Reports from Committees were received. I moved to make the Bill for the suppression of frauds in the collection of the revenue the special order of the day for the 22d. of this month, but a minority of the house again rejected the motion.— The house adjourned near 5. O’Clock. I read nearly through the new parcels of the record received from New-Haven, nine tenths of which are mere repetitions, absolutely useless— I returned them to the Clerks Office, on the notice that there would be no necessity to have them printed— Mr John Connell was here again this Evening.

He asked me to sit again on Monday; which I promised to do, if practicable.— In the house the day which should have been devoted to public business, was consumed in debate upon subjects irregularly introduced— First Clifford of Maine called up a Bill reported by the Committee of foreign Affairs, appropriating 75000 dollars for continuing the Survey by Commissioners of the North-eastern boundary— He got the house after some difficulty into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon this Bill, Linn Banks in the Chair. The Bill had been sent to the Printers.— French acting Clerk, was about reading the original manuscript draught of the Bill— Some pettifogger demanded where was the Bill, and upon being told it was at the Printers objected to proceeding without the Bill— Up started a debate of an hour, upon the question whether a bill could be debated in Committee of the whole or in the house upon a manuscript copy— I never knew this question made before— The universal practice is to debate any sort of a copy manuscript or printed till the 3d. reading when it must be engrossed; no amendments are then admitted, and the question taken is upon the engrossed bill— But now nothing would do but the Committee must have the bill— Dromgoole who is recovering from a long and severe indisposition and has returned to his Seat argued and descanted upon the absolute necessity of having the Bill. Motion after Motion was made to take up other Bills and to rise— The Committee did rise once for lack of a Quorum; but returned into Committee again as soon as the quorum was ascertained; till at last the Bill was brought in from the Printers.— Then another debate was sprung upon the amount of the appropriation 50000— 37500 25000. 20000 were thought enough by some and the morning hour expired before a question could be taken.— Pickens Chairman of the Committee of foreign relations made a report, professedly upon the correspondence relating to the case of M’Leod a Canadian now under indictment for murder in the State of New-York at the burning of the Steamboat Caroline.—but really an inflammatory invective against the British Government— This Report by a bare majority of the Committee was by a close party majority of the house laid on the table, and ordered to be printed. Everett moved an amendment, to print documents relating to the burning of the Caroline which was rejected. I moved to recommit the report; but the Speaker said the motion was not in order. The debate was sharp. I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer, and requested of Mr Seaton to revise the Reporter’s Notes of my Speech— "

I attended public worship this morning in the Hall of the house of Representatives, where Mr Sawtell, who is the Minister of an American Chapel for Seamen at Havre delivered a discourse upon the character, virtues, vices, and wants of Seamen— It was rather a Lecture than a Sermon, but he took for a text Psalm 107.23— [“]They that go down to the Sea in ships, that do business in great waters 24. These see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep 25. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. 26. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble. 27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are their wit’s end. 28. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 29. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still 30. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.” The text is a brief and graphic description of a storm at sea; but the discourse was a dissertation upon the characteristics of sailors as a distinct class of population— Of the causes which most frequently, lead men to follow the sea—upon the circumstances into which it throws them—upon the influences which it brings to bear upon them upon the temptations into which it necessarily throws them; upon the adventurous character of their lives, and upon the great influences which they exercise in human society.— And especially of their need of religious and moral instruction—interspersed with narratives of several affecting instances of conversions of sailors to exemplary piety—and righteousness of life and conversation. He gave also an account of the establishment of the American chapel for Seamen at Havre— Of his own settlement there, and of his own Mission now here to raise a sum of 10000 dollars to build a chapel there— Of which he said he had already obtained in this Country subscriptions to the amount of 8000.— The whole discourse was listened to with great interest by a full but not overflowing auditory.— Returning home I was first startled by the ringing of bells for fire— They soon stop’d and I then met General Harrison returning from church. He said he had received a note from Mrs Adams, inviting him to an evening party on the 22d. instt, but he was going to Virginia— He would however make an exception for my house and would dine with me at any time.— I visited Mr Saltonstall, who is confined to his chamber with an attack of the gout— After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley read the Evening prayer for Sexagesima Sunday, and Mr Van Pent of Philadelphia preached from 2. Corinthians 8.9. [“]For ye know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.” Mr Trumbull and Mr Baldwin here this Evening.

Fahrenheit 20  At 10 this morning I went to the Capitol, and gave a sitting of an hour to Mr Lambdin in the Committee room of the Committee of Post-Offices and Post-roads.— He asked me for another sitting to-morrow if practicable— In the house, Turney of Tennessee obtained a suspension of the rules, to pass a bill about Tennessee Land titles, opposed by Lewis Williams and almost the whole North-Carolina delegation as injurious to the rights of that State— But several of the Tennessee members of both sides went round the house while the votes by yeas and nays were taken, begging their fellow partizans as a special favour, to help them push through the bill, and it was carried by a large majority. Stanly asking to be excused from voting, unwilling to decide between his Tennessee whig friends, and his colleague Williams. The Bill was driven through by the previous question— It was the day for the presentation of Resolutions; and I had one, concerning an unconstitutional act of the Legislature of South-Carolina, ready— But John W. Jones moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill, which was done, Bell of Tennessee in the chair Two small amendments were proposed by Evans and Tillinghast and were adopted— Landaff W. Andrews of Kentucky moved to strike out an appropriation of 1500 dollars for compensation to a Secretary to the President to sign Land patents—whence a debate in which Governor Lincoln as a member of the Committee of public Lands brought to light two facts— 1. That for several years past none of the Land patents have been executed according to Law— And 2. that there are now at the Land Office 60,000 patents unsigned because of a question between the Commissioner and Recorder, which of the two should sign them. I entered with some indignation into this debate; but opposed the striking out of the appropriation.— Andrews finally withdrew his motion to strike out— Vanderpoel moved to strike out a 1000 dollar clerk of the 5th auditor, and after much criminative and recriminative debate—till this motion too was withdrawn— While it was under discussion, I went into the Supreme Court room, where I found Mr Walker a Senator from Mississippi arguing a question, on the Constitutional right of the State of Mississippi, to prohibit the importation of Slaves into the State as Merchandize. He closed an argument of two days—but the case I was told would probably take two or three days more— The case of the Amistad will follow next. I went into the Clerk’s Office, and read the late judge Johnson’s first decision in the Circuit Court for the eighth District (Georgia) in the case of the Antelope— Returning again to the house, I found Wise, defining again his position and sparring with Jenifer and Graves and Pope, and Andrews, till half past six O’Clock, when the Committee rose and the house adjourned.

Volume Thomas Sessford came to take my name down, as an honorary member of the firemen’s insurance company, and to levy upon me therefor an annual fine of five dollars— Mr Waters has returned from his visit to Virginia, and is now a candidate for re-instatement as an appraiser at the port of Boston— Mr Lincoln was here some days since, and came now with a Mr Webster of Boston whom I did not know— At half past ten I attended at the chamber of the committee of manufactures; but was alone, and after entering my name, gave a final sitting of half an hour to Mr Lambdin at the Committee Room of the Committee of Post-Offices and Post-roads.— He returns to Philadelphia to-morrow— M’Kay who was there said the Portrait was an excellent likeness— I found the house under a motion by Fillmore to suspend the rules to admit his Resolution instructing the military committee to report a Bill for putting the Northern and Northeastern frontier in a state of defence— The rules were suspended; and Fillmore by moving the previous question and by modifying the instruction to the Committee to an enquiry into the expediency of reporting a Bill for defensive armament carried his resolution.— The house then as usual by the suspension of the rules went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Bell, in the Chair— The Salary of the Commissioner of public buildings has increased from 2 to 3000 dollars—whence a debate on the gross abuses in regard to the payment of the workmen on the public buildings, and the injustice done them by suspensions of their work. I entered largely into this debate. Ross one of the workmen brought me one of the due-bills issued to him last September for 121.75 because there was no appropriation to pay it. William M. M’Carty moved an Appropriation of 30,000 dollars for repairing and restoring the Potowmac bridge, which after considerable discussion was carried— I saw the coming Secretary of the Treasury, and spoke to him of the re-appointment of Schuyler Sampson Collector at Plymouth; from his remarks I answered Mr Sampson’s Letter and advised him to apply for re-appointment. I left the house and went into the Law Library to look for an Act of the Legislature of South-Carolina, which I was unable to find— Mr Walker of Mississippi was there upon similar and more successful researches—returning to the house I found they had adjourned. Hawes and Cushing came to me to inquire if I would go to China. I answered that if the invitation should be given I would take it into consideration— "

The Attorney General Gilpin is to close in that case to-morrow, and Mr Webster follows in a case involving the same principle, so that the Amistad case will probably not come up till Saturday— I found the house already in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Bell in the Chair, on the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— Lane, Smith and Proffit of Indiana, had been pushing for a suspension of the rules to get up some Indiana land Bill; but failed— Governor Lincoln had succeeded by a suspension of the rules, to introduce a Bill from the Committee on the public Lands to legalize land titles to the amount of millions of acres, held by patents null and void issued from the Land Office— Postponed till to-morrow, and the Bill to be printed— On the general appropriation bill, the motion made by Willis Green of Kentucky was to strike out all the items for the three branch Mints at Charlotte North-Carolina Dahlonega in Georgia, and New-Orleans— Bynum had the floor and in a speech of three hours, ran through his whole Budget of Anti-federal anti-bank, anti-tariff, anti-manufacturing democracy, upon which he has harped about once a month ever since he has been in Congress— Then followed a sharp-shooting debate between sundry North-Carolina, Georgia and Kentucky retrenchers and reformers, the Georgians and North-Carolinians, though among the sturdiest economists in the house, resisting unguis et calcibus the retrenchment of about 75000 dollars a year, of the most useless of all expenditures wasted upon these branch mints— Habersham of Georgia commenced a sparring bout with Tillinghast of Rhode-Island, who feebly defended his state, without that most forcible of all arguments the retort courteous. After much snarling and one or two failures of Quorums the question of striking out was taken by tellers and lost 53 to 73. the Committee rose and about half past 5 the house adjourned.— I walked home, and spent the Evening at writing.

A severe visitation of Province  There was an exhibition at a quarter before 11. in the front yard of the Capitol of firing with Colt’s repeating fire arm, a new invented instrument of destruction for discharging 12 times a musket in as many seconds— I rode to the Capitol with Mr Smith— We had alighted from the Carriage from five to ten minutes when the firing commenced— My carriage was then going out of the yard, the horses took fright, the Carriage was jammed against a Messengers wagon, overset, the pole and a whipple tree broken, the harness nearly demolished— The Coachman Jeremy Leary and the footman John Causten precipitated from the box, and Jerry nearly killed on the spot. He was taken into one of the lower rooms at the Capitol, where as soon as I heard of the disaster I found him in excruciating torture— John Causten a coloured man was taken to the house of his uncle who lives on the capitol hill— I sent for Dr. Sewall, May, Lindsley and Thomas, but the first who came was Dr Kearney a Surgeon in the Navy— Jerry’s first desire was for a Roman Catholic priest who was sent for and came and confessed him and afterwards administered over him the rite of extreme unction. Dr Kearney on the first examination supposed that he had only received a very severe contusion in the back but afterwards found that there was a more alarming internal wound in the bowels— After an hour or more Mr Follansbee furnished one of the Messengers waggons in which a mattrass pillow and blankets were laid, and he was brought home and put to bed. Dr Kearney accompanied the waggon, which I proceeded by walking home. His strength was so prostrated and his pulse so feeble that a large muster plaster was spread over his bowels to stimulate the reaction— Dr Thomas attended him soon after we got home— I walked back to the Capitol, and on my way met Mr Thomas Munroe, who informed me that the house had taken a recess from half past 2 to 4. O’Clock— In the Capitol Western yard I met Mr Baldwin, who informed me that the Mississippi case was closed in the Supreme Court; but that there was another involving the same question, upon which Mr Webster was to speak, and was desirous of doing so with our consent to-morrow, to which we agreed— I went into the Law Library to enquire again after the third volume of the Laws of South-Carolina; but neither of two copies of it was there, nor could the Librarian be certain who had taken them out— I attended the house after the recess—there was a debate on a proviso in the appropriation bill to limit the pay of District attornies Clerks of U.S. Courts and Marshals, followed by a motion of Stanly to strike out the enacting clause— I left the house at 7. in the Evening, Stanly speaking and came home.

There was a slight hope last evening that this poor and most excellent man, might yet survive and recover, but his increasing weakness and great restlessness through the night which Mr Smith, and Mrs Goods passed in attendance upon him gave no encouraging hope and when Dr Thomas came this morning, I saw the inevitable event in his countenance— Yet I did not expect he was so near his end, as it proved— I walked to the Capitol, and attended at the meeting of the house. Mr Stanly’s speech of last Evening which he brought to a close about 9 O’Clock, lashed all the nullification of South-Carolina, into fury— As soon as the house met this morning Mr Holmes of Charleston asked leave to say something— Stanly immediately objected unless he should be permitted to reply— He added that the Gentleman might answer him to his heart’s content when the house should be in Committee of the whole, because there he should have the privilege of reply— John Campbell said, I hope my Colleague will take no notice of the Gentleman from North-Carolina, whose arm is not long enough to reach South Carolina— Treat him with silent contempt— The same contempt said Stanly that I have long felt for you— Campbell did not rejoin— Eastman called up his bill for a second five years pension to the revolutionary widows— I left the house, and went into the Supreme Court, and heard the argument of Mr Webster on the second Mississippi Slavery case; and the closing argument of Mr Walker the Senator from Mississippi in reply.— The question is whether a State of this Union can constitutionally prohibit the importation within her borders of Slaves as merchandize. Mr Walker threatened tremendous consequences if this right should it be denied to the States, all of which consequences sounded to me like argument for the constitutional authority to prohibit it in all the States, and for the exercise of it— At the adjournment of the Court, near 4. I went into the house, where Mr Evans of Maine was cooling down a personal quarrel between Pickens and Stanly, arising from some brutality of Pickens this morning in reply to Stanly’s speech of last evening.— They finally agreed to consider it on both sides as ridicule— I left the house after 5. went to see John Causten as I had done yesterday at his Uncle’s. He was now up—sore all over but not seriously injured— I walked home and about half past 6. Jeremy Leary died almost without a groan— May God be his reward! The Revd. Mr Donelan had been with him— And I agreed with him upon the arrangements for the funeral to-morrow— "

I walked to the Capitol this morning, with a Spirit humbled to the dust; with a heart melted in sorrow, and a mind, agitated, and confused— The case of the Amistad captives, had been fixed to commence in the Supreme Court this morning— I asked Mr Baldwin if he could consent to apply to the Court to postpone the case until Monday. But he said that he was under a necessity of returning home as soon as possible to attend State Courts about to be in Session— I therefore as soon as the court was opened and the case was called requested as a personal favour of the Court to suspend the proceedings in this case from 2. O’Clock P.M. this day, till Monday; to which Chief Justice Taney answered “certainly.”— We had supposed that upon the motion to dismiss the case, the opening and closing would have been with us, but on submission of the question to the court the Chief Justice said that the question of Jurisdiction being blended with the merits of the cause the opening and closing would be with the Attorney General upon the appeal from the Circuit Court— Mr Gilpin therefore the Attorney General commenced and occupied three hours from 11 to 2 in making a statement of the facts, beginning with the register of the Amistad, in 1838. and ending with the appeal by the District Attorney Holabird from the sentence of the Circuit Court U.S. in Connecticut 29. April 1840— He read most of the proceedings from the printed record and from the Amistad Document H.R.U.S— N. 185 of the last Session of Congress and from the supplementary manuscript record obtained at my motion by certiorari— The Court then adjourned to Monday Morning— I went for 5 minutes into the house of Representatives where I found Mr John Sergeant addressing with great animation the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Bell in the Chair, against the proposed proviso in the general appropriation Bill, to limit the compensation fees of the U.S Clerks of Courts, District Attornies and Marshals— I went over to Mr. Causten’s to see John, but they told me he was much better and was gone to his mother’s— I then walked home, dined, and at 4. p.m. walked in procession to the New Roman Catholic Church of St. Matthew’s, where the funeral service was performed by the Revd. Mr Donelan over the remains of my unfortunate assistant Jeremy Leary— My wife and Mrs Smith attended also at the service— The procession consisted chiefly of the members of the Roman Catholic temperance association of which he was a member— Mr Donelan delivered a short discourse from Book of Wisdom 4.11. “Yea speedily was he taken away lest that wickedness should alter his understanding or deceit beguile his Soul.[”] He was then interred in the new cemetery belonging to this Catholic Church— "

[“]And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there is room.” The parable of the great supper— It was communion day; but the attendance was very thin—not fifty persons and less than half that number of communicants—chiefly women— Mr Wood was really pathetic on the words “and yet there is room.” Boyle wrote a whole volume upon intolerance from the words “compel them to come in[”]— The different views that may be taken of the same text of Scripture testify but the riches and the poverty of the human mind— My Spirit was deeply afflicted. I would have communicated with them, but they decline communicating with all not orthodox in their doctrine of the Trinity— Thomas B. J. Frye was here a few minutes before dinner— After dinner at St John’s Church the Evening prayer for Quinquagesima, or the Sunday before Lent was read by Mr Morgan a young Clergyman from England, who preached a pleasing Sermon from Hebrews 12.22. “and to an innumerable company of Angels.[”]— The doctrine of the Christian dispensation concerning Angels, is mysterious, cheering, and awful— Ministering Spirits, Messengers of weal and wo, numberless, graduated in hierarchies— Cherubim, Seraphim Archangels, Guardians of kingdoms, and of individuals—their nature, their employment, their abode, are all inexplicable to human intelligence, and yet all within the aspirations of human curiosity— Mr Morgan’s sermon was an industrious assemblage of multitudes of passages, in both the old and new Testament illustrative of the character and agency of these supernatural inhabitants of the spiritual world. When I reflected upon them I was almost tempted to address them in prayer— Meditative devotion as it kindles is apt to mislead the judgment, but my impending duties brought me again down to the earth. At the last hour I was yet to prepare a frame for my argument on the case of the Amistad Captives— I must accommodate my plan of extemporaneous discourse to that of the Attorney General scarcely yet unfolded and much also to my colleague’s argument which is yet to come— I began this evening an index to the Documents that I am to review, that I may follow some order in extemporising upon them— Of all that I have written 9 tenths are waste paper.

Mr Rodgers, a Son of the late Commodore Rodgers called on me this morning to make enquiries about an Asylum for insane persons at the town of Pepperell in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts—and whether persons from without the State could be admitted there, and upon what terms.— I told him I had never before heard of such an establishment there—but there was one at Boston, confined I believe to the inhabitants of the town, and one at Worcester for information concerning which I referred him to Governor Lincoln— I walked to the Capitol with a thoroughly bewildered mind— So bewildered as to leave me nothing but fervent prayer, that presence of mind may not utterly fail me at the trial I am about to go through— At the opening of the Court, Judge Thompson read a decision of the Court on a certain case, Mr Norvell, and S. T. Mason both of Michigan were admitted as Attorneys and Counsellors of the Court— The Attorney General Henry A. Gilpin then delivered his argument in the case of the Amistad Captives— It occupied two hours—and after a summary statement of the facts as developed in the documents from which he had copiously read on Saturday, he contended that the Amistad was a regularly documented Spanish Schooner employed in the coasting trade, between the different ports of the Island of Cuba— That the Passports of the passengers were regularly signed by the Governor General of Cuba and proved beyond all controversy that the blacks were the property of Ruiz and Montez— That the Court, by the Comity of Nations could not go behind or enquire into the validity of these documents, for which he cited many authorities in the Law books.— He attempted no argument to show that the right of property remained unimpaired by the insurrection, and insisted that all the negroes ought to be restored to their owners, and that the Circuit Court erred in pronouncing the negroes free— Mr Baldwin followed in a sound and eloquent but exceedingly mild and moderate argument in behalf of the captives till half past 3. when the court adjourned— I went into the house as they were about meeting after the recess— Governor Lincoln proemized, Garret Davis and Saltonstall discoursed and Waddy Thompson, puffed and foamed till between 5 and 6. when I walked home— Elizabeth C. Adams came in by the Railway Cars from Philadelphia. Mrs Thornton, and Mrs Talbot with her daughter here this eve. "

Tuesday  With increasing agitation of mind, now little short of agony I rode in a hack to the Capitol, taking with me in confused order a number of books which I may have occasion to use— The very skeleton of my argument is not yet put together— When the Court met, Judge Wayne, and Judge Story, read in succession two decisions of the Court, and Mr Baldwin occupied the remainder of the day four hours in closing his argument in behalf of the Amistad Captives, and in the support of the decision of the District and Circuit Courts. The point upon which he dwelt with most emphatic earnestness was the motion to dismiss the appeal of the United States, on the contest of their right to appear as parties in the cause they having no interest therein— His reasoning therein was powerful, and perhaps conclusive— But I am apprehensive there are precedents, and an executive influence operating upon the Court, which will turn the balance against us on that point. In commenting upon the insurrection of the blacks, Mr Baldwin firmly maintained their right of self-emancipation, but spoke in cautious terms to avoid exciting Southern passions and prejudices, which it is our policy as much as possible to asswage and pacify— When he came to the point of questioning the validity of the Governor General’s Ladino Passports, he left a good deal still to be said— He closed at half past 3. and left the day open for me to-morrow I went into the Congress Library, and took out for use the 37th. volume of Niles’s register containing the speech of James Madison, in the Virginia Convention on the double condition of Slaves in that State as Persona and as property— I did not wait to attend at the meeting of the house after the recess; but meeting as I was walking home, Mr Brockway, I enquired of him what had been done in the house he told me, that they had agreed to take the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill out of the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union at 5. O’Clock this afternoon. Mr Frisby brought me this morning the new Edition in two large thick 8vo. Volumes of Noah Webster’s Dictionary— The applicants for official appointments are swelling into a multitudes.— Mr Whitcomb heretofore a clerk in the general Land Office, is here and came to solicit my influence for himself and for his son to obtain an appointment as a Cadet at West-Point— Daniel Parkman is also here for an appointment.— Assistant to the Marshal— "

Adams came afterwards— I was busied in preparation in the Clerk of the Supreme Court’s room, nearly an hour to the moment of the meeting of the Court— When that was opened Josiah Randall, and Mr Polk now a Clerk in the Department of War were admitted as Attornies and Counsellors of the Court, and Chief Justice Taney announced to me, that the Court were ready to hear me— The judges present were Taney, Story, Thompson M’Lean, Baldwin, Wayne, Barbour and Catron. Judge M’Kinley has been present during any part of this trial— The Court room was full, but not crowded, and there were not many Ladies. I had been deeply distressed and agitated till the moment when I rose, and then my Spirit did not sink within me— With grateful heart for aid from above, though in humiliation for the weakness incident to the limits of my powers, I spoke four hours and a half, with sufficient method and order to witness little flagging of attention, by the judges or the auditory; till at half past 3. O’Clock, when the Chief Justice said the Court would hear me further to-morrow— Mr Baldwin mentioned that he would stay and hear me to-morrow, but that he should be obliged to leave the City on Friday to return home. The structure of my argument so far as I have yet proceeded is perfectly simple and comprehensive—needing no artificial division into distinct points, but admitting the steady and undeviating pursuit of one fundimental principle, the ministration of Justice— I then assigned my reason for invoking Justice, specially, aware that this was always the duty of the court; but because an immense array of power, the executive administration, instigated by the Minister of a foreign Nation has been brought to bear in this case on the side of injustice— I then commenced a review of the Correspondence between the Secretary of State, and the Spanish Ministers Calderon and Argaiz, which I analyzed with critical research as far as I was able, but with not half the acuteness nor with a tenth part of the vigour which I would have applied had they been at my command— I did not I could not answer public expectation—but I have not yet utterly failed— God speed me to the end. After the adjournment of the Court, I went for a few minutes into the house, but they were yet in recess— I rode home with Mr Smith and Elizabeth C. Adams at 4. General Dearborn called here, while I was absent— After dinner, a written inventory was taken by Mr Smith, signed by him and Patrick Wilson, of all the effects left by my poor deceased Jeremy Leary— Thomas Dumphy and myself were present all the time—the effects as far as possible were packed in his trunk which was locked up, and I have the key.

The agitation of mind under which I have been labouring for weeks had yesterday gradually subsided in a continuous extemporaneous discourse of four hours and a half through which I was enabled to pass; but the exhaustion consequent upon the effort, and the remnant of mental solicitude still heavily weighing down my Spirits— I had an uneasy restless night, and short, not undisturbed repose— I rose however with much encouraged and cheerful feelings and performed the daily task of recording the transactions of yesterday— General Dearborn called on me immediately after breakfast.— He comes to solicit restitution to the Office of Collector of the Customs at Boston; from which he was removed by Andrew Jackson in March 1829. I told him that if my opinion, or my testimony should be asked, I would give either, favourably to him; but that I had felt it my duty not in any case of appointment to office to volunteer with either advice, opinion or recommendation— He said he thought me perfectly right, and entirely satisfied with my personal disposition in his favour— Mr Smith and Elizabeth C. Adams rode with me to the Capitol: about an hour before the Meeting of the Supreme Court; while I had proposed to examine and collect papers and authorities for the conclusion of my argument; on going into the Clerk’s room, I learnt that Philip P. Barbour of Virginia, one of the judges of the Court before whom I had yesterday argued, was found dead in his bed, as if yet asleep and without the appearance of having suffered a pang— I soon after saw judge Wayne, who told me that the court had been in consultation last evening till ten O’Clock; that he had afterwards had some private conversation with judge Barbour who then parted from him in remarkably cheerful good humour and retired to bed— He appears to have passed from sleep to death without a moment of conscious suffering.— At 11. O’Clock the surviving judges came in; excepting judge M’Kinley—all in their robes, and in procession— They took their Seats and Chief Justice Taney said— One of the judges of the Court, brother Barbour is dead— The Court will adjourn till monday— The Court was immediately adjourned— Mr Baldwin took leave of me, saying he was obliged to leave the city this afternoon, to return home— I went into the house, where I found M’Kay in the Chair, in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the Navy Appropriation Bill— I soon retired to the room of the Clerk and examined the records of the Circuit Court in the case of the Antelope— Returned after the recess to the house where they were debating the Navy Appropriation Bill— About 6 O’Clock I came home leaving the house in committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Russel Freeman was here after dinner for advice how to apply for restitution to his Office of Collector of the Port of New Bedford, which I gave him— And John Leary came in from Quincy, whence he started immediately after hearing of his brother Jeremy’s disaster.

John Evans Sexton of St. Patrick’s Church was here this morning, and I paid him for digging the grave for Jeremy Leary in the Cemetery of that Church— A clergyman named Robert A Stevens, keeper of an orphan school near Baltimore, established by himself, came for a contribution— I went with John Leary to the judge of the Orphan’s Court Causten, to apply for a Letter of Administration for him on the goods and effects of his deceased brother Jeremy— The judge required him to execute a bond with two sureties, with a penalty of 500 dollars, before the Letter of Administration could be delivered to him— He then executed the bond which I signed with him as one of the sureties. I proposed to ask Mr W. S. Smith to sign as the other— I took this opportunity also to write a Letter to the judge, declining to accept the trust, as Co-executor with Richard Smith, of the last Will and Testament of Mrs. Elizabeth Kortwright Hay, who died last year at Paris, leaving this Will— And then I went to the Office of the Mayor W. W. Seaton, and answered certain interrogatories of Dr Robert Mayo, concerning, a suit for Slander brought by him against Blair and Rives, publishers of the Globe— Dr. Mayo had sent me three interrogatories, the first two of which I declined answering, as they were of opinions and not of facts— I answered the 3d. which was of the manner in which he had become possessed of Andrew Jackson’s confidential Letter to Fulton the Secretary of the Territory of Arkansas of the 10th of December 1830, as stated by himself to me, when he communicated the Letter to me— Young Robert Brent was there as the Doctor’s Lawyer, and Mr Rives of the Globe, with Mr Hoban a lawyer.— Mr Seaton swore me upon the book— It was one O’Clock when I reached the house, and I found them in a snarl between Linn Banks who had offered a Resolution to adjourn from 3 to 4. O’Clock to attend the funeral of judge Barbour, and Wise who opposed it because the same respect had not been shewn to Chief Justice Marshall. The Resolution was however carried— I attended the funeral obsequies, performed in the room of the Supreme Court by the Chaplains of the two houses of Congress, Braxton and Cookman— President Van Buren, and all the members of his Cabinet were there The Senate in a body—but very few members of the House, and excepting the Attorney General, the only Member of the Bar that I saw there was Walter Jones with whom and his Son, I rode part of the way to the Eastern Branch Cemetery, and then returned to the Capitol, where at 4. O’Clock the house met again— At 5. I came home, and then went and dined with Mr Daniel D. Barnard— There I met Mr Abbot Lawrence, Mr Philip Hone, and two or three other Gentlemen, and the Symposiacs continued till 10. at Night. "

Mr Smith went with me this morning to the Office of Register of Wills at the City Hall, and signed the Administration bond of John Leary, to administer the goods and effects of his deceased brother Jeremy.

Jones.— Slavery is already hurling thunderbolts at the President-elect and the Northern portion of his cabinet— Francis Granger who is to be the Postmaster General, is violently assailed for abolitionism— He took me aside this morning, and assured me that there was not a man living, whose good opinion he would be more unwilling to forfeit than mine. He attempted an explanation of a statement in the Richmond whig concerning the slave question between New-York and Virginia, which considering what he had said to me on the subject had almost surprized me— His explanation was by no means satisfactory, but he said he should ultimately be justified.— I asked Cushing for some Spanish history which he promised me, but he was immediately after called to the Chair of the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union upon the army appropriation Bill, and was there till the recess— I then rode home, stopping at the National Intelligencer Office, and leaving there with Mr Seaton, a list of the Petitions, not presented by me since the 21st. of January, the last day upon which petitions have been received by the house; which I requested him and which he promised to publish— He and Mr Gales both told me that they had Wheeler’s report of my reply to Wise and would publish it early next week— After dinner Jeremiah Pendergast and Thomas Dumphy Made by warrant from the judge of the Orphan’s Court an inventory and appraizement of the effects of Jeremy Leary to be returned on Monday to the Court—amounting to 472 dollars 31 cents. Mr W. S.

Adams, and Mary to the Capitol, where the Hall of the House of Representatives was so excessively crowded that it was with extreme difficulty that we were enabled to obtain seats— The Chaplains of both houses, were in enclosure where the Speaker’s chair is usually placed but whence it was now removed into the platform of the Clerk’s table. Mr Cookman preached a farewell Sermon, from Revelation 20.11. “And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. 12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God: and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works— 13. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.” A discourse upon the day of judgment— It appeared to me, that the subject was above the powers of the Speaker—perhaps above the powers of mortal man—but it was listened to with deep attention, from beginning to end. Mr. Cookman closed with a farewell address to the members of both houses of Congress and then to the Citizens of Washington— He should be hereafter stationed by the Methodist conference which three years ago had stationed him here—at a distant place— That he was going now very shortly to the land of his nativity, England to visit an aged father, and the grave of a dearly beloved mother, and after six Months he should return to this his adopted country where thenceforth he intended to live and to die, and for whose prosperity and happiness, whether absent or present he should never cease to offer up daily prayers to heaven. This part of the discourse was quite pathetic, and drew forth sundry white handkerchiefs among the Ladies.— There was a small choir of singers in the front galleries who sung the hymns— Mr Braxton made the prayers after the Sermon. I took leave of Mr Cookman, at the outer door of the House of Representatives, wishing him all prosperity and happiness.— His ministration has been pleasant and I hope useful to me— I parted from the Ladies and walked home, stopping on my way, at Gadsby’s hotel to visit Mr and Mrs Abbott Lawrence who are here with their daughter and a young son— I met there General Scott, and a young man named Cutts, keeper of the documents of the house. General Wool came in while I was there— After dinner at St. John’s Church, there were two clergymen, with Mr Hawley. Mr Parker who read the Evening service for the first Sunday in Lent, and Mr Curtis of New-York, who preached from Psalm 8.3.

What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?” Evening past in preparation for to-morrow— "

They immediately adjourned, and went into the hall of the house of Representatives— They had not yet re-assembled after the recess— But Mr William L. Stone, Editor of the Commercial advertiser of New-York came to the apologize to me, for two heavy Letters addressed to him from New-Orleans, under cover to me at this place, for my frank— I put them into the Post-Office without franking them, and Mr Stone had to pay the postage for them— He came to me to say that he had spoken to me of certain manuscript public documents for which he had desired the privilege of my frank—instead of which his correspondent had written him Letters. Mr Blunt came very abruptly to my seat—said he was sent here by Mr Charles King, who was anxiously desirous of obtaining the Office of Postmaster at New-York, and wished me to use my influence in his favour— I told him I had no influence to use in favour of any one; and that I had no right to recommend any one. But consider said he, that he threw himself into the breach for you— Not at all I replied, and you may tell Mr Charles King that I consider myself under any thing but obligation to him— Oh! I only meant to say— I stop’d him short, and said I would hold no further conversation with him on the subject—left my seat and came home to dinner— Returned after dinner, and Elizabeth C. Adams went to judge Cranch’s W. Cost Johnson attempted to get up a bill from the Senate to recharter the District Banks which failed and the house adjourned at 8. In the Senate, Linn’s attack on Webster— At judge Cranch’s— Home with Elizabeth— Mrs Barney, and her stepson. Mr Mayer and Mrs D. Hoffman— Report of my Speech. "

I found on my table last evening, Wheeler’s Report of my speech, on the Treasury Note Bill; deliveredplanting the standard against that of Wise— There were 109. pages of it in Wheeler’s writing—with only 5 lines to a page. I sat up till near one this morning to revise it, and only finished hastily the revisal this morning.— It needs a more thorough revisal— Russel Freeman here. Shewed me copy of his application for restoration to the Collectorship of New-Bedford. His anxiety intense—piteous. Visit from William Jackson of Newtown with Mr Lovering of Boston— I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer and left with Mr Gales the Report of my Speech—but it will not be published within a week. H.R.U.S. The house yesterday resolved to meet the two remaining days of the Session at 10. of the morning; and to devote 2 hours each day, from 10 to 12 to private business. W. Cost Johnson renewed his attempt to call up the District Banks bill from the Senate and failed again— Committee of the whole on private Bills, Briggs in the chair— At 11. I went into the Supreme Court. The judges Catron and Wayne, delivered each one decision of the Court, and judge Story, two— That of Wayne, was in favour of the Bank of the Metropolis vs the U.S. and one of those delivered by judge Story reversed the decision of the U.S. Circuit Court in Missouri in the case of U.S. vs Charles Gratiot— The delivery of these opinions occupied an hour and a half— Walter Jones, Counsel for Lieutt. Gedney, upon his claim for salvage in the case of the Amistad and the captives, rose to deliver an argument, but was stop’d by Chief-Justice Taney, who said the Court would hear no argument upon that claim until after their decision upon the motion to dismiss the appeal of the U.S.— The Attorney General Gilpin then closed the argument on the part of U.S. in about 3 hours—reviewing with great moderation of manner, chiefly Mr Baldwin’s argument, and very slightly noticing mine— When he finished, the Court adjourned— The judges present were Taney, Story, Thompson, M’Lean, Baldwin, Wayne and Catron— Barbour having been taken away by death in the midst of the trial; and M’Kinley, having been throughout the trial absent— When the house met after the recess, Wise was in the chair of the Committee of the whole upon the West Point Academy Bill— I came home and dined. Returned to the house at 6. p.m. My wife and Mrs. W. S. Smith, went with me as far as Mrs Hellen’s— West-point Bill reported and passed— Committee of the whole Medill in the Chair— Chaos— Stanly introduced Mr Badger to me. Patterson of New-York— Solomon Lincoln rode with me to his lodgings: and Mr Saltonstall, who is quite unwell— Home at 10. P.M. "

Conversation with Solomon Lincoln, who told me that he had been invited to come here, upon a very numerous, and respectable recommendation of young men, altogether unexpected and unsolicited by him—but that when he arrived here he found that Governor Levi Lincoln had step’d forward and ranged himself among the candidates— That there was some objection to him as a member actual elect of Congress; but that from his standing and preponderance of pretensions, he would probably be appointed— I know not why, but it seemed to me as if Levi Lincoln, shrunk in all his proportions into the dimensions of a pigmy, from a nine years Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to a Collector of the Customs at Boston— Solomon Lincoln said he should not stay to see the pageant to-morrow, but would depart in the Cars this afternoon— He mentioned to me also my Son’s report of the joint Committee of the Massachusetts Legislature on the North-eastern boundary question, and the movements of Theophilus Parsons, a chip of the old block, and now a Senator from Boston, to take it out of his hands.— I went into the Supreme Court, where James T.

Inauguration William Henry Harrison P.U.S.  The inauguration of William Henry Harrison as President of the United States was celebrated with demonstrations of popular feeling, unexampled since that of Washington in 1789. and at the same time with so much order and tranquility, that not the slightest symptom of conflicting passions occurred to disturb the enjoyments of the day. Many thousands of the people from the adjoining and considerable numbers from distant States had come to witness the ceremony: the procession consisting of a mixed military and civil cavalcade and platoons of volunteer Militia companies—tippecanoe clubs, students of colleges and school boys, with about half a dozen veterans who had fought under the hero in the war of 1800, with sundry aukward and ungainly painted banners and log cabins, without any carriages or showy dresses was characteristic of the democracy of our institutions, while the perfect order with which the whole scene was performed and the absence of all pageantry was highly creditable to them— The numbers were not comparable to those of the military assemblage at Baltimore upon the reception of La Fayette in 1824. nor was there any thing now of the pride pomp and circumstance of that day. The coup d’oeil of this day was showy-shabby— The procession passed before the windows of my house— General Harrison was on a mean looking white horse in the centre of seven others, in a plain frock coat or surtout, undistinguishable from any of those before, behind, or around him. He proceeded thus to the Capitol; where from the top of the flight of steps at the Eastern front, he read his inaugural address, occupying about an hour in the delivery; and before pronouncing the last paragraph of which the Oath of Office was administered to him by Chief Justice Taney— The procession then returned to the Presidents house, and he retired to his chamber, while an immense crowd of people filled for an hour or more all the lower rooms of the house. I saw the procession pass from my chamber windows— Mr Leavitt was with me, and we were reading the opinions of the judges Davies and William Johnson, in the case of the Antelope.— Mr Leavitt departed by the Cars for New-York this afternoon— Richard Cutts had been here this morning, with Messrs. Duralde, Nye, and another from New-Orleans. After dinner I walked up the Pennsylvania avenue to Mrs Peyton’s, and visited Charles Ogle, who since Christmas day when he had engaged to dine with me, but was seized with a hemorrhage of the lungs, has been confined to his chamber, irrecoverable— I met there John W. Allen of Ohio. Elizabeth C. Adams went with Miss Cutts to the inauguration Ball, at the old theatre in Louisiana avenue. "

Lay of Batavia, New-York, was here, all last Evening—a Candidate for the Office of the Chargé d’Affaires at Naples— He was a member of the 23d. and 24th. Congresses, always kind and friendly to me— He says he does not want the Office, but his friends are extremely anxious to impose it upon him— They invited him to come here—but upon his arrival he found that Mr Henry A. Wise, is as thirsty for it as himself; and will probably get it— He has numerous recommendatory Letters among which one from Phineas L. Tracy to General Harrison himself of which Lay doubted whether he should present it, and asked my opinion of it— I advised him by all means to present it, and told him it would probably be more effective than all the rest put together— Mr Lay wished for a Letter from me; but I have no right to give him one— Mr Waters was here this morning and had the same intense desire equally unavailing— Mr Robbins was not less solicitous for his friend Schuyler Sampson— For him I had already done all that it was possible for me to do— To escape further importunities, which would have consum the whole day, I rode to the Capitol, and heard Mr John Whipple of Rhode-Island arguing that cause of his State against Massachusetts for sundry towns on her borders— He was harping upon an alledged mistake by Commissioners who settled the question 122 years ago— The pleader is worthy of the cause— I went into the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, and looked over the documents transmitted with the Message communicating the Slave trade correspondence; and particularly that of Trist, which is enormous— I read rapidly through Alexander H. Everett’s report upon Trist’s official conduct at the Havanna— It is perfectly conclusive of the guilt of Trist, in conniving at, aiding and abetting by all means in his power the African Slave trade by Americans, Portuguese and Spaniards— I came home at 3. P.M— E. G. Pendleton of Cincinnati, Ohio had been here with his brother from the State of New-York— The former had left a pair of silk gloves, a present, with a Letter from Mrs Hannah Myers Price of Cincinnati. After dinner, Mr Luther C. Peck, was here, with Mr Patterson from the Western part of the State of New-York, and a brother of the late General Brown. He asked me who wrote the order from the War Department announcing the decease of General Brown— I said I wrote it myself—he said he had always thought so— Mr Delano and Mr Taylor are projectors of different inventions which I do not understand— Kavassales is a Greek student educated in this Country, of ardent Anti-Slavery principles— Mr John Connell was here late this Evening— Desponding.

The Weather for a week before and on the inauguration day was fair, soft and Springlike— That night a change came over the atmosphere, and yesterday morning there was frost in the ground and snow upon it— The day and last night were continually inclement, and this morning there was a whole carpet of snow upon the surface— In the course of the day it softened into sleet, then into rain, and this evening cleared into Moonshine— Before Noon I rode to the Capitol and found the suit between Massachusetts and Rhode-Island, yet pending before the Court— Mr Whipple was finishing, and the court postponed the case till Monday to hear the closing argument of Massachusetts by Mr Webster— He was yesterday nominated by President Harrison, and this day confirmed by the Senate to be Secretary of State— The other heads of Departments were also nominated and all confirmed yesterday, except the Postmaster General Francis Granger, whose nomination was laid over this day, and then confirmed by a party vote. In the Supreme Court there was some question between Mr Walker the Senator from Mississippi and Mr Coxe, and between Mr Crittenden the new Attorney General, and Mr. Key, upon certain pending cases, but of little interest— The ex-Attorney General Gilpin was there, shorn of his beams, and having apparently nothing to do— Walker of Mississippi came to me and said he wondered how any one could ever have thought that the case of the Amistad had any thing to do with abolition.— Peters is too confident of a decision of the Court in our favour— My anxiety for it is intense, and deeply distrustful— I went into the Office of the Clerk of the house and spent two hours in reading over Trist’s correspondence which is indescribable, and inconceivable.— There is great disorder both in his head and heart; each of which panders to the other— He complains of an affection of the head.— When I came home I found at my house a black man, named John Francis Cook, who left a Letter handsomely written by himself, with an engraved Portrait of Cinque, sent me as a present by Mr Robert Purvis of Philadelphia. I had received a copy of the same portrait from Mr. Lewis Tappan and another from I know not whom.— This Evening I was visited by Mr Isaiah Thomas and Mr Jacob M. Howard of Detroit, Michigan. Mr Thomas is a Grandson of Isaiah Thomas of Worcester; the patriarch of the printing press in New-England, and founder of the American Antiquarian Society— Mr Howard is the member elect of the House of Representatives from Michigan— They had heard my second day’s argument in the case of the Amistad captives and spoke much of it— [symbols] that although I fell immeasurably short of my wishes in that case, I did not utterly disappoint the public expectation.

I attended divine service this morning at the second Presbyterian Church, where Mr Wood preached from Genesis 49.10—[“]and unto him shall the gathering of the people be”—one of the most remarkable passages, of that most mysterious and incomprehensible chapter— This passage is generally understood as referring to the Messiah— But why he is called by the name of Shiloh; why it is said that the Sceptre shall not depart from Judah when it was held by Benjamin in the person of Saul, before it came to Judah in the person of David—when ten tribes passed from Judah to Ephraim in the persons of Rehoboam, and Jeroboam, and when both the Sceptres departed in the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities from four to five hundred years before Shiloh came; who, if the Messiah, paid, himself tribute to Caesar, as Jesus Christ in his human character was a lineal descendant from David, his kingdom might be truly called in a spiritual sense the restitution of the Sceptre of Judah, but how it could be said not to have departed till he came, implying that it did depart when he came, I cannot readily discern— I heard on Christmas day, I think 1788. a Sermon from Bishop Bass at Newburyport, about this Sceptre of Judah, and Shiloh, of which I have longed for a clear exposition ever since—for it excited without satisfying curiosity. Mr Wood now of course understands Shiloh, to mean the Messiah, and his discourse presented a parallel and a contrast between the gathering of the People to the Messiah and that to General Harrison at his inauguration during the past week as President of the United States— Mr Wood has an idea quite sufficiently exalted and not a little exaggerated of the magnitude and importance of the induction of a President of the United States into office, and he dwelt faithfully upon the infinite superior importance of the gathering of the people to the Sceptre of the Messiah— He called upon his people, pathetically, affectionately fervently to join this gathering upon which he said their eternall salvation depended— The house of worship was very thinly attended; as it was after dinner at St. John’s church.— There the Revd. Mr Morgan, read the Evening service for the second Sunday in Lent, and preached from 1 Corinthians 3.11. [“]For other foundation can no man, lay, than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ”— This gentleman is not very eloquent, nor very logical—but there is an air of deep sincerity in every thing that he says, which is better than eloquence— We had evening visits from my neighbour Mr Parris, and Mr William Willis of Portland Maine— Letter to my wife from my Son—part of whose report, as chairman of a joint Committee of the Legislature of Massachusetts on the Northeastern boundary question, I read. It was unanimously adopted by the Committee and adopted by the two houses—and it is very creditable to him. "

I had no time to attend to him and asked him to call again to-morrow.

Mr Freeman called early this morning to take leave and say that he had seen Mr Webster, who assured him that if the appointment of Collector at New-Bedford depended upon his Department, he would be very favourably disposed towards him. With this cheering encouragement Mr Freeman goes home, to expectation and disappointment— The Revd. Mr Bulfinch now Pastor of the Unitarian church came to represent his claim to some office in one of the Departments; because having been appointed during my administration, to a clerkship of 800 dollars, he had under the Jackson rule been unjustly dismissed for pretended inefficiency in the performance of his duties— He requested a Letter of recommendation from me, which I declined to give because I give none. Elizabeth and Mr Smith rode with me to the Capitol— I waited upon tenterhooks, half an hour for the meeting of the Court— A young man named Charles Hopkins from Vermont came and requested me to present him for admission as an Attorney and Counsellor of the Court, which I did— He told me he had already been admitted to the Circuit Court— He was accordingly admitted and sworn.— Judge Story delivered the opinion and decree of the court in the case of the United States Appellants vs the Schooner Amistad. It affirms the decision of the District and Circuit Courts excepting with regard to the Negroes— It reverses the decision below placing them at the disposal of the President of the United States to be sent to Africa; declares them to be free and directs the Circuit Court to order them to be discharged from the custody of the Marshal— Judge Baldwin expressed some dissent from the opinion which I did not hear nor did I learn what it was— I went to the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures and wrote to Mr Roger S. Baldwin at New-Haven, and to Mr Lewis Tappan of New-York to inform them of the decision of the Court, and gave the Letters to Mr M’Cormick the Postmaster of the House— The Court had adjourned— I went into the Senate chamber, and heard a fiery debate on the proposed resolution to dismiss Blair and Rives as the Printers of the Senate— Henry Clay closed a short, and intemperate speech by declaring some personalities uttered against him by William R. King of Alabama false—untrue—and cowardly. The Senate shortly after adjourned; but in the meantime Dr Linn of Missouri had delivered a note from Mr King to Mr Clay, and there was a rumour that King and Clay were both arrested by warrants from a magistrate. I went to the Office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court and wrote a motion for a mandate to the marshal of the District of Connecticut to discharge forthwith the Amistad captives from custody.— I called on Mr Crittenden the New Attorney General to ask his consent to this motion— He said he saw no objection to it— I had Evening visits from Mr and Mrs Downing of Florida, and from Elisha Whittlesey with Mr Fosdick— I saw Mr Gales at the National Intelligencer Office.

I left Speaker Hunter’s due bill for the balance of my pay 573:60. at the Department, and the money was sent to my house in the course of the morning. I spoke of the application of Schuyler Sampson for renomination as collector at Plymouth, but found that the complaints against him for interference in the late election’s had blasted his expectations. Mr Ewing did not directly say so; but I saw it in his manner— I said I had heard there were complaints against some of his inspectors in other towns, but not against himself; and I remarked that a considerable majority of the people of the town of Plymouth were friends of the late Administration— I spoke also of the Smithsonian fund and of its mismanagement, but said I would see him again on that subject when he should be more at leisure— Mr Smith rode with me to the Capitol— I withdrew the motion for a mandate to the Marshal of the District of Connecticut, forthwith to discharge the Africans of the Amistad, at the suggestion of Judge Thompson who assured me that he would see to it, and that they should be discharged within three or four days.— The Chief Justice read the decision of the Court against Massachusetts upon the demurrer in the case with Rhode-Island— Neither Austin nor Webster was there— Peters made a motion for them, which Whipple opposed, and the Court compromised— The Chief Justice read an opinion upon the Mississippi Slavery case, whereupon judge M’lean took from his pocket and read a counter-opinion, unexpectedly, to the other judges; to which the judges Thompson, Baldwin and M’Kinley severally replied, each differing from all the others— About one, the Court adjourned without day.

Holabird to the Secretary of State Forsyth of 20. Decr. 1839. and the despatch of Nicholas P. Trist Consul at the Havana, of 22. May 1838— They were brought to me, and I perceived immediately why, about half the despatch, and the whole of Holabird’s letter had been suppressed in the communications to the House of Representatives— I requested Mr Webster to say that I wanted copies of those papers, and should be glad if he would furnish me with them— If he thought they could not be furnished without a call from Congress, I should be under a necessity of moving a call at the next Session— While I was at the Office, Mr Rice Garland, and Mr Chinn of Louisiana successively came in— I called at C. J. Nourse’s Office and exchanged 40 half-eagles for Virginia Bills at 3 1/4 per cent discount. Met in the Capitol a second time a ragged man named Coulter, who claimed a gift of an old coat, as a reward, for having as he alledged caught and secured my horses at that dreadful disaster of the 18th. of last Month— He had no testimony but his own declaration— I gave him a half eagle but he knew not, and enquired what it was.

Yet I could not confine myself entirely to the house— I called at Gadsby’s to have some conversation with Mr Abbott Lawrence, who is in the confidence of Mr Webster, and is in frequent consultation with President Harrison’s cabinet.— I asked him if their system of administration was settled, and organized—not yet— Was the revenue to be bared on the compromise of 1833—between Calhoun and Clay, the South and the West, to the total exclusion of the North, and especially of New-England? He thought not. Certainly not with his consent— I said Mr Cushing was supposed to be more in the confidence of Mr Webster than any other member of the Massachusetts delegation in the house; and Cushing had offered in the house to take the basis of the compromise, which had instantly been seized upon by the whigs of the South, who were for nailing us down to it; till Governor Lincoln was forced to declare his dissent to it— I had said nothing but had not felt the less— As Mr Webster was now at the head of the Cabinet, I was assured that the interests of New-England would have their due weight in it, and to such a compromise would give my hearty assent and support—but to nothing based on the compromise of 1833. Mr Lawrence said that Cushing’s declaration was unauthorised and injudicious— That there was a Letter written on the same occasion, published in the Boston Atlas, and an editorial Article countenancing that same statement of Cushing’s— That Haughton the Editor of the Atlas afterwards came here, and was taken sick. That he Mr Lawrence, asked him what he meant by publishing those Articles, and Haughton had told him it was all a mistake done in his absence, without his knowledge or consent. Mr Lawrence said that he and Nathan Appleton had both corresponded with R. B. Rett of S.C. concerning the Tariff—and Mr Rhett had written to him that he should consider any departure from the compromise as a breach of faith— He looked for the copy of his Letter to Mr Rhett to shew me, but could not find it— He said he would converse with Mr Webster and see me again— At Gales and Seaton’s office I found they had not received from Mr Carroll the copy of the opinion of the Supreme Court in the case of the Amistad. I went to the Capitol, and with Mr Carroll collated the copy with the original draught by Judge Story.— We noted two or three mistakes to be minuted— A copy of the decree was added and I took it to the Office of the National Intelligencer and delivered it to Mr Gales.— He informed me that the Senate had adjourned over to next Monday, after advising and consenting to the nomination of Ogden Hoffman as U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New-York— Mr Lawrence had told me, that they had confirmed the nomination of Solomon Lincoln as Marshal of the District of Massachusetts— Closed a Letter to my Son.

O’Clock my time is still absorbed by visitors, who suspend all regular occupation without always affording an equivalent of utility.— The first two this morning were Messrs. Tillman and Bates of Detroit, Michigan—total Strangers to me, but who called to see me from mere curiosity— Mr Bacon is the person from New-Haven with whom I have heretofore conversed concerning the Slave factories on the coast of Africa; and with which he has been familiarly acquainted— Mr Fendall brought me a note from Mr W. C. Preston requesting a testimonial from me in Fendall’s behalf to obtain for him an appointment— I had received a similar Letter from W. C. Dawson— I answered Mr Preston’s Note— The Ladies came to take leave of my family— Mr Dunn is a native of the State of Maine, settled at Fredericton in the British Province of New-Brunswick. He wishes for the appointment of U.S. Consul at St. John—the present incumbent being as he says, not a present Citizen of the United States— He complained also that in that Province an alien poll tax is laid upon American Citizens residing there, and, enquired if they were not entitled to exemption from such a tax by some treaty stipulation— I told him I knew of no such stipulation, which he seemed to consider as very surprizing; and I advised him to apply in pursuit of both his enquiries to the Department of State— I called on the new Postmaster General, Mr Granger, and left with him, a petition, addressed to his predecessor John M. Niles, from James Tucker and others of Stoughton and Canton, praying for a new Post-Office in that vicinity— Also a singular petition for the appointment of Abraham Bowen as Postmaster at Fall river with a strange advertisement in a Newspaper—and I gave him to read but took back an equally strange Letter from Bowen to me— Mr Granger said he thought it was an application for the appointment of a blacky. I spoke to him also of the case of Luther Angier which he said had been mentioned to him by Mr Lawrence. I received a Note from Fletcher Webster stating that his father thought he must decline furnishing the copies of papers which I desired.— I dined with President Harrison, with a company consisting of Messrs. Badger, Bates, Bayard, Bell Burnet, Calhoun, Chambers, H. Clay, Crittenden, Evans, Ewing, Rice Garland, Gilpin, Granger, Henderson, R. M. Johnson, Lawrence, Morehead, Paulding, Preston, Rives, Southard, Tallmadge, Todd, Tyler, Solomon Van Rensselaer, Webster and Woodbury. Crittenden told me he was going to attend the trial of M’Leod at Albany; and asked my opinion which I gave him, against making a National issue on this case. "

Fair and mild morning—rain afternoon North west Sky-scraper at the going down of the Sun for a hard frosty night— Morning worship at the Presbyterian church— Heard Mr Wood from Isaiah 55.6 “Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near”— The compositions of the old and new Testament must not be examined by the Grecian Schools of Rhetoric or of Logic— The unities of Aristotle have no more application to Hebrew Literature than his syllogisms have to their reasoning— The Old Covenant from the narrative of the creation in the book of Genesis to the prophet Malachi, has constant reference to the advent of the Messiah, and the whole new Covenant is an exposition of his life and doctrines, and of the first sixty years of their history— Every part of these books should be read with an historical and chronological . . ..— The books properly historical are from Genesis to Nehemiah, and bring the history down to the rebuilding of the temple about 450 years before Christ— The prophets come down about 50 years later— There is an interval of 400 years partially supplied by the Wars of the Maccabees— At the birth of Christ Judea is a Roman Province, governed by a tributary dependent Prince and by Roman Proconsuls— The Books of the sixteen prophets were all written immediately preceding or during the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities— The greatest of them all is Isaiah, which is at once history, prophecy, and Poetry— There is in it no unity of composition, and it might as well be divided into 20 books as compiled in one— It comprizes a period of nearly 60 years, and between the different parts of the book there is no apparent connection— The 54th. and 55th. chapters are written in a tone of cheering and rapturous enthusiasm— Its power in the original hebrew can be conceived only by reflecting how immeasurably all poetical beauty withers in any translation. Yet the verse selected by Mr Wood for his text seems to have no peculiar connection with the rest of the chapter in which it is found. His application of it was to the all absorbing doctrine of the atonement; and he waged it in the solemn and gloomy tone which is perhaps is the temper of a mind brooding over disappointment— After the morning service I walked to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and desired Mr Seaton to discard from the publication in to-morrows paper of the opinion and decree of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of the Amistad, a note which I had left with Mr Gales, to rectify what I supposed to be a mistake in the date of the decree of the District judge—stated to be the 23d. of January 1830. and which I thought was on the 13th.— The opinion of the judge was delivered on that day—but the decree was issued on the 23d— Evening service at St. John’s—Mr Hawley read the prayers for the 3d. Sunday in Lent and preached from Acts 8.21. [“]Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right, in the sight of God.”— Evening not sufficiently cheerful. "

Monday  The Missionary to China Dr Parker was here this morning, and told me he was to leave the City to-morrow morning, for New-York, and thence to China, by the way of England. He read to me a Letter which he has written to Mr Webster, urging what he had recommended before the appointment of a Minister from the U.S. to China; and without naming, yet designating me as peculiarly suited for such a mission.— He enquired if the President could not institute the mission without an act of Congress— I said not without an Appropriation— He said that the time of the year was essential to depart not later than the 1st. of June, to accommodate the voyage to the Monsoon.— I said it would at all events be impossible this year, even if there should be a special Session of Congress this summer— I observed that Mr Hawes and Mr Cushing, members of the Committee of foreign Affairs had asked me if I would go on such a mission if tendered to me, and whether I would support in the House a motion for such a mission— I had said that I could not answer the question whether I would go, before it was asked—neither could I support a motion for the mission, knowing that it might be offered to me— Dr Parker supposes that the offer of our mediation between Great-Britain and China, might be useful and highly politic—but the time has not yet come either in our own history or in that of China, for a diplomatic mission, from the United States to the celestial empire, nor are our own relations with Great-Britain on a footing to make an offer of mediation from us, between her and another power acceptable.— Morning visits from Mr Weaver and Mr Burch both of whom are candidates for office to whom I wish well— I called at the Treasury, where Mr M’Clintock Young still acting as Chief Clerk informed me that instructions had been given to the Collector at New-London, to issue a Register or enrollment for the Schooner Amistad— At the Department of State, I left with Mr Fletcher Webster, Letters from Mr N. Amory, and from Mr Ferdinand Clark, asking for the appointment of U.S. Consul at the Havana—also a minute to look up Instructions to the District Attorney in Connecticut and his answers between September 1839. and January 1840— And a request that the Marshal for the District of Connecticut may be instructed to rectify his return of the Census, with the Africans of the Amistad returned as Slaves— The Postmaster General Granger not at his office— At the Capitol, I took most of my papers, Petitions from my draw in the house, and procured several documents.

After near a fortnight since the expiration of the Session of Congress I have not yet been able to assort and file one half the Letters and papers which have accumulated on my table— This morning a young man named Taylor came to ask for an answer to repeated Letters of invitation from a temperance Society at Baltimore to deliver a Lecture before them. I had just answered a Letter from Doctor Charles A. Lee, in behalf of a Temperance Society at New-York of the same purport. I declined in both cases— Mr Kavassales came to renew his solicitation to obtain an appointment of chaplain in the Navy to be stationed in the Mediterranean— I called at the Office of the Postmaster Granger, and left with him, Letters, from Elihu Hobart claiming restitution as Postmaster at Abington, from Isaac Shattuck junr. same at West-Cambridge, and a Petition from Wareham for the removal of David Nye as Postmaster and the appointment of Bartlett Murdock in his place— This I received in a Letter from Jesse Murdock at Carver which I retain. I had also a Letter from James Moorhead of Indiana Pennsylvania, expressing a wish for the appointment of Postmaster there. Mr Granger read this and said it would be necessary that it should be backed by recommendations— The Office was crowded expectants while I was there, and I made my way out as soon as I could. Among the other visitors, were James Monroe and Edward Curtis; both members of the late House of Representatives from the city of New-York— Ogden Hoffman has received the appointment of District Attorney for the Southern District of New-York— I went next to the Navy Department, meeting on my way thither General Macomb who said he was perfectly well, but who is generally supposed to be apoplectic, and Alexander Hodgson who is a candidate to go again to Constantinople, as dragoman to the Legation of the United States— I submitted to Mr Badger the desire of Mr Kavassales to receive an appointment as chaplain in the Navy and suggested his peculiar qualifications as a native of Greece, and as conversant with the Arabick and other oriental languages of that region— Letters from Spotswood an old Virginian in Wiskensin craving the Office of Navy Agent at Norfolk or at Washington—a Letter from William Plumer junr. wishing for the appointment of Navy Agent at Portsmouth New Hampshire, and one from Samuel Burch, to get as a forlorn hope the Office of the Navy Agent in this City. To all these I expect no answer— I only disburthened myself. Miss Cutts was here this Evening, and when her father came for her, he brought with him and introduced Mr Shaw of Maine, an intended biographer of Commodore Samuel Tucker— The Senate adjourned last Evening without day. Just before which Peace was formally proclaimed between H. Clay and W. R. King. "

Mr Lewis Johnson brought me a Letter for Mrs Gay of Hingham. Old Mr Barnes of Barnesville, with his Son, and another neighbour of theirs called upon me— I had not seen Barnes since I was in the white house— He was then deeply concerned in questions as to the direction to be given to the Cumberland road—a work now suspended if not finally abandoned— Mr Barnes who is a Quaker told me sundry anecdotes of his intercourse with Andrew Jackson when he was President, and of his outbursts of Passion, quite amusing— Mr Morehead is the new Senator from Kentucky who takes the place of Mr Crittenden— He came to take leave, with two young men from that State named Wiley and Hart. He said he should leave this City, to return home, in company with Mr Clay, this Evening— Coll. Thomas is a candidate for an appointment, and gave me a history of his life for the last thirty years— He shewed me several warm recommendations, and highly laudatory certificates of character, and intimated a wish to have one from me, which on the general rule which I have adopted and pursued, I declined to give. Mr Lawrence came to take leave— He was to have departed homeward bound this day, but postpones on account of the weather— His daughter went off last Night with Mr and Mrs Preston for Charleston S.C.— Mr Lawrence told me that he had traced to its source the tender by Mr Cushing to the South of our accession to the compromise, that it had been concerted with Mr Preston, and some other person—he meant, but did not name Webster.— The remonstrances against Cushing’s proffer were so immediate and loud that Webster has fallen back, and Cushing will be left to explain or to back out— Ewing is for Bank, discriminating duties, distribution of the proceeds of the public lands, and ample provision for the payment of the public debt, principal and interest— Wise claims the mission to Paris, but will accept the place of Charge d’Affaires to Naples— He made his anti-tariffs dueling nullification speech to shew his teeth; and Mr Lawrence says he told Webster that the best thing he could do with him would be to pack him off and get rid of him. Mr Lawrence left with me copies of a Letter from him to H. Clay of 22. Jany 1833. and of one from him to R. B. Rhett of 16. Feby last—both protesting against the abandonment of the principle of protection to domestic industry. Mr Thompson son of judge Thompson comes with a budget of recommendations for the Office of Superintendant of the Armoury at Harper’s ferry. "

Leonard Adams is an inhabitant of this City about 65 years of age, originally from Massachusetts, but who has resided many years, here and raised by laborious industry a family of ten children, five of whom are yet living. He has been these two years working as a labourer at the Patent Office, and came now to ask my influence to obtain for him some place in one of the Departments as a watchman or Messenger— I might as well undertake by my influence to obtain for him the Office of Porter at the gate of Heaven— I looked into the massive Volumes of Correspondence, communicated to the British Parliament, and found several documents relating to the case of the Amistad, and large portions of the correspondence of Nicholas P. Trist— Much of the day wasted in this reading, with very little progress made. I went to the Department of State, and examined the correspondence between the late Secretary of State, and the U.S. District Attorney in Connecticut Holabird relating to the Amistad Africans. The Original draught of the order, of Martin Van Buren dated 7. Jany 1840. to the Marshal of the District of Connecticut, to deliver over to Lieutenant John S. Paine of the United States Navy, and aid in conveying on board the schooner Grampus, under his command all the negroes, late of the Spanish Schooner Amistad, in his custody, under process now pending before the circuit Court of the United States for the district of Connecticut, is annexed to the draught of a Letter from the Secretary of State to the Secretary of the Navy of 7. January 1840 published in Document 185— There is in the draught of the order, an interlineation erased, making it conditional on the event of the dismissal of the suit by the Courts, the date of 7. Jany 1840. is also erased—but no record of the correction made, after the return of the warrant by the District Attorney—nor any notice of the change in the volume of Records— The Letters from Holabird to Forsyth of 5, 9. and 21. Septr. 1839 are all garbled in Document 185— I asked Mr Webster if the President could not authorize a public vessel going to be stationed on the Coast of Africa to give a passage to all the liberated Africans— The District and Circuit Courts having so decreed, and the decree of the Supreme Court, though declaring them free—not Slaves, not Pirates, not Robbers, yet having taken from them the vessel found in their possession, indispensable to them for the accomplishment of their voyage home, and her cargo, their lawful prize of War, and which furnished them with ample means for their return to Africa— Mr Webster appeared at first startled at the idea, that the Amistad and her Cargo were the property of the Africans, but afterwards upon my urging the equity of sending them home, and its conformity to the policy of the Slave trade acts of Congress, he said he saw no objection to furnish them with a passage in a public ship, and would speak of it to morrow to the Secretary of the Navy.— I spent the Evening in answering Letters of invitation to deliver Addresses, Discourses and Lectures.

Swift is one of the numberless Office hunters, blockading the President’s house and all the executive Departments of the Government, famished for place.— He was the first of the Cadets educated at the public expence— Then an Officer of the Engineer Corps— Then, disturbed in his prospects of promotion by the admission of General Bernard into the Corps, and petted by Calhoun when Secretary of War, for his sycophancy, he resigned his Commission in the army in 1818 and was appointed surveyor of the Port of New-York, re-appointed by President Monroe; and superseded by me in Feby. 1827. when Peter Stagg, two months after Swift’s Commission had expired. Swift’s conduct had been in many respects questionable and he was involved in dark and suspicious money jobbing.— On the 15th. of the last Month I received a note from this person requesting me to inform Genl. Harrison that he was ready and willing to serve his Country in any suitable office— I took no notice of this—about a fortnight after this some friend of his took an opportunity in the Senate chamber to say to me that General Swift wanted a recommendation or certificate of good conduct or character from me, which I declined to give— Last evening I received a Letter from Mr Frye enclosing a written statement by General Swift, alledging that George Sullivan and Mr Sands had told him that I had said that if Swift could clear himself of the conspiracy trials he should not be disturbed in his office of surveyor; and as he was honourably acquitted upon the conspiracy trials, he has a right to expect a certificate from me, that the motive for omitting to renominate him was not in consequence of any participation by him in those transactions— The impudence of this thrice repeated call on me, to help him in this Office-beggary, almost ruffled my temper. My recollection of the reasons for not renominating him is quite indistinct; but my impression is that the principal reason was that which he wants me now to certify that it was not— I called at the Treasury Department and enquired for the correspondents relating to appointments in 1826. and 27. but was informed by the Chief Clerk M’Clintock Young that all those papers were destroyed in the fire of 1833.— I called on Mr Frye at his office and explained to him my inability to give the certificate desired, and my denial of his right to expect it— At the Navy Department The Secretary Mr Badger went off to North Carolina this morning—the Chief Clerk sick— I postpone my purpose to inspect documents. At the Postmaster General’s Office Recommended Dutton and Wentworth for a printing contract—and James Moorhead’s son, for Postmaster at Indiana, Pennsylvania— Thence to the Capitol where I applied at the Document Office for sundry papers which were furnished me— Walk home— Sudden change of weather from snow and frost to midsummer heat— Evening visit from Brigadier General Brady, and a Captain Howard; not I believe of the army.

The proclamation calling an extra Session of Congress, to meet on Monday the 31st. of May next, was issued on Saint Patrick’s day, last Wednesday the 17th. It alledges sundry important matters, chiefly relating to the condition of the finances of the Country, as the motives for the convocation— Since the close of the Session of the Senate last Monday, the removals from Office have commenced; and they are going on swimmingly.— Mr Lay was with me this morning about two hours.— He proposes to leave the city on Monday to return home. He says the whole New-York delegation have recommended him earnestly for the office of Chargé d’Affaires at Naples, but the appointment cannot be made before the Session of Congress, there being no appropriation for an outfit, and Mr Webster between the weight of recommendations in favour of Lay, and his extreme solicitude to conciliate the South, knows absolutely not what to do— And who should the South crowd upon him for the Neapolitan mission but Duff Green, who demands it in a tone so peremptory that it will brook no refusal, and who alledges a necessity for the office no less urgent than a sheriffs execution now bearing upon the furniture of his dwelling house requiring the application of an outfit to be removed— Mr Webster is not altogether reconciled to this bestowal of honour and profit upon Duff Green, but there is a pressure upon the gratitude, and perhaps upon the promises of the President— As yet the appointments have not been absolutely discreditable— Edward Curtis, after the long agony is Collector of the Customs at New-York; and Ogden Hoffman is District Attorney: Mr Lay said he had been offered as a substitute for the office of Chargé d’Affaires to Naples, the same Station at Brussels or at the Hague—and he asked me, which of them would be the most desirable— I said I thought Brussels would deserve the preference and that with the exception of the climate, either of them would be preferable to the bottom of the boot at Naples— Mr Lay delicately intimated to me again his wish that I would recommend him for the place at Naples, to President Harrison— I have a hard struggle to resist these applications from worthy and kind friends, for my influence to befriend them— But independent of the humiliation of asking favours, where I have no service to alledge, I have the intimate conviction that any recommendation from me would be sure to exclude the individual recommended from any appointment.— I rode to the Capitol; forgot the purpose for which I went, which was for Mr Leavitt, and walked home— Stephen Hull the self-styled suspicious Minster of Carlisle was here again this afternoon, till I was obliged to tell him I was engaged. Miss Cutts was likewise here and her brother Richard— I am still assorting my files of Letters, and declining invitations to deliver Lectures— "

Sunday.—  Fire in my chamber first intermitted this Season—  At the second Presbyterian Church, heard Mr Wood from Exodus 14.15. “And the Lord said unto Moses, wherefore criest thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.” This was a very rational, though not what I should call a very orthodox calvinistic discourse— It inculcated with energy the doctrine of efficacious works— It laid down in explicit terms, the absolute impotence of faith without corresponding action. It assumed unequivocally the position that faith does not consist in praying to God, for that which it is our duty to do ourselves— This Church has become heretical to the Presbyterian Creed; but it is dragging out a lingering and helpless existence. On this beautiful day, the very personification of Spring there were not 60 persons present— In the afternoon at St. John’s Church, I heard Mr Hawley read the service for the 4th. Sunday in Lent, and preach from Revelation 22.12. [“]And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” The preacher remarked how universally all men worked for reward which he illustrated by sundry specifications, but never bethought himself of the Slave— If he had thought of it, he would not have ventured to take the verse for a text— The courtly preacher never mentions hell to ears polite— Massillon sometimes preached to the conscience of Louis 14. but no minister of the word of God South of Mason and Dixon’s line, ventures to preach one word against Slavery— Not a few preach Slavery itself— Mr Hawley gave notice that from this time forth the afternoon service would commence at 4. O’Clock P.M— Miss Cutts was here in the evening— I am yet, and shall be I scarcely know how long absorbed in the drudgery of assorting filing and endorsing Letters which I have been receiving during the whole Session of Congress, and two thirds of which when received I had not even time to read— I am compelled to read them now and groan under the waste of time consumed upon such trash. There is not one in fifty of them worth the paper upon which it is written; and if I begin to read any thing else, daylight fades into twilight and twilight into darkness before I am aware that the day is gone and I have done nothing— I this day took up and made a minute of 8. folio pamphlet documents containing about 1300 pages of papers communicated to the British Parliament in 1839 and 40. relating to the Slave trade divided into Classes A. B. C. D. two sets of each. What can I do with them?— It is impossible to separate the discussion upon the African slave-trade, from the moral and political aspects of Slavery; and that is with us a forbidden topic— I apprehend this is the rock upon which the Harrison administration will drift and go to pieces; as it is the Quicksand upon which that of Van Buren was stranded— The tariff and the bank are but suckers from the root.

Fire renewed in my chamber  Mr Lee from Alexandria came with a message from Mr Hallowell to remind me of the engagement which I had some months since contracted to deliver a Lecture there in the course of the present Spring— I promised Mr Lee, unless something should occur to prevent me to dine with him to-morrow week, deliver the Lecture in the Evening, and lodge at his house that night— It will cost me two days, which I can ill afford, but I have made the promise and must abide by it. I took to the Commissioner of Pensions a Letter to him from a Mrs. Henricia Constable claiming an increase of pension, with sundry documents— I had received them with a Letter from Thomas Clark, Masonville Delaware County, New-York, the last New-Year’s day, and found them yesterday in the process of assorting my files.— I went to the Navy Department, and read the Instructions from the Secretary J. K. Paulding to Lieutt. John S. Payne commanding the Schooner Grampus; from 2d. to 20 January 1840—and the Letters from Lieutenant Payne to the Secretary, in answer to the Instructions;—of which there are 7. with sundry enclosures— Deeply interesting— I took minutes of their dates.— The Memorandum from the Department of State. 2. Jany. 1840. is not there— Nor any copy of the warrant from Martin van Buren to the Marshal of the District of Connecticut to deliver the Amistad Negroes to Lieutt John S. Payne— No copy of either was kept at the Department. I called at Mr T. B. Johnson’s with a copy of my Son’s report on the North-eastern boundary which I received last evening, addressed to Mr Johnson— Finding him at dinner, I left the pamphlet with him and promised to call again. At the Treasury Department Mr Ewing was not there— I visited the Postmaster General Granger, with whom I left applications from Moses Lord of Newburyport W. L. Bigelow of Springfield, Otsego Co. New-York—Joseph Low Concord, New Hampshire—and William Hammett of Bangor, Maine, for a Mail Agency for his Son, William Cushing Hammett— I found Mr Doty the Delegate from the Territory of Wiskonsan with Mr Granger who told me that the Governor of Virginia had resigned— Mr Jocelyn called here while I was out, and in the Evening again when I had a long conversation with him respecting the Amistad Africans— They are now discharged from prison and have been sent to be employed and instructed at Farmington, about 25 miles from New Haven. I advised that they should be sent home as soon as could be done with convenience and safety. John A. Bogan came for a petition from himself and other bricklayers, for which he will call again to-morrow morning. "

I received two days since a Letter from a Stranger advising me now to retire from the world, the only reason for my postponing which is that I cannot afford it. There is another which I should have much trouble to overcome, but which I would encounter— That is the vacuity of occupation, in which I could take an interest— More than 60 years of incessant active intercourse with the world has made political movement to me as much a necessary of life as atmospheric air— This is the weakness of my nature, which I have intellect enough left to perceive, but not energy to controul— And thus while a remnant of physical power is left me to write and speak, the world will retire from me before I shall retire from the world— Mr Bogan was here again this Morning to ask for his petition, which I had looked up, and had ready to give him. He asked if it could be presented at the extra Session of Congress— I said I could offer to present it; though I could not promise that the house would receive it. He desired me then to keep it, and I concluded to speak to the Secretary of the Treasury upon the whole subject of the employment of work men on the public buildings— But I was compelled to postpone my visits to the Departments of State and of the Treasury— Mr Abbott was here and I agreed with him to deliver a Lecture to-morrow evening, at Dr Laurie’s Church at 1/2 past 7—a tax that has become perfectly odious to me. He asked me if I should have any objection to their taking up a collection after the Lecture— I said no, provided it was understood that no part of it was to come to me— They want the money for contributions to their library— I went to the City Hall to enquire at the Registrar’s Office, for the registry of Drady Ann Whitlow a free mulatto woman who is living with us as Cook; but her name could not be found on the register— She has a mutilated certificate from Charles County Maryland, from which the name of the certifying clerk is torn off; and she is now liable to be taken up and sold every day of the year for want of papers. I went next to the Capitol, and enquired at the Office of the Secretary of the Senate for a Document written by Mr Leavitt and ordered by the Senate to be printed— Mr Leavitt had written to me requesting me to procure a copy, or copies of it for him— But it is not yet printed— At the Office of the Clerk of the House, I received two sheets of the journal drawing to the close of the Session— The sky cleared up towards evening and I walked round the President’s Square— The filing, assorting and answering my budget of Letters in arrear proceeds sluggishly absorbing precious time, and heaping Pelion upon Ossa for future struggles never to be successful— I received this Evening a long Letter from my Son, with much heraldry from a man named Grace, at the Havana— "

Wednesday  Elizabeth Pierce was here again this morning, and will come again— Then Mr Martindale heretofore, several years a member of Congress from the State of New-York. It was sometime before I recollected his name, and had forgotten, that as late as the 23d. Congress he was with me a member of the Committee of manufactures. Mr Fosdick was with him— Mr Mayer and Mr Proud of Baltimore followed with an invitation from the Mechanical Library Association at that place to deliver a Lecture there which I was obliged to decline— Mr Benedick came next. Heretofore 25 years a Baptist Minister at Pawtucket Rhode Island, now, and for the lastyears Postmaster at that place he is uncertain whether he will be retained or removed— A year ago he says there were petitions for his removal because he was thought too much of a whig— Now there are others because he is thought too much of a democrat— He has been with Heman Lincoln as a Baptist delegate to Virginia— They are to have a triennial general convocation; and are apprehensive of abolition dissensions: but he thinks they will compromise and say nothing about it. He gives a very unpromising account of the Columbian College debt, and little prospect of its speedy payment. I visited the Department of State and left with Mr Webster a Letter from Richard B. Jones, soliciting the appointment of Consul at Havana. I said I hoped it would be seriously considered of very great importance to the honour and reputation of this Country that the Consul to be appointed there should be proof against the temptations of connivance at the African Slave-trade— Mr Webster said he would speak to the President on the subject to-morrow— He directed his Son also to send an Instruction to the Marshal of the District of Connecticut to amend his return of the Amistad Africans, on the census as Slaves— I searched with Mr Derrick for the correspondence relating to the Acts of the Legislature of South-Carolina of 21. December 1822. against the admission of free coloured men into the State found only part of it— Postpone further search till to-morrow.— I found also the Letter from the Secretary of State Forsyth to N. P. Trist, then Consul at Havana of 6. Jany 1840. which was not sent— At half past 7. O’Clock this Evening I delivered at Dr Lawrie’s church my Lecture upon Faith— The house was crowded, but so dark that I could see not more than five or six persons in the front pews— On no previous occasion of discoursing have I ever witnessed so little interest taken in it by the auditory— Richard Cutts junr and his Sister came home and spent an hour with us after the Lecture.

Thursday—  Mr Albert Fitz, a young man from Boston, by his own account a most accomplished Clerk, came to me yesterday, a total stranger, and said he wanted an Office in any one of the Departments—and on a word—one single word from me to Mr Webster— He had a strong recommendatory Letter to Mr Robert C. Winthrop, and had relied very much upon his influence, but he was gone— He shewed me also a highly commendatory Letter from Mr Abbott Lawrence to the Postmaster General Granger, but wanted one word from me to Mr Webster, for he was a most accomplished clerk, and had supported his mother ever since he was 16 years of age. He seemed disposed to take no answer to his request that I would speak one word for him to Mr Webster— This morning Mr Van Zandt called to ask for an extract from my Lecture delivered last Evening; of which he spoke in flattering terms.— I told him it would be published and I would give him a copy of it— Dr Todsen called—admired my Lecture very much, and was quite anxious that I should say a word for him to Mr Webster.— Mr Franklin and Mr Leib, from Pennsylvania, Strangers, came to visit me. Mr Leib informed me that he was a candidate for the appointment of an Auditor in the Treasury Department— That he had rendered important service in the Harrison cause, and among other things had undergone a prosecution or suit at Law—the report of which was in the 9th. volume of Watts’s Pennsylvania Reports— Mr Matthew St. Clair Clark was his friend with the Secretary of the Treasury, and wanted to shew him this volume of Watts’s Reports— It was in the Congress Library, but could be taken out only by a note from member of Congress— And as there was no member from Pennsylvania here, Mr Leib requested a note from me. I took the book out, and delivered it to Mr Franklin— Mr Kavasales was also here, anxious for an answer from the Secretary of the Navy, who is gone to North-Carolina. Two young men by the name of Williams came for my influence to obtain a midshipman’s warrant for Clarendon Williams the youngest of them— I advised him to have his name entered on the register at the Navy Department— Mr Homer of Boston is here with a project for a Government printing establishment, and says Mr Webster has promised to take care of him— Mr Richardson came to enquire if I had received several recommendations of him as Consul at Havre— I had one. He said he had no wish that Mr Beasley (who I told him was an old friend of mine) should be removed— I went to the City hall upon a second vain search for the registry of Drady Ann Whitlow’s freepapers— I left in the Circuit Court room an answer to judge Cranch and a letter to him for my Son— I rode to the Capitol, and walked home— Walk with my wife after dinner— Judge what time I have had this day for any useful occupation— "

He has fine talents as a political writer, and has for twenty years been a political drudge— His pretensions always very high are never gratified— Perfectly good natured, and always satisfied with himself he has an obtrusiveness of manners which it is almost impossible to tolerate, and not less so to resist.— He wrote to me very earnestly to urge his claim to the appointment of U.S. district Attorney at New-York— Came here himself to obtain it—but finding it pledged to Ogden Hoffman, told me he would not accept it with the compensation reduced not to exceed 6000 dollars a year. I asked him if he came for something now. He said no but he would take if offered to him the appointment of Charge d’Affaires at Berlin or at Naples—though he might expect something better—he was surely not below Cambreleng. I called at the Treasury Department, and found the Secretary Ewing so oppressed with business that I could have with him only a very short conversation— I enquired into the present condition of the Smithson fund and shewed him my 3. Resolutions offered to the House on the 30th. of December last, and the Letter to me of Levi Woodbury of the 18th of January— Upon enquiry of Mr Maclintock Young it appeared that the interest of the last year on the Arkansas bonds was invested in Illinois Stocks at 79. Mr Ewing said he would call at my house to converse with me on this and other matters— I left with him applications for appointments of S. H. Currier as Collector of the Customs at Newburyport—of Seth Williams at Fall-river, formerly Dighton—of Leavitt Thaxter for Edgartown—of William Pearce as Collector and William Ferson as Deputy Collector at Gloucester—and he read at my request the petition of John A. Bogan and 5 bricklayers, whereupon I intreated him to reform the stupid and gross mismanagement of the whole concern respecting the public buildings.— He said it was under the consideration of the Cabinet— At the Department of State I communicated to Mr Webster the Letter from J. T. Buckingham, with the Resolutions of the Bunker-hill Association of the 16th. of January last; and I left with him applications for office of Balie Peyton as U.S. District Attorney at New-Orleans; of Burrington Anthony, to be continued Marshal of Rhode-Island—an of J. J. Greenough to be continued and promoted as a Clerk in the Patent Office— I found also the papers of which I was in quest relating to the Acts of the Legislature of South Carolina, excluding negroes from coming into the State by Sea; with additional and important papers on the same subject— I took the Letter from judge William Johnson to me of 3. July 1824. out with me; and read the opinions of the Attornies general, Wirt, Berrien and Taney; and the Correspondence between J. Forsyth and the French Minister Pontois. Evening visit to T. B. Johnson— Richard Cutts, junr and his Sister were here—and Mr Connell from Philadelphia. Beautiful Spring weather. "

                "text": "27. V. Saturday.  This Miss Pierce was twice here, and finally some needle work was found to give her employment— In the tedious process of assorting and filing the mass of Letters that I have received since the commencement of the present year, the frivolous character of nearly the whole of them presses itself upon my attention— The applications and solicitations for office are numerous— A class of correspondents from the burden of whose intimacy I had been for the last twelve years almost entirely relieved— They have now revived, without the revival of the power to gratify even one of them in a hundred. All the good office I can render in them is to submit the applications themselves to the respective heads of Departments— I took therefore this morning to the Post-master General Granger, a copy of a Letter from Abraham Bradley of 16. Octr. 1829 to Joseph Low, removed from the Office of Postmaster at Concord New Hampshire, and who now applies to be restored— I had already left there the Letter of solicitation from Mr Low himself— A Letter from Gershom B. Weston of Duxbury recommending William Ellison, for Postmaster at that place—and a Letter from Sylvester Pendleton Clark applying for restoration to the Post-Office at Pendleton, in the State of New-York, whence he had been removed without alledged cause by the late Postmaster General, John M Niles, last October— I had another Letter from Daniel T. Hyde at Annapolis—urging the restoration of Grafton Munroe, removed from that Post-Office— This Mr Granger read, but I took it back, as he had other applications direct in behalf of Mr Munroe— Mr Peck from New-York, was with him, and at the door of Major Nourse’s Office I met James Monroe. I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer, to enquire for 50 copies of my Speech on the Treasury Note Bill— Neither Gales nor Seaton was there, but the foreman found the copies of my speech, which he will send to the capitol to be folded. At Mrs Peyton’s where I went to visit Mr Ogle, the Negroe man at the door told me that he was better, and was riding out— I walked round the President’s square at Evening twilight, and waded along nearly through N. P. Trist’s Dissertation Philippic addressed to the British Commissioners at the Havana in the form of a Letter dated 2. July–29. Augt. 1839—an elaborate, insolent, crafty, hypocritical treatise to sustain and justify the African Slave-trade and Negro Slavery under hollow professions of deep detestation of them both— This paper and the whole of Trist’s correspondence and his conduct as U.S. Consul at Havana, are among the most remarkable phenomena of the death struggle now in continual operation between the Spirit of Liberty and the Spirit of bondage on this Continent of North-America— Trist has the Ambition to act a prime part in this great convulsion.

Sunday  Germinating weather— Mr Thornton the Minister of the foundery methodist chapel preached this morning, at the second Presbyterian church, for Mr Wood— His text was from 1. John 2.1—[“]If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. 2. And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.” A regular calvinistic discourse of the old presbyterian school— Jesus is here an Advocate with the father; being himself the propitiation for the sins of the whole world— But if he is the advocate how can he be the judge? and if he is the judge how can he be the propitiation? The rigid calvinists consider the atonement by the death of the man Christ Jesus, as the vital part of Christianity, and that whoever disbelieves it is no Christian.— It is an example of what the human mind may be brought to believe as a creed in conflict with common sense— It is too absurd to bear one ray of the Sunbeam concentrated through the burning glass of reason— There is an atonement for sin by the blood of Christ, proclaimed in the New Covenant, and largely set forth in the Epistles of Paul. But it is not the calvinistic creed— Mr Thornton urged with great earnestness that repentance could of itself have any efficacy to obtain the pardon of sin— But what is sin? Lucretia Motte to convince me that nothing less than the immediate abolition of Slavery could satisfy her, said to me—why ’tis a Sin! Now if it be a Sin, has it been atoned for by the blood of Christ? and if it has been atoned for, what need is there either for the abolition of Slavery, or for repentance to take away the Sin? The most incomprehensible thing to me in the calvinistic atonement is how the crucifixion of Jesus more than 1800 years ago, could atone for all the sins of all mankind from that time forth till the end of the world— Mr Thornton said he had promised Mr Wood that he would see to his pulpit’s being supplied during his absence— And as Bishop Waugh would preach for him at the foundery chapel this morning, he had concluded to take Mr Wood’s place himself— After the service, walking home I witnessed a greeting between Mr Thornton, and Mr Penrose of Pennsylvania the new Solicitor of the Treasury.— They had been old acquaintance at Carlisle— After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley read the Evening prayer for the 5th. Sunday in Lent, and preached from Job 31.14. “What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?” Well was it for Mr Hawley that with this verse he did not take the one immediately before and the one immediately after it. Mr John Connell was here this evening, much improved in Spirits; but he says the President is in great perplexity about the appointment of a Collector of the Customs at Philadelphia— The President has been yesterday and this day confined to his bed with a vernal chill— I received this evening a Letter from Mr Lewis Tappan of New-York and another from Messrs. Jocelyn, Leavitt and Tappan the Committee for the Amistad captives, which furnishes matter for much deliberation, and deliberate meditation for me. "

Monday  Rain the greater part of the last night, and of this day, with a chilling east wind requiring a small fire in my chamber, just enough to be kept burning— Mr. Munroe was a stranger from Boston, who brought a parcel for Elizabeth. I completed the assortment and filing of my Letters received since the beginning of this year, and find myself with a task before me perfectly appalling— I am yet to revise for publication my argument in the case of the Amistad Africans, and in merely glancing over the Parliamentary Slave-trade papers lent me by Mr Fox, I find impulses of duty upon my own conscience, which I cannot resist, while on the other hand, the magnitude, the danger, the insurmountable burden of labour to be encountered in the undertaking to touch upon the Slave-trade— No one else will undertake it— No one but a Spirit unconquerable by Man Woman or Fiend, can undertake it, but with the heart of Martyrdom— The world, the flesh, and all the devils in hell are arrayed against any man, who now, in this North-American Union, shall dare to join the standard of Almighty God, to put down the African Slave-trade—and what can I, upon the verge of my seventy-fourth birth-day, with a shaking hand, a darkening eye, a drowsy brain, and with all my faculties, dropping from me, one by one, as the teeth are dropping from my head, one by one, what can I do for the cause of God and Man? for the progress of human emancipation? for the suppression of the African Slave-trade?— Yet my conscience presses me on—let me but die upon the breach— I walked about half an hour for exercise before dinner, and called at the house of Mr S. H. Fox the British Minister, to have some conversation with him— It was 2. O’Clock P.M. The Servant at the door told me that he was not up, and that he was unwell. I enquired at what time he was usually visible—he said between 3. and 4. I had heard that his usual hour of rising was 3. In my second walk after dinner I met Mr Jesse D. Miller, first Auditor of the Treasury; from which Office it is said he is to retire at the close of the present month and quarter.— This evening I answered an old and repeated invitation to deliver a Lecture at Richmond Virginia; and postponed answering the Letters received last Evening from the Amistad Committee, and from Lewis Tappan— I read judge Betts’s opinion upon the 14th. Section of the Tariff-Act of July 1832—and the reversal of his decision by judge Thompson— And I made several minutes from the Parliamentary Slave trade papers Class A. 1839–40. shewing the enormous extent to which that trade was in those and the two preceding years, carried on in American vessels under the patronage of N. P. Trist. "

Mr Charles Gordon heretofore an important clerk in the General Land Office dismissed under the Jackson administration for the colour of his political coat, afterwards employed three several times by direction of the Senate, as a draughtsman to protract the lands surveys came to shew me a machine of his own invention for protracting surveys made by the chain and compass— His dismission according to his statement was one of the first steps to that Chaos of Confusion into which the whole management of the Office has fallen— The extent of which may be imagined from the necessity of an act of Congress actually passed at the recent Session to legalize the whole mass of the land Patents issued for several years.— Mr Gordon wants restoration to his place— Mr. Homer came to set forth his equitable claims to a clerkship in one of the Departments here, consisting 1. In his wants 2. In his misfortunes; having failed in business as publisher of a compound Newspaper in Boston 3. In the fact that there is not a single Bostonian in any of the subordinate public offices. His purpose is to be a Letter-writer for sundry Newspapers; for which a Clerkship will be a convenient location.

In his wants 2. In his misfortunes; having failed in business as publisher of a compound Newspaper in Boston 3.

Thursday—  Visitors absorbed at least two thirds of this day— First came Mr Oliver, a Senator from the County of Essex in the Legislature of Massachusetts, who brought me a Letter from Daniel C. Baker, corresponding Secretary pro tem, of the Lynn Union Lyceum inviting me to deliver a Lecture before that institution in the early part of next fall. I told Mr Oliver that it was very doubtful, whether I should not be necessarily detained here the whole of the next Fall; and in that uncertainty could not contract any engagement to deliver a Lecture any where— He said he had expected this answer. Mr Oliver spoke cautiously about the proceedings of the Massachusetts Legislature at their recent Session— He attributed all their movements to the Boston delegation, and seemed to be not altogether satisfied with them— He did not tell me what he came here for— Next was Mr Thomas Harrison; heretofore a Captain in the 9th. regiment of infantry, and who lost a leg in the last War with Great Britain. He was a candidate for the Office of Naval Officer at Boston, and wrote me a Letter requesting my influence in his favour— That office has however been given to Isaac P. Davis, and now Mr Harrison comes for the Office, taking it for granted that Coll. M’Neill a New-Hampshire man will be removed— Mr Cushing followed, with a Letter from the Revd. Charles W. Upham, concerning a claim of the Revd. Charles C. Sewall to a bequest by a man from Wurtemberg named Prescher of a portion of an inheritance, with enquiries how it may be recovered— I read to Mr Cushing the Letters that I had received from Mr Upham and Mr Sewall on this subject, with a translated Statement of proceedings at Ulm in opposition to this bequest— I supposed the Department of State might give some aid for the recovery of this property, and I offered the papers to Mr Cushing, to pursue that track but he declined to receive them— Mr Cushing said he proposed to go home next week for a week and then to return and remain here till the extra Session, but he professed to know nothing of the plans of the Administration. Mr Walley is a member of the Massachusetts Legislature, from Roxbury, and was a Candidate for the Office of U.S. Marshal, till it was given to Solomon Lincoln. He says he comes now to see about certain Post-Offices in the County of Norfolk, and was well satisfied with his success with Mr Granger.— Of his present personal views and expectations he did not speak— I called at the President’s house, where Doctors Miller, May, Hall and Worthington were in consultation upon his case a bilious pleurisy or typhoid pneumonia, very dangerous. Mr Chambers told me there had been no perceptible change in his condition within the last 24 hours. I called between 3 and 4. O’Clock at Mr Fox’s door, and the servant told me that he was not yet up— Afternoon walk— Met Coll. James Thomas— Evening visit from Mr Whittlesey who introduced his nephew of the same name. "

He was seized last Saturday with a severe chill; and the next day with what his physicians called a bilious pleurisy; since that time he has been very ill, with symptoms varying from day to day and almost from hour to hour. The porter at the door answers all enquirers that he is better; while Mr Chambers and Mr Todd report that there is no change, and the physicians agree to answer all alike. Yesterday during the day time the answer was much better—last evening not so well—this morning, quite out of danger— I rode to the Capitol to enquire for the last sheets of the House Journal of the late Session of Congress, and for the documents relating to the Slave-trade, and N. P. Trist’s correspondence, neither of which is yet from the press. Returning home, I stop’d at Taylor’s Book-store and settled an old Bill—then at Mr Cushing’s lodgings, but he was abroad—then at Semmes’s wine-store but found a dry-goods store in its place— Then at the National Intelligencer Office, where I found Mr Seaton very much occupied— He had a note from Coll. Todd written at 9 this morning, informing him with extreme pleasure that the President was decidedly better; and a second note, between 12 and 1. that the 4. physicians, being then in consultation confirmed the previous report the remainder of the day frequent reports announced much improvement and rapid recovery till Evening, when unfavourable symptoms again recurred. Mrs Thornton, with Mrs Talbot her son and daughter spent the Evening here. My time slips away from under me week after week, while I am doing nothing. I was all this day absorbed in struggling to answer a Letter from Messrs Jocelyn, Leavitt and Lewis Tappan, about the Amistad Africans, whose case involves deeply perplexing questions yet to be discussed and adjusted—and I had this day a Letter from Mr Leavitt a Letter, mentioning that the printer was calling for my revised argument before the Supreme Court upon which I have not yet commenced— Upwards of two hours of my time was consumed in reading documents in the Parliamentary papers relating to the Slave trade; accumulating proofs of the duplicity of Spain and Portugal in their Treaties with Great-Britain and in their Edicts against the Slave-trade— With that same duplicity the Government of the United States stands heavily charged, and with such defences as Forsyth’s despatches and Trist’s Dissertations compared with the last paragraph of Van Buren’s last annual Message to Congress, an American must hide his head for shame— The consummation of the whole system of policy is disclosed in N. P. Trist’s Letter to the British Commissioners of 2. July and 29. August 1839. where the consummate impudence of Coll. Chartres, is combined with an equally shameless hypocrisy. "

Jocelyn, Joshua Leavitt and Lewis Tappan, declining a proposal made to me by them, to commence a correspondence with Lord Palmerston, respecting the case of the Amistad Africans. On full deliberation I concluded that it would be improper, and perhaps an infraction of the Act of Congress of 30. Jany 1799. This subject of Slavery is yet festering, and this morning’s National Intelligencer, contains the Letter of John M. Patton, acting Governor of Virginia, to William H. Seward, Governor of the State of New-York, announcing his readiness to deliver up a man charged with forgery in New-York arrested in Virginia, and whom the late Governor Gilmer had refused to deliver up at the requisition of Governor Seward. Also the Message from Governor Seward to the Legislature of New-York of 26 March. last which is firm, spirited and well-tempered— Hitherto the controversy has been much more ably managed by Seward, than by the Virginians, but there have been symptoms of the basest defection to the cause of Freedom among the New-York whigs, and a disposition to sacrifice Seward to the South which excite fearful misgivings of the result. I called this morning at the Treasury Department and there deposited 500 dollars in gold and silver for which I took 5. Treasury Notes of 100 dollars each of this date, payable in one year and bearing interest at 6 per Cent— I intend this as a re-investment of the money received from R. I. Morsell on account for the house, which I incautiously agreed to sell to him on the 28th. of March 1839. a bargain which I have no right to expect I shall live to see consummated— I saw the Secretary of the Treasury and left with him Letters fromDering claiming to be re-instated as Collector at the Port of Sag-harbour, and from Harvey Field, andGlover, craving the appointment of Inspector of the Customs, for Quincy, Milton and Dorchester, under Levi Lincoln, who is now Collector at Boston, in the place of George Bancroft resigned. He furnished me a statement of the present condition of the Smithson fund; now all invested in State Stocks enormously depreciated. He told me the President was better, and that was given out all the morning— I rode to the Capitol, spent an hour in the Library and walked home— Met Mr Cushing after calling at his lodgings— He said he proposed to leave the City next Tuesday to go home for a week or a fortnight and then return— Mrs Brooks and Mrs Dawes were here after dinner to see Elizabeth— Coll. Thomas in the Evening— Also Richard Cutts and his Sister, and Doctor Thomas.— The President’s illness returned shortly after noon with extreme violence— Expresses had already been sent to Baltimore for Dr Alexander who came and for Dr Chapman to Philadelphia; the reports from the house were more and more desponding the whole evening, and the physicians pronounced that he could not survive the Night.

At 30 minutes past midnight this morning of Palm-Sunday the 4th. of April 1841. died William Henry Harrison, precisely one calendar month as President of the United States, after his inauguration— The first impression of this event, here where it occurred is of the frailty of all human enjoyments, and the awful vicissitudes woven into the lot of mortal man— He had reached but one short month since the pinnacle of honour and power in his own country— He lies a lifeless corpse in the Palace provided by his Country for his abode. He was amiable and benevolent. Sympathy for his sufferings and his fate, is the prevailing sentiment of his fellow-citizens— The bereavement and distress of his family, is felt intensely, albeit they are strangers here, and known to scarcely any one— His wife had not yet even left his residence at North-bend, Ohio, to join him here. An express was sent for her two or three days since, but the tidings of death must meet her before she can reach this city. The influence of this event upon the condition and history of the Country, can scarcely be foreseen— It make the Vice-President of the United States, John Tyler of Virginia, acting President of the Union, for four years, less one Month— Tyler is a political sectarian of the Slave-driving, Virginian Jeffersonian school— Principled against all improvement— With all the interests and passions, and vices of Slavery rooted in his moral and political constitution—with talents not above mediocrity, and a spirit incapable of expansion to the dimensions of the station upon which he has been cast by the hand of Providence unseen through the apparent agency of chance— To that benign and healing hand of Providence I trust in humble hope of the good, which it always brings forth out of evil— In upwards of half a century, this is the first instance of a Vice-President’s being called to act as President of the United-States, and brings to the test that provision of the Constitution which places in the Executive Chair a man never thought of for it by any body.— This day was in every sense gloomy— Rain the whole day. I attended public worship first at the Presbyterian Church where there were less than 30 persons, and a stranger gave out two hymns, and made a short prayer. Mr Wood was to have reached home last Evening but did not— The Cars from Philadelphia having failed to arrive at Baltimore in time for the passengers to come on in those from Baltimore to this place last Evening. The Stranger said that he himself came from Philadelphia the day before yesterday, and from Baltimore last evening— That he was too unwell to preach this morning but that he would preach at half past 3 this afternoon. The Congregation was then dismissed and I went to St. John’s Church where Mr Hawley was reading the morning prayer for the Sunday before Easter. He preached from Psalm 39.5—“Veryly, every man at his best state is altogether vanity.” He said he had witnessed the death of the chief magistrate, after prayers at his bed-side at 9 last Evening.— Mrs Brooks widow of the late Governor Brooks’s son dined with us.

A hand bill was circulated yesterday, and published in the National Intelligencer this morning, signed Daniel Webster Secretary of State, Thomas Ewing, Secretary of the Treasury, John Bell, Secretary of War, John J. Crittenden, Attorney General, and Francis Granger Postmaster General, announcing the decease of William Henry Harrison President of the United States— Another Letter is published signed by the same persons, addressed to John Tyler Vice-President of the United States, to inform him of the sad event, immediately after which it was despatched by Fletcher Webster, Chief Clerk of the Department of State— The Secretary of the Navy, Charles Badger is absent in North-Carolina— A report of the attending and consulting physicians, addressed by Dr Thomas Miller, and signed by Frederick May. M.D. N. W. Worthington M.D. J. C Hall M.D. and Ashton Alexander M.D. stating very briefly the disease and its progress and termination— Then arrangements for the funeral on Wednesday the 7th. instt. at Noon; signed also by the five heads of Departments; by one of which I am invited by name, as Ex-President of the United-States to attend— (Orders from the War and Navy Departments follow—from the Mayor and Councils of the City—from Sundry Corporations, and Associations— And two communications from the Legislature of Maryland now in Session at Annapolis, to the Secretary of State, announcing their Resolution to attend the funeral in a body. These occurred in the course of this day). I had a morning visit from Mr Cushing, originally from Scituate and a distant relative of the heretofore judges William and Nathan Cushing—but many years an inhabitant of the District and State of Maine, and now a Citizen of Boston; concerned in some project of an establishment at Neponset Dorchester, connected with the projected railway, between Boston and Quincy— He told me that he was here only for a day or two, but did not tell me for what he came. The corpse of the late President Harrison was laid out in a plain coffin covered with black velvet, on a table in the middle of the entrance Hall at the President’s house— At 2 O’Clock P.M. I went with my wife and Mrs Smith, and took a last look at the face of the Patriot Warrior, taken away thus providentially from the evil to come. I then parted from the Ladies and called on Mr Caleb Cushing whom I found at his lodgings, dining in solitude. He has postponed his departure to visit his home till next week.— Conversing with him on various political topics, I found him doubting what will now be the principles of the administration substituted for that of General Harrison—and very reserved in the expression of his own opinions— Walk home— Late dinner— Mary Louisa unwell. Evening visit from Mr Hawley, who is in some perplexity with regard to the prayer in the Church service for the President of the United States. He read it yesterday morning; but some person this day questioned the propriety of it— He came to ask my opinion, which I gave him that it was not improper, but that some variation of expression might be proper— He will write to the Bishop of the Diocese.

                "text": "6. V:15 Tuesday  The arrangements for the funeral of the late President of the United States, William Henry Harrison, were published in this day’s National Intelligencer— The Vice-President John Tyler of Virginia, arrived here at 5. O’Clock this morning, and took lodgings at Brown’s Hotel. At Noon the heads of Departments waited upon him. He requested them all to continue in the Offices, and took the Official Oath of President of the United States, which was administered to him by William Cranch Chief Justice of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia— The judge certifies that although Mr Tyler deems himself qualified to perform the duties and exercise the powers and Office of President, on the death of President Harrison, without any other Oath than that which he had taken as Vice-President, yet as doubts might arise, and for greater caution he had taken and subscribed the present Oath— And may the blessing of Heaven upon this Nation attend and follow this providential revolution in its Government— For the present it is not joyous but grievous— The moral condition of this country is degenerating; and especially that part of its institutions, which is organized by the process of unceasing elections— The spirit of the age and country is to accumulate power in the hands of the multitude, to shorten terms of service in high public office; to multiply elections and diminish executive power—to weaken all agencies protective of property or repressive of crime—to abolish capital punishments, imprisonment for debt, and even the lien upon property of contracts—Slavery—Temperance, Land-jobbing, Bankruptcy, and sundry controversies with Great-Britain, constitute the materials for the History of John Tyler’s administration— But the improvement of the condition of man will form no part of his policy, and the improvement of his Country will be an object of his most inveterate and inflexible opposition— May the omnipotence of God overrule the depravity of man— Of human purpose or human energy I despair— Elizabeth Pierce was here this morning with another Letter of sturdy beggary from her sister Mrs Telfair— I rode to the Capitol, but the Library was closed and I walked home— All the public offices are closed and all the works upon the public buildings are suspended: there are consequently large numbers of idlers lounging about the Capitol yard, the Streets and avenues and the Hotels.— Coll. Thomas was here this afternoon, gossiping for upwards of an hour, but des orienté, with regard to the prospects of the renovated administration— Mary Cutts took tea and spent the Evening here— The infection of suspended labours and of idleness caught and subdued me— I undertook to assort and file my Letters received through the last year, and soon found myself entangled in a snarl inextricable—from this I fall back to the perusal of the Parliamentary papers on the Slave-trade and the wrangling Negotiation, between Great-Britain and Portugal.

Harrison President U.S.  This ceremony was performed in a decent and unostentatious manner, with proper religious solemnity, and with the simplicity congenial to our republican institutions— A quarter before 12. Noon I attended at the President’s House, where in the centre of the East room the Coffin covered with a black velvet pall was placed on a plain table, by the side and crosswise of which was another at which the Revd. Mr Hawley Rector of St John’s Church read the episcopal funeral service, with a very brief additional statement of two facts— The first that the day after General Harrison entered the President’s house, he walked out into the City, and purchased a Bible, and a prayer-book both of which were on the table, and were exhibited to the assembled auditory by the officiating divine, who said that it had been the daily practice of the late President, to commence the day by reading in that Bible— The other fact was that he had expressed his regret at not having joined in full communion with the Church, and that it was his intention to have done so; on the ensuing Easter day, next Sunday— After the reading of the Church service the order of procession was formed; Mr Carroll, the Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United States officiating as one of the Marshals—he called out in succession the Mayors of the three Cities of Washington, Georgetown and Alexandria: then the Clergy and the Physicians— Then eight Soldiers of the Marine Corps came in, and bore away the Coffin which was placed on a Car drawn by six white horses. Twenty-six pall bearers in white skarfs, one representing each State in the Union followed the corpse. Then the family and relatives of the late President— Then the acting President, and heads of Departments— Then the Ex-Presidents—that is, myself, with Messrs. Forsyth, Poinsett, Paulding, and Gilpin, heads of departments of the late Van-Buren Administration— After which came the judges of the Courts, Senators—Foreign Ministers, Legations and Commissioners, and then Members of the House of Representatives. Governors of States and Territories &c—all preceded by a numerous and diversified Military escort— Mr Semmes the Chief Clerk of the Navy Department rode with me in my Carriage— The Corps Diplomatique were in full costume, but Mr Fox the British Minister was not present, nor I believe any member of the British Legation— Vast crowds of people followed in the procession, and the Avenue from the Palace to the Capitol was equally thronged. The City Bells were tolled, and minute guns were fired from the western terrace of the Capitol— A floating multitude, male and female, of all ages and colours followed the procession, to the Navy Yard burying ground, where the corpse was deposited in the receiving vault; with some difficulty from the excessive crowd; but not the slightest disorder— On the return, only the military escort continued in procession. I took up a Mr William Brent, who had lost his Carriage and left him on Capitol Hill— I reached home at half past 4. and idled off the remainder of the day. "

Mr Kavasales came this morning to enquire about the prospects of his appointment as a chaplain in the squadron now about to be despatched to the Mediterranean—but the Secretary of the Navy is yet absent, and I suppose no decision with regard to this appointment will be made till after his return— I promised however to see and speak with Mr Semmes the Chief Clerk of the Department, on the subject, and also with Commodore Morris, who Mr Kavasales says is going out as Commander of the Squadron—a Mrs Burrows was here to enquire if Mrs. Adams had any sewing to do, or if we wanted a daily supply of milk— Mr William Emmons, a Teazer came with his subscription book, for a republication of the trial of the Soldiers for the Boston Massacre of the 5th. of March 1770. He says he published the Edition of 1822 at the instigation of my father and of President Quincy, and he has now been a year and a half teazing me for aid to publish another edition of it— He has also made application for aid, to President Quincy, from whom I have an unanswered Letter concerning it— Emmons is now going to Boston; and his most urgent want was of 3 or 4 dollars to help him on his way— I subscribed for two copies of his book, and paid him for them two dollars a copy in advance, having little expectation of ever seeing them, but willing to get rid of the sight of him hereafter at that price. Mr Hodgson was also here— He thinks Mr Webster will dismiss Mr Greenhow from the office of translating Clerk in the Department of State, and he wishes to re-occupy that place which he sometime held himself. But he fears that Mr Webster will prefer to send him back to Constantinople as Dragoman, and that in that event Commodore Porter, will either kill him, or in some way accomplish his ruin— He wants me to intercede with Mr Webster, to restore to him his place as translator— I rode to the Capitol, and returned to the library, the American Almanac for 1841. but neither House Journal nor Slave-trade document was to be found at the Clerk’s Office and I walked home— At Sunset I took another walk, and in the Evening answered an old invitation, to deliver a Lecture before the Mechanics Society at Lancaster Pennsylvania, which I declined— I continued but could not finish a Letter to my Son, and it seems to me, as if I never before wasted so much time in idleness, with such a burden of work before me to do— The Parliamentary Documents relating to the Slave-trade absorb not only my time, but my faculties, and all to no profitable purpose.

Friday  Mrs Barney came this morning, and requested of me a Letter to Mr Tyler, recommending her Son, for the appointment of Surveyor of the Customs at Baltimore the place which her husband held by my appointment, and from which he was removed by President Jackson. Mrs Barney thinks this a substantial title to her Son to be restored to the Office, and she could not comprehend the scruple of propriety upon which I declined to furnish a Letter in his behalf— It is so distressing to refuse a favour to a woman, that I am almost out of humour with myself for adhering to principle. Dr Mayo came to ask again for his interrogatories, upon which my deposition was taken before the mayor, last February. The Doctor’s action against Blair and Rives for a libel, charging him with having purloined President Jackson’s Letter has been non suited upon demurrer; the Circuit Court of the District having decided that the word was not actionable— The Doctor has repeatedly applied to me for these interrogatories, which I had mislaid, but which upon overhauling my papers I had found and now returned to him.— He promised to send me a copy of them but I do not expect he will— Mr Samuel N Miller is a young man originally he says of Milton hill; but now and for several years past commorant in Nantucket and a sea-faring man. He applied three or four years since for a Commission as Lieutenant of a Revenue Cutter, with very strong recommendations and his Commission was already made out; when a Letter of remonstrance from Dutee J. Pearce to Levi Woodbury, threw him all aback and his Commission was with held. He shewed me Pearce’s Letter— The objection was that Pearce had rejoiced at the defeat of the democrats when Peace lost his election— Mr Miller proposes now to renew his application, and I told him I would mention his case to the Secretary of the Treasury— I went to the Navy Department and left with Mr Semmes the Chief Clerk, two Letters from Josiah Butler of Deerfield New-Hampshire applying for the Office of Naval Store keeper at Portsmouth— One from J. T. Williams, Washington, soliciting a Midshipman’s warrant for his brother Clarendon Williams— One from John Prince H.R. Boston—for the Office of Navy Agent Boston—and one from T. O. Brackett Boston asking either for the Office of Steward of Chelsea hospital or for that of Naval Store keeper Charlestown— I mentioned also the application of Mr Kavasales of which I had spoken to Mr Badger the Secretary.— Mr Semmes said he would probably be here next Monday. I had promised to speak also to Commodore Morris who is going out in Command of the Mediterranean squadron, but Mr Semmes said he was absent, at Boston. I took walks of half an hour of exercise before dinner and at Sunset. The Ladies went to Church— Mr Connell and Mr Greenough here this Evening. "

Confined almost entirely to the house by the weather, and occupied with fruitless researches, and endless endeavours to file and assort Letters and papers while the heart knoweth its own bitterness— Mr Kavasales came to enquire if there was an answer to his application for an appointment as Chaplain in the Mediterranean Squadron— I told him that I had renewed the application in his behalf at the Navy Department; but that the Secretary and Commodore Morris were both absent, and till their return no answer could be obtained— He said he was going to Alexandria to preach to-morrow for the methodist episcopal minister there, Mr Lipscomb.— Dr Mayo came, and gave me a copy of the Interrogatories which he had taken yesterday— He said his counsel had moved, and would argue a reconsideration by the Circuit Court of their decision, that the words charged in his libel suit against Blair and Rives were not actionable, and that if the Court should refuse the reconsideration, he should carry the case by appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court— He gave me also, two of his pamphlets, recently published—“Fragments of Jacksonism[”] and “a Word in Season.” or [“]Review of the Political Life and Opinions of Martin Van Buren.”— Before dinner I went to the Department of State, but the Secretary Webster was absent, in Conference with President Tyler— I saw his son, and chief Clerk Fletcher Webster, and returned to him the Letter from the late judge William Johnson to me of 3. July 1824—but neither the missing enclosure, of the Charleston Mercury of 23. June 1824. Nor the Letter from Mr Poinsett to me referred to in the Judge’s Letter could be found at the Department— I left also with the Chief Clerk, the Letters from Revd. C. C. Sewall and C. W. Upham of 1 and 4 Feby last, with the statement from Ulm, desiring him to request his father to read them and determine whether any Minister or Consul of the United States in Germany could be instructed to assist in obtaining the recognition and satisfaction of the bequest to Mr Sewall— Also the Letters of Application for Office, of Robert Treat Paine of 27. January last to be a Secretary of Legation, with a view to the pursuit of Astronomical researches— Of Alexander M’Intire of 24. March last, for employment in the Patent Office of George W. Beale jr of 28 Feby last, for employment in the U.S. consulate at Havana, and of Nathl Curtis of 1. Feby last in behalf of Samuel C. Greele.— I made some enquiries about the appointment of a Consul at Havana, and the Executive investigations of the conduct of the last Consul Nicholas P. Trist, which Mr Fletcher Webster was not prepared to answer, and appeared not much pleased to hear made. He said there had been no time to do any thing— Returning home I met Mr Penrose who spoke of the fifth annual Report of the Geological exploration of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by H. D. Rogers, of which he afterwards sent me a copy. "

Morning service at the second Presbyterian Church; all but empty— Mr Wood preached from Isaiah 59.9. “We wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.”— He began with a historical narrative of the condition of the kingdom of Judah, at the time when this prophesy was delivered—and indeed it was a melancholy time— It is difficult to present a parallel between any portion of the history of the Jews and our own history, in which there is any resemblance— With the exception of the reign of Solomon, a bright spot of 40 years yet of oriental despotism, the history of the children of Israel, is one tissue of calamity and crime, from the Exodus out of Egypt till Ephraim was swallowed up by the Assyrian and Judah by the Babylonian Monarchy— The writings of all the prophets and especially of Isaiah are but the records of cause and effect— The atrocious crimes of the kings and people and the severe judgments of Heaven. Mr Wood however called the attention of his hearers to a parallel line of transgressions and of punishments as having marked the history of our last ten years— He specified the Cholera of 1832. the great fire at New-York—the Tornado at Natchez and the compound calamities of Mobile all of which together scarcely amount to a pin-scratch in comparison with the disasters of the Jews in the days of Isaiah. Mr Wood mentioned also the disorders of the currency and pecuniary embarrassments of the Country, and lastly to cap the whole the sudden and astounding decease of President William Henry Harrison within a month, a little month after his inauguration.— Upon this event he made many very sensible observations and added many appropriate notices of his life and character. It was a very creditable funeral discourse; concluding with an earnest call upon the auditory to turn away from their own sins among which he denounced in bold language the practice of dueling; and to make their peace with God— He gave out the first and last 3. verses of Watts’s 67th. Psalm to be sung.— I had received an invitation from Messrs. George Gilliss andHand, elders of the seceding 2d. Presbyterian church, to attend a funeral Sermon by the Revd Mr Van Rensselaer (son of the Patroon) their Pastor, at Dr. Laurie’s Church at half past 3. this afternoon. I went accordingly with my wife, and heard the Discourse from 1. Peter 1.24. [“]For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: 25. But the word of the Lord endureth forever.” A long and eloquent funeral eulogy; contrasting the transient nature of the highest human excellence, with the eternal duration of the word of God.— As a panegyric it was skilfully composed and the account of the life of General Harrison was more copious of incident than I had known of before— A President of the United States chosen by a large majority of the People, cannot be an ordinary man. The house was crowded. President Tyler, the Secretary of the Treasury Ewing, and the Post-master General Granger were there. R. Cutts junr was here this Evening. "

                "text": "12. V:30. Monday.  On rising this morning I found the roofs of the opposite houses covered with snow, and it continued to snow all the morning; but melted as it fell— It confined me to the house until the evening twilight, when I walked to the foot of the Capitol Hill and back for exercise— I wasted hours upon the parliamentary papers relating to the Slave-trade, and then hours upon a genealogical treatise by James A Grace, and a Letter from him to John Heard dated Havana 9 Jany 1841. about my mother’s published Letters, and about the families of Quincy, Adams and Grace or Legras— My poem of Dermot Macmorrogh and Henry Middleton of South-Carolina. All these things make such a jumble of matter that it swallowed up the day, and left my letter to my Son yet unfinished— Mr Connell called this afternoon disappointed and desponding— He has been applying for the Office of Surveyor of the port of Philadelphia; his last resource after repeated failures of numerous speculations.— He said there had been this morning a cabinet meeting, and the three offices of the Philadelphia Custom house had been finally fixed; he knew not upon whom; but neither of them upon him— They would put him off with some inferior Office which he should not accept— The explosion of the Pennsylvania Bank of the United States has at length taken place and exhibits the conduct of Nicholas Biddle, Thomas Biddle, Jaudon, Cowperthwait, and Andrews, as steeped in the vilest corruption— Three-fifths at least of the Capital stock of the Bank is sunk and lost to the Stockholders forever— Enormous sums of it have been embezzled by each of those men, in a manner to shake all faith in human integrity— The report of a Committee of investigation was read at a public meeting of the Stock holders last Thursday, which broke up in a tumult, and another meeting is to be held next Thursday— Connell says that John M. Clayton of Delaware went there and attempted to defend N. Biddle but was hissed down and left the Meeting in disgust— Connell at two distant periods of time has served three successive years as a director of the Bank—the last of which was as late as the last year— I have always believed him a rigidly honest man; but he gave me time after time statements of the condition of the bank, flattering in the highest degree— He now tells me that he never owned any of the Stock— That shares had been transferred to him, to enable him to be chosen as a director; and that he never had any knowledge of the real condition of the bank: He says Nicholas Biddle has published in the National Gazette of last Saturday, a preliminary Article in defence of himself, and promises another— Alas! he is irretrievably ruined, in fortune and in fame— I doubt if his person is safe in Philadelphia.

                "text": "13. V:30. Tuesday  Mr Dickinson called on me this morning, and introduced himself to me, by presenting a Letter dated at Albany the first of this month, from the Governor of New-York William H. Seward to the late President Harrison, recommending Mr Dickinson as a man of plain speech but of great intelligence and of weighty influence as a member of the Senate of New-York. Mr Dickinson did not arrive here till after the death of General Harrison, and had not seen either the new President Tyler, or any of the heads of Departments— The Legislature of New-York are still in Session, and will continue so, Mr Dickinson thinks till the latter end of May. That in the midst of the Session this Gentleman should come away from Albany with such a Letter from the Governor of the State to the President, suggested naturally to me conjectures that his visit here was upon a political mission, to ascertain the purposes of this administration upon important points of policy, and to concert a corresponding system of action for the Legislature of New-York— Mr Dickinson did not tell me that he was thus deputed, but he manifested great anxiety to know, what were the intentions and the expectations of the administration with regard to a national Bank, a Tariff and the distribution among the States of the proceeds of the public Lands— I told him I knew nothing more upon these subjects than was to be gathered from the Newspapers, and advised him to see the President and the Secretaries. I said there was another subject which I deemed of more vital importance to this Union, than the Bank, the Tariff, the Currency, or the Land and State debts questions, or than all of them together—and that was the controversy between the States of New-York and Virginia, and the Slavery question generally; about which not one word was said by Mr Tyler in his Address, to the people of the United States intended for an inaugural exposition of his principles of Administration— He said he thought as I did with regard to the importance of the question between New-York and Virginia— I enquired if the People of New-York would sustain Governor Seward in the stand he had taken— He said certainly.—and that there was but one weighty member of the Senate opposed to it, or doubtful of it— Gulian C. Verplanck.— I suppose Verplanck to be the ablest man in that Senate, but the nerve is not in him— He is of the class of men, whose last resort always is to compromise with principle— I had visits also from Mr Thomas Harrison, with a Mr Lloyd, originally from Worcester County Massachusetts, but now settled at Cleveland Ohio—apparently a very intelligent man but of slender Constitution and infirm health— I walked before dinner nearly to Georgetown and at Evening twilight round the Capitol hill— Miss Cutts dined and spent the Evening with us, and her brother Richard was here in the Evening— I could not get through my Letter of commentary upon Grace.

The Snow has disappeared; but the chilly weather and cold April showers, with the peach and cherry trees in blossom blasted in the open bud— Elizabeth Pierce was here with three of the seven shirts which she is making for me, but I did not see her— I walked half an hour before dinner towards Georgetown, and round the Capitol hill at Sunset— Finished and despatched my Letter upon endless genealogies to my Son, and answered a Letter and Resolutions of the coloured People residing at Columbus in the State of Ohio. I have a Letter also from W. H. Seward Governor of the State of New-York, which though short I must answer, whatever responsibility may follow— But all this absorbs time which ought to be otherwise employed— Mr Kavasales was again here anxious for the decision upon his application for the chaplaincy; but Mr Badger the Secretary of the Navy has not yet returned— Mr Poinsett called also upon me, and now fully disclosed his project which is to place the investment and disposal of the Smithsonian funds under the management of the American Institution for the promotion of Literature and Science.— He concurs entirely in my views of confining the appropriations to the annual interest, leaving the principal unimpaired, and of making the first appropriations for the establishment of an Astronomical Observatory.— But he did not approve of leaving the selection of the spot to the secretary of the Treasury, and thought the hill opposite Analostan Island objectionable on account of its exposure to fogs, from its proximity to the river— He spoke of two or three other places between Meridian hill, and the President’s house with some remarks on each spot worthy of consideration— He said he had at present no other occupation on hand, and would be willing to devote two years, entirely to organizing this establishment, and getting it into full operation. I know not that it could be accomplished more effectively; and think I must acquiesce in this arrangement and endeavour to carry it through— The chief obstacle however will now be to extricate the funds from the fangs of the State of Arkansas. Mr Poinsett thought that they paid the interest upon their bonds punctually; but the Law requires that the interest should when paid be immediately reinvested in State Stocks, and I struggled in vain at the late Session of Congress to obtain a repeal of that Law.— Mr Poinsett said he was now going in a very few days to South-Carolina, but should soon return here. I received a Letter from Mr Joshua Leavitt with slips from Newspapers embracing the whole of my speech before the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the Amistad captives— I cannot longer delay to undertake the revisal of it, unless I abandon it altogether.

I finished my Letter to the Governor of New-York, which I marked private, but wrote with a constant anticipation, that it may be published very soon; and in all probability will be sooner or later.— I have laid down the principle, of international Law, upon which I concur with him in his controversy with the executive authorities of Virginia. I take what I believe to be the impregnable position, the right of each Sovereign party to a contract to construe its provisions for itself, but not to impose its construction upon the other— I have not touched upon the policy of impolicy of delivering up fugitives from Justice—nor upon the usages among civilized Nations, nor upon the degree of transgression embraced in the definition of the word crime.— Upon all these points there is much debatable ground— But the independent right of construction on both sides, the necessity that both parties should understand the words constituting obligation in a compact, in the same sense, and the basement story of the controversy the conflict between Freedom and Slavery are parts or auxiliaries of Seward’s argument which cannot be shaken. Prudence has warned me to stand aloof from this contest, but I cannot— The leading men of the North are all truckling to Southern Slavery— They are all ready to desert Seward in the stand that he has taken. I see what it will cost me to stand by him; but I have so little political capital left, that the remnant is not worth saving— Especially at the cost of base desertion from the cause.— Coll. Thomas was here this morning; and gave me a sample of the way in which Webster is doing business— Thomas is an applicant for the Office of Navy Agent here— The Office is at the disposal of the Secretary of the Navy, Badger— But Thomas wanted a good word or two from Webster to Mr Badger supposed to be under special obligation to Webster for his place— So Thomas obtains Letters from George Evans and Curtis to Webster, warmly recommendatory of Thomas, as a most useful political friend, strictly confidential, for Webster’s eye alone and utterly unfit to go into other hands— After several ineffectual calls to see Webster, always engaged, Thomas writes him a Letter, soliciting his influence with Badger, and enclosing the Letters from Evans and Curtis to Webster himself— Two days after Thomas calls again upon Webster, still engaged with company, who gives him back his Letter of solicitation, with the two enclosures from Evans and Curtis; and advises him to deliver them all to the Secretary of the Navy—Thomas says it is plain that Webster had not read them; for if he had he would never have suffered them to go out of his hands— Thomas called upon him again early this morning but found Cushing watching for him at his door.— He was going to try to find him again— Morning visit from Mr Stephen White; and one to Mrs Smith from Mrs Macomb. An hours walk before dinner, and round the Capitol hill at evening twilight. Call at Gadsby’s to visit Mr Dickinson but he was out— Met Mr Hodgson who walked home with me. Evening occupied— "

Mr Robert Reeves is a day watchman at the Treasury Department: a native of Ireland, who boasts that he never went to school a day in his life; and who brought for my perusal a well written manuscript of about 100 pages, containing a plan for a bank, a protecting Tariff, and a National currency and system of exchanges, original, altogether his own, and far superior to any thing ever proposed by any-one else— In this opinion he is perfectly sincere, and although conscious of the lowliness of his condition, and of the conclusion that other men may draw from this circumstance against his plan, it is to him only a source of higher self admiration, in the comparison between the greatness of his achievements and the smallness of his means— He had communicated his manuscript to the late President Van Buren who had read it, and conversed with him concerning it; but he was so taken with the sub treasury that he could approve of nothing else— I paid a visit this morning to Mr Tyler who styles himself President of the United States and not Vice-President acting as President which would be the correct style— But it is a construction of the Constitution, in direct violation both of the grammar, and context of the Constitution, which confers upon the Vice-President on the decease of the President, not the Office, but the powers and the duties of the said office— There is a dogmatical article in the National Intelligencer, asserting this false construction, which is not worth contesting, but which to a strict constructionist would warrant more than a doubt whether the Vice President has the right to occupy the President’s house or to claim his Salary without an act of Congress.— He moved into the house, two days ago, and received me in the old South-east Cabinet chamber.— He received me very kindly, and apologized for not having visited me without waiting for this call— To this I had no claim or pretension My visit was very short, as there were several persons in attendance and among them Mr Southard now President of the Senate— I then called at the Navy Department, where I found Mr Badger the Secretary, returned from North Carolina, and renewed the recommendation of Mr Kavasales for a chaplaincy in the Mediterranean squadron. Then on Stephen Pleasonton, 5th. Auditor, with a Letter from Philander Shaw, against the removal of Isaac Dunham as Light-house keeper at Nausett Point Eastham, which Mr Pleasonton enclosed with a strong recommendation of Dunham, which I took to the Secretary of the Treasury, who said it might perhaps save him— I left with him also a Letter from James Smith junr applying for the Office of Surveyor at Portsmouth New Hampshire, and one from John Otis in favour of Henry Crocker at Barnstable— Long Evening visit from Coll. James Thomas. "

I should have mentioned that yesterday morning I visited Mr Poinsett and took leave of him previous to his departure for Charleston South Carolina— I enquired when he proposed to return here, and understood him to say not till next Winter—but then he comes for two years to preside over the National Institution for the promotion of Science; and as he expressed a wish that the Smithsonian fund might be connected with that Institution and placed under its management, I requested him to take the Bill reported to the house with my Report of 5. March 1840, and prepare any amendment to it, which would carry out his views, and send it to me, before the approaching Session of Congress, which he said he would do— And in the afternoon, with my wife I visited Mr and Mrs Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, and thanked the Lady for a lithographic print likeness of her father the late Mr Dickinson of Troy, recently deceased; which print she sent me last week. They have two little girls who speak nothing but French—taught by a French Nursery Maid according to the Russian fashion— This morning I was visited by Mr Henry Williams of Boston, and Mr Etheridge of Charlestown— The latter had visited me some weeks since; though his name was omitted from the margin by inadvertence— He had also spoken to me of some claim last November when I delivered the Lecture at Charlestown and met him there— Mr Williams comes to apply for the Office of Surveyor of the Port of Boston, for which he thinks he has special qualifications and aptitudes— He made himself very conspicuous the Summer before last, by his opposition to the 15 gallon Law, against which he got up and edited a temporary newspaper, and wrote to me for my opinion, and published my answer—of which he reminded me now. Mr Kavasales came again to know his chance of success for a chaplaincy— I told him I had seen and spoken to the Secretary of the Navy, who had promised a speedy answer— He goes again to Alexandria, to preach there to-morrow— I called at the War Department, and left with Mr Bell, Letters of application, for Office from Henry Hunt Snelling, New-York, for a place in the West—from J. M. Allen Philadelphia for an Office of Assistant Surgeon in the Army—from John Franklin Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, for an Indian Agency—from Caspar W. Weaver near Hagerstown for the appointment of Paymaster at Harper’s Ferry—from John Maul for a Commission in the Army, and from W. M. Nelson, Fort Lauderdale East-Florida, a Sergeant of Artillery: also for a Commission. I wished to have some conversation with Mr. Bell, but he was obliged to attend a cabinet meeting and promised to call on me at my house next Monday Evening at 7. O’Clock.— I went to the Capitol, and returned to the library of Congress all the books charged to me, which I had out except 3 that I am yet to find— I received from Mr Cutts the last sheets of the House Journal, and as much of the Senate Journal as has yet been printed—and a Senate Document upon the charges against Trist, the existence of which I did not before know— Evening call on T. B. Johnson. "

V: Sunday  I borrowed from the occupations of the week, the morning hours to finish a Letter to Thomas Ewing Secretary of the Treasury, concerning the Smithsonian fund, its investment and its application— It involves the condition of the Navy Pension fund, the State debts, the Public Lands, Indian Treaties and Trusts, and the whole system of administration of the finances, revenues, receipts and expenditures of the Nation— I present it only so far as concerns the Smithsonian fund, and projected institution— I attended public worship this morning at the Presbyterian Church, where Mr Reuben Post preached from Romans 5.8. [“]But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”— Mr Post was formerly Minister of a Church in this city and several years chaplain to the House of Representatives— About the 1st. of May 1829. he visited me, in my deep distress at Meridian hill; for which I feel grateful to him— He is now settled at Charleston South-Carolina— After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read prayers for the first Sunday after Easter, but read as the first Lesson the 13th. chapter of Hosea, which is the first morning lesson of next Sunday, instead of the 48th. chapter of Isaiah, the proper first lesson of this Evening— He preached from Colossians 1.18. “And he is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the first born from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence: 19. For it pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell.” The purpose of the discourse was to illustrate the glorious character of Jesus Christ, and the special application of all the Epistles of St. Paul to that purpose; the glorification of Jesus— But why is this human personification of the only one and true God, the vital principle of the Christian Religion? Is it philosophical? The Creator God of the Universe, a worm of the dust? a crucified Jew? a vassal of Herod, the Tetrarch vassal of Octavius and Tiberius Caesar? why must we believe this? Is it not because the humanization of God is necessary to the deification of man? This seems to be the argument of the 15th chapter of the 1st. Epistle to the Corinthians, which is the second lesson of this Evening. After Church, I went to Mr Frye’s and conversed with him concerning a Letter from Joseph B. Hinton of Raleigh, to purchase the Columbian Mills— Mrs. Frye could not leave the bedside of young Kuhn, who is dying of a consumption at their house— Thomas came for me with the Carriage. I returned home, and went with my wife and Elizabeth C. Adams at 1/2 past 7. to Trinity Church— Mr Stringfellow read the Evening service of the day—the 48th. chapter of Isaiah being the first lesson. Bishop Meade of Virginia, preached from John 5.40. “And ye will not come to me that ye might have life.” Tender, affectionate, expostulatory—colloquial and attractive— He had preached on the same text this morning till his voice failed him— While we were out Dr and Mrs Thomas, were here; and Mr Southard, troubled with Constitutional questions.

Monday  Dr Todsen came to urge his application for some office, under the Department of State, and to ingratiate himself with me, asked me if I could lend him my Letters on Silesia—which he said were so favourably noticed in the last Edition of the German Conversations Lexicon that he wished very much to see them— Dr Towle called and said that Mrs Towle had now sufficiently recovered her health to resume her plan of painting a gallery of Portraits, and wished to take that of the President; to whom he therefore requested me to give him a Letter of Introduction— This I declined upon my general rule, which he did not take amiss.— He asked to borrow Stewart’s last Portrait of my father, to which I consented— Another visit from Mr Thomas Harrison to remind me of his application for the appointment of surveyor of the Port of Boston. Mr Babcock lives at Marietta, Ohio, to which his father emigrated from Massachusetts, he came to see me from the sole motive of curiosity. Dr Mayo brought and read to me the answers to his interrogatories, of Mr Westcott Secretary of Florida, upon Dr. Mayo’s libel suit against Blair and Rives. The endorsement by President Jackson upon his confidential Letter of Decr. 1830 to W. Fulton the Secretary of the Territory of Arkansas was that a copy of the same Letters should be addressed to the Secretary of the Territory of Florida— Westcott answers that he never did receive such a Letter from President Jackson; but that he knew every thing about Houston’s project for liberating Texas from the tyranny of Mexico not only in 1830. but as early as 1829. was himself ardently favourable to it; urgently recommended to many of his friends to embark in it, as no small number of them whom he names actually did; and if President Jackson had written to him for information concerning it he could and cheerfully would have given him all that he could have desired— Mrs Elliot visited also here— I took my Letter and pamphlets relating to the Smithsonian fund to the Secretary of the Treasury, and left them with him; with an earnest request that he would lay the subject before the President— Next I went before the Postmaster General and left with him nine several Letters of applications for Post-Offices or Mail Agencies— Then to the Secretary of State with whom I conversed about the Rev’d Charles Sewells claim to a devise in Germany.— I mentioned to him the names and claims of Hodgson Homer, Todson, and Offley— Mr Bell spent the Evening with me, in a long conversation, upon political affairs— "

Tuesday  I delivered yesterday to the Postmaster General Granger, applications from Rodman Starkweather for the Post-Office at Buffalo, New-York, from Elihu Hobart for the Post-Office at Abington Massachusetts from Syms Gardner, removed from the Post-Office at Bowdoinham, Maine from Henry Phelps, removed by G. Granger from the Post-Office at Gloucester, Massachusetts, for restoration—from S. C. French, Bangor, Maine, for the appointment of Ebenezer French as Mail Agent for the New-England States. for Royal Clark removed from the Post Office, Palmyra for restoration to Bangor. from Thomas Melvill, Galena Illinois, to be Register of the Land Office or Postmaster—from Asahel Burrington removed from the Post-Office at Burke Vermont, for restoration—from Samuel W. Lord Effingham New-Hampshire, for the restoration of Isaac Lord, removed— I had one from Abner Bartlett, Medford for the restoration of Luther Angier—but Mr Granger told me that he had appointed Mr Angier, the very day that I had applied in his behalf before— In my conversation with Mr Bell last evening, I had reason to conclude, that the policy of Mr Tyler will look exclusively to his own election for the next four years term as President; and that of Webster will be to secure it for him. That Mr Clay will be left to fight his own battle with the Land Bill, without aid or support from the administration, and that between Tyler and Webster there will be a concert of mutual concession between the North and the South— Clay will soon be in unequivocal opposition, and the administration will waddle along, living from hand to mouth—for as to any great commanding and compact system, Webster is “a great baby” and Ewing is another— Of course, this Administration will be a failure, and a general bankruptcy is impending. This day my preparations for departure were so dawdling, and the weather so foul and threatening that I concluded not to start till Thursday. I called on Dr Todsen, and left with him the French translation of my Letters on Silesia—and borrowed the 1st. volume of the German Conversations Lexicon 8th. edition 1833. containing the Article on my name; about half a page.— I visited the rooms at the new Patent building containing the specimens of natural history received from the exploring expedition chiefly birds and shells.— They are under the charge of Dr King—as yet in great confusion. I left there two volumes upon shells which I had received several weeks since for the Institution. Thence I went to the Capitol to make enquiries concerning the origin of the investment of the Smithsonian fund in Arkansas and Michigan Stocks; but without success— French was not there, and the two books missing from the Congress Library have not been found— Kavasales was here again this morning; and I referred him to the Secretary of the Navy, whose decision upon his application I have not yet received.

That most anxious and painful operation of packing up for departure occupied me almost the whole of this day, and till late in the night—but I had found last evening an order from Josiah Adams junr. upon the Commissioner of Patents, for 20 dollars paid by Mr Adams on his application for a Patent for a bark cutter but the patent was denied, and the order was for repayment of the money. Mr Adams gave it to me last November before I came on and it had lain forgotten in my trunk till last evening when it was found— I took it to the Commissioner of Patents, and after some difficulty as to the wording of the order which was not made payable to me by name, he finally gave me an order upon Fowler for the payment of the cash— I gave Mr Ellsworth a receipt in the name of—Josiah Adams junr. and received the money at Fowler’s Exchange Office. Mr. Ellsworth shewed me the magnificent Hall in the new Patent Office where the models of Patents are to be deposited and arranged; a work which has already been commenced, but in which very little progress has yet been made. He said that a very extraordinary proportion of the patents came from the State of Massachusetts. He shewed me also several other chambers where collections are to be preserved—one especially for maps—where I saw two late splendid maps of England and Ireland—Geological— Thence I went to the Capitol and left orders with the Postmaster of the House, M’Cormick to forward Letters and Papers for me, till a week before the Meeting of Congress, to Boston. Mr Fletcher was there, but neither French nor Berry, so that I could not get sight of the Section of the West Point Academy appropriation Bill, which sunk one half the Smithsonian fund into Arkansas Bonds two months before it reached the mint— I have endeavoured in vain to trace that abominable fraud to its source.— I left word with Mr Fletcher that there was yet a volume of my Senate Bills, Resolutions &c missing— I found the Secretary of the Navy, Badger at his office after 3. O’Clock, and met Commodore Morris in the Anti-chamber— I spoke to them both, in behalf of Kavasales for the chaplaincy; Morris expressed doubts whether he would get the appoint, but promised all kindness to him if he should.— The Secretary whom I pressed for an answer said he believed no appointment would be made to the office before the Session of Congress: as the squadron could not be got ready to sail sooner. I then asked if I might be permitted to say to Mr Kavasales, that the President would then nominate him, whereupon, he desired me to ask Kavasales to call at the Department to morrow morning before 12. with a note from me—which I promised; and accordingly an introductory Letter to Mr Kavasales, who had called on me this morning and came again in the Evening— Coll. Thomas was also here for a moment this Evening with nothing new and Mr Cammack who paid me 15 dollars for rent of the small lot. I returned a small volume to Mr Force—and packed up till past 1. A.M— "

I left Mr Fischer yet asleep and visited the newspaper reading room for an hour without learning any thing of much importance. Breakfast at the common table at 8. and a visit from the new Collector of the customs Edward Curtis— He finds his place after all his labour to get it no bed of roses. He said he regretted his vote last year against my bill for suppressing frauds in the collection of the duties on impost, and that if some such Bill should not pass there would soon be no revenue collected— Mr Curtis boards at the Astor house and invited me to visit her at their chambers which I did— Mrs Curtis is a Lady of fashion, and curious of gossiping news from Washington— So we talked about Madame de Bodisco’s Son or daughter, and Mr Fox’s rumoured marriage with her Sister. I made enquiry for Mr Hacket, and saw him— I returned to him his manuscript observations upon Lear, which he had lent me at Washington— Wrote a Letter to my wife, and then visited Mr Lewis Tappan at his and his brother Arthur’s shop N. 122 Pearl Street— He spoke to me of the Amistad Africans now at Farmington, Connecticut, and was urgent in his solicitations that I would attend at their celebration proposed some day next Month, which I had already declined— I enquired for Mr Leavitt, but he resides on the Jersey side of the river and was not in the City.— I left for him the two pamphlets of Congressional documents containing the correspondence of Nicholas P. Trist—and Mr Tappan gave me a copper medalic image of Thomas Clarkson, with his History of the Abolition of the African Slave-trade by the British Parliament.— The West Indies in 1837. by Joseph Sturge and Thomas Harvey. Poems by a Slave in Cuba. Translated and published by Dr. Madden.— Slavery and the internal Slave-trade in the United States, and eight small English Anti-Slavery pamphlets.—all received from Joseph Sturge who is now here— Mr Tappan afterwards called on me at the Astor house, but I had no further opportunity of conversing with him; being then engaged with Governor William H. Seward who was accidentally down for three days from Albany, but with whom I had opportunity for conversation only for about half an hour while we dined— I visited Mr Robert G. Shaw and his four daughters only three days from Boston, and received a tedious and troublesome visit from William Jagger, much perplexed with his suit against some one for Slander.— On sitting down to table at dinner, I found opposite to me, the Revd. Joseph Pearce Cranch only two days from Quincy, but had no time for talk with him— From the dinner table taking leave of Mr Fischer and Governor Seward I was hurried on board the Steamer Mohegan, for Stonington, which at 5. O’Clock parted from the wharf with a Northeast storm, and the prospect of a tempestuous Night. "

                "text": "25. V:30. Sunday.  At the first Congregational Church, this morning Dr Nathanael L. Frothingham preached from Psalm 139.23. “Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:” I think I never in my life, heard a Sermon of purer morality, of more elevated piety, of more affecting exhortation, of deeper impression— It was upon the duty of regulating, controuling and directing the thoughts— The discourse began by noticing that the first verses of the Psalm attested that God had already searched the Psalmist and known him—and that the all-seeing eye of God perceives and knows the thoughts of men, even before they are formed.— He then examined and discussed the opinion extensively prevailing that thought is free and beyond our controul or responsibility. That thoughts cost nothing; and shewed by a strict analysis of their nature, influence and operations, how they may cost our integrity, our peace our reason, our existence here, our destiny hereafter—and urged the deep concernment to us all, of unremitting vigilance over them as they arise in our minds, and of holding them under the curb of a rigorous discipline— This doctrine truly Christian, is perhaps the crowning glory of Christian morality— The germ of it all may perhaps be found in the tenth Commandment of the Decalogue—thou shalt not covet— How far the exclusion of evil thoughts may be within our controul is not easily ascertained; but the most effective expedient to keep them out, is to occupy the mind unremittingly with good ones. Idleness is the most dangerous instigator of evil thoughts, and they who with good intentions have not inflexibility of principle for adherence to virtue should not leave themselves time to be wicked— There were in the pew three copies of another Sermon, called the Solemn Week, preached by Dr Frothingham on the recent Fast-day, the 8th. of this month, and printed at the request of his parishioners. After meeting I had a visit from Mr Peter C. Brooks junr— Dr Frothingham’s text this afternoon was from 1. Corinthians 1.31.—[“]He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”— As an illustration of this precept, he adverted to the passage of the prophet Jeremiah 9.23 and 24. where the same injunction is repeated with specific reference to the principal sources of earthly glory, wisdom and power and riches. This Sermon was perhaps as instructive as that of the morning in setting forth the vanity of all human possessions, a lesson which cannot be too often or too forcibly taught: but it was more of a common place character, and therefore not so deeply impressive— Nor was it exhortation to virtue of so exalted an atmosphere, or of so difficult attainment— No sacrifice of selfish passions or interest, is require for reverence to God, or for abstinence from vain glory: but the dominion over one’s own Spirit is an arduous, and self-crucifying operation to acquire. I spent this Evening with Mr Peter C. Brooks at his house— His Son Peter C. with his wife live with him— A brother of judge Story and his wife— Mr Richard D. Tucker and judge Lyman of Northampton were there. "

William Minot, Charles G. Loring and Samuel A. Elliot which called the present meeting, and to whom were now added four others John Amory Lowell, Benjamin A Gould, Dr Francis Parkman, and my Son Charles Francis Adams; to carry the Resolutions into Execution— The Meeting was held in the Circuit Court room and about 5 O’Clock adjourned without day— In the evening I went with Mrs Charles to the Tremont Theatre and saw Shakespear’s King Lear— The parts of Lear by Mr and Miss Vandenhoff. The play was acted as recently restored, ending with the death of Cordelia and of Lear. The performance was barely tolerable. We came home about 10, without waiting for the after piece. "

Tuesday  I had hoped in the short visit to my children during the interval between the last, and the approaching Session of Congress to pursue the most necessary occupations with which I am burthened with little interruption; but when I came to luxuriate in the Study of my Son, with his classical Library, I find myself every moment enticed away by the fragrance of one blossom after another, till the day has passed off and I have done nothing— The last weeks arrears of this journal are not yet redeemed; and this is the first day upon which I have been able to take up the report of my late Speech before the Supreme Court of the United States, for revisal; and I found immediately that I had left at Washington all the important Documents which I wanted for the revisal— The Committee of the Alumni, to whom my answer declining to deliver the first anniversary address the day before next Commencement was given by my Son, urged me to make a conditional promise that I would deliver it, if I should find it practicable— Especially if Congress should adjourn before the time. To this I consented and promised to give them notice, as soon as I can ascertain whether it will be in my power or not— I called yesterday afternoon on Dr. N. L. Frothingham, who was confined to his chamber with a hoarse cold, under which he had been suffering, while preaching the day before; and instead of talking with him about his Sermons, on the solemn week, and the government of the thoughts as I ought to have done, I wasted the time in talking myself about Othello and Lear— This day the Northeast storm continues, with alternate rain, mist, fog, and suspension till the evening, when certain lucid spots in the west gave promise of a clear morrow— Morning visit from Dr George Parkman, who spoke much of Mr. Alexandre Vatemare’s literary exchanges, and of the new Society of the Alumni of Harvard College, neither of which seemed to have his approbation. He adheres to the exclusive fellowship of the Φ.B.K of which fraternity he is a member, and the selectness of which he thinks a precious and most efficient stimulus to emulation— The new Society does not annul, but must necessarily swallow up the Phi beta kappa. Dr Parkman made also some enquiry concerning that adventuring Lady, who two years ago came on the voucher of an alledged lineal descendant from that Florentine Non discoverer of this hemisphere which bears his name, to demand a grant of landed territory from the Congress of the United States— My opinion of her coincides with that of Dr Parkman. Before dinner, I walked for exercise round the Common: in 25 minutes— Evening visit from Mr Degrand: during which I went with my Son to the Odeon, and heard Dr. Palfrey deliver one of a course of Lectures upon the Evidences of Christianity. Degrand still here when we came back. "

Received two Letters having reference to that subject—one from Simeon S. Jocelyn, Joshua Leavitt and Lewis Tappan the Committee at New-York, which has supported them through all their trials, expressing a grateful acknowledgment of my services in their behalf. The other from Arnold Buffum, dated the 19th. instt. at New-Garden Indiana, complaining bitterly of the act of Congress of 1793. prescribing the process for taking up fugitive Slaves; and of certain proceedings of the colonization Society; with a postscript suggesting an amendment to the Constitution changing the mode of electing the President of the United States— This election of a chief magistrate for the whole Union, will never be settled to the satisfaction of the People. The theory of elective Monarchy is that the choice may fall upon the wisest, and the best— The theory of frequent elections is that power cannot be long trusted to the same hands even of the wisest and the best. The two parts can be reconciled to each other only by the inconsistency and corruptibility of human nature in its best estate: and never, never will any great people be satisfied with the result of their own elections of an executive head— We have now the tenth President of the United States brought into Office, in the space of 52 years that the Constitution has been in operation— One amendment has already changed the mode of election prescribed by that instrument— A second practical alteration has limited the term of service to two periods of four years— And a third is growing upon the impatience of the people, for a further limitation to one term of 4 years, while the office itself is falling into hands incompetent to the management, and upon heads inadequate even to the conception of any comprehensive system of administration for the affairs of a great confederated Nation— There is not a mind now occupied in the executive administration of this Government, and the only change yet accomplished, is of one set of low and miserable expedients for another.— The only prospect now is of recoiling to the last with aggravation of a shameless failure of the apparent extrication of the Country from the fangs of a worthless and profligate faction— I walked out before dinner and visited my very old friend Joseph Hall; and my younger, but yet old friend Dr George Parkman. Mr Hall engaged me to dine with him, to-morrow with my Son. At Dr Parkman’s I met Mrs James T. Austin and her daughter. Dined at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s—Governor Lincoln—Mr Joseph Lyman of Northampton Edward and Peter C. Brooks junr. with his wife, and Doctor Frothingham were the company. Governor Lincoln very pleasant— Evening visit to Mr and Mrs Abbott Lawrence— He had been here. I am to see him again to-morrow. "

                "text": "29. IV. Thursday  John Kirke came in from Quincy this morning. My Son went out there with him, and came back to dinner. Kirke had a confused story about the family of the Leary’s, and of a scramble among them for the little property left by Jeremy— I had received a Letter from Mr John Lewis of Killarney, with whom Jerry had lived, intreating me to have the property left by Jerry remitted to his father, and a Letter from Mary Flynn Jerry’s sister at Quincy making the same request— Kirke said that Mary Flynn the Irish Girl who lived with us last year had given out that she was married to Jeremy— Louisa C. Smith was here, but I could see her only for a moment; being obliged to attend the annual meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society— I found there about 25 members, and James Savage presiding in the place of Thomas L. Winthrop deceased since the last meeting that I had attended, which was last August 29. As I went in Dr Charles Lowell, corresponding Secretary of the Society came and expressed his pleasure that my Son had become a member of the Society; and he spoke in warm and friendly terms of the reputation that he had acquired— He was elected at the last Monthly Meeting, but by some accident had not received the regular notification of it— There was a report from a Committee read by the Chairman Mr Ticknor somewhat extending the privilege of borrowing books from the library, which after some discussion was adopted— Sundry donations from a person at Florence, through Governor Edward Everett, and a singular communication from the daughter of the Commandeur Torlade d’Azambuja, heretofore a Minister from Don Miguel of Portugal, and elected an honorary member of the Society, announcing his decease, complaining that the Portuguese Government refused to pay 45000 crusades which they owed for his diplomatic services in this Country and requesting the Society to raise by contribution a sum of money to erect a monument to his memory.— It was asked what should be done with this letter, and reference was made to me for an opinion, which was that the most respectful mode of treating it was to leave it without answer— The last year’s Officers were all re-elected upon one ticket, and the meeting adjourned, about 1/2 past 1. I waited for Charles till a quarter past 2. and then went to Mr Hall’s— Charles came in after we had sitten down to table. His youngest son Ellis Gray dined with us, but not his Sister He told me that he was 80. last monday.— The wreck of an honest, honourable man, and of a true and faithful friend— We came way about 5. Tea at Charles’s. Mr Lyman of Northampton there— Evening at Abbott Lawrence’s—found them at tea— F. C. Gray there— After tea I had a private conference of three hours with Mr Lawrence. He read me his plan for a bank. It was near 11. when I came home. Mr William Plumer of Epping New Hampshire had been here. "

I did not pass the sill of the door of the house, this whole day, and all that I effected was to bring up the arrears of this diary, and to begin a Letter to my wife which I could not finish: Mr Plumer junr of Epping New Hampshire paid me a morning visit— He was desirous of obtaining the Office of U.S. Navy Agent at Portsmouth but it has been given to another— John and Michael Leary were here; and Mary Flynn, and there is quite a commotion among them about the property left by Jeremy.— John, as Administrator of his brother has received 172 dollars from my Son upon my order for a note and wages due by me to Jerry at the time of his death— He has remitted to his father ten pounds equal to fifty dollars, but wrote him that it was of his own money.— He has entered upon a book some charges paid and for the expenses of his journey to and from Washington when he took out letters of administration, upon which I with W. S. Smith became his bondsmen— But he knows not how to draw up an administration account, and imagines he has much more discretion in the disposal than the Law allows him— Among his charges is one of 11. dollars for cloathing for his brother Michael, which I told him the judge would certainly not allow.— Mary Flynn, claims upwards of forty dollars, for money lent to Jerry, 12.50 of which John admits, and of the remainder she has no evidence; and there are strong presumptions against the claim— But she has given out that she was married to Jerry, and I told her if it was so she was entitled to one third of his property but could not claim any money lent— I asked her if she had been married to him and she said she could not answer that question— She might some time hereafter, but could not now— She intimated too that Jerry had a child in the Province of New Brunswick, for whom some provision from his property ought to be made, and John supposed that some claim might hereafter be produced upon some written promise by him to pay for the nurture of the child— I find I shall need no small circumspection to protect my own responsibility as John’s bondsman upon the Letters of Administration— I urged him to make immediately a further remittance of twenty pounds to his father: and to make several other arrangements for presenting his account of administration to the Orphans Court at Washington— These visits and interruptions absorbed all the morning. A visit after dinner from Mr Richard D. Tucker detained me, and Mr Brooks after tea spent the Evening here. Charles went to hear Dr Palfrey’s closing lecture on the evidences of Christianity— Received an invitation to dine with Mr Tucker, next Thursday. "

The meeting next Wednesday Evening which he invited me to attend and to address was of the Mercantile Library Association, and it is called at the instigation of Mr Alexandre Vattemare, to consider of a proposal for an union of that and sundry other similar Institutions in this City into one, to form a common library, and collections of Natural history, geology, medals, coins, and the like— I could not refuse my attendance at the Meeting.— Nor to address them, for the fashion of talking in public “a tort et à travers,[”] has become a sort of indispensable duty to every public man; but the position of Mr Vattemare himself is something between a public benefactor and a Charlatan, and I have introduced, countenanced and supported him quite as much as was consistent with a due regard for my own reputation— I am not so sanguine as he is in the expectation of great results from the exchanges of duplicate books, manuscripts and the like, and as to his project of melting up here all the literary associations into one, I am not so well satisfied of its utility, as to give it a public commendation— I found myself this morning with hoarseness much increased, a heavy cold, and troublesome sore throat— But the morning was fair and promising, and with Charles, his wife and three elder children I attended public worship at the first Church, and heard Dr Frothingham preach from Galatians 5.11. [“]Then is the offence of the Cross ceased.” These words are used by St. Paul in connection with an argument to dissuade the Galatians from practising the rite of circumcision. as they stand with the context their meaning is somewhat obscure—but Dr. Frothingham generalised the import of the remark, and considered the cessation of the Offence of the Cross in all its various aspects, through the whole range of the history of Christendom— It was communion day, and I remained, and took the communion in Mr Brooks’s pew with him— Dr Frothingham’s administration of this ceremony, was solemn and edifying; uniting gracefulness of manner with all the simplicity of the usual congregational mode of performing it— The afternoon service was by Dr Thomas Gray of Jamaica Plains—Roxbury.— His Sermon was from 1. Timothy 5.22. “neither be partaker of other men’s sins”— Dr. Gray was a Classmate of my brother Thomas and is now one of the oldest clergymen in the State— The style of preaching has much changed since his younger days, but his enumeration of the various ways in which men may become partakers of the sins of others, and his exhortations against them all, held forth sound and profitable doctrine— Mr Brooks invited me to spend the Evening at his house, but the weather was so unfavourable that it confined us to the house— I made some progress in the revisal of my Amistad Speech, and spent the Evening in conversation, my hoarseness and sore-throat increasing.

A feverish, and almost sleepless night, with a burning sore throat and symptoms of quinsy followed by a dry convulsive cough this day, and hoarseness hard of utterance— By good advice I kept house the whole of this day, further admonished thereto by a fall of snow all the morning, and cheerless cold till the clearing up at Night— My resort was to a Seidlitz powder, Blackberry jelly diluted in water, and lastly at Night flax-seed tea— The day passed in no wise tediously away; but I could devote very little of it to labour of writing or even of reading— Mr Curtis of Roxbury called on me with a Letter from Petty Vaughan of 29. June last, relating to the administration of the Estate of Ward N. Boylston and copy of a Letter from Mr Curtis and Mrs Boylston to P.

Winthrop, who has just returned from Washington— He went hence with Josiah Quincy junr. last Monday, and returned yesterday morning with Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, who proceeded this day to Marshfield; taking with him Governor Doty of Wiskonsin— After dinner and evening visits from Mr Vatemare, Harriet Welsh, and Dr Frothingham— Vatemare came for five minutes and stayed three hours— His conversation is vastly entertaining; but his flattery is maukish, his Vanity, hardly supportable, and his system a perpetual bore— He left with me a manuscript in English of some seventy pages, and which he says will cover six columns of the Notion, the largest Newspaper in the World—being the Address which he is to deliver at the Meeting next Wednesday Evening, in commendation of his system— I had received from Dr Frothingham for the managers of the Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge an invitation to deliver the introductory Lecture to their course for the next Winter, on the first Wednesday of next November; and this day I had an invitation to dine with them next Wednesday at the Tremont house, which I am obliged to decline— So much of this day was absorbed by these visitors, that very little of it was left to make progress in the revisal of my Speech on the Amistad captives case; now my most oppressive burden. In the Courier of this morning is published the first of a series of papers by my son, upon the dismal catastrophe, wreck and ruin of N. Biddle’s bank of the United States. "

I bespoke from a Seal engraver named Mitchell a Seal, with the Arms of Adams, taken from the double seal which my father had made after the Peace of Paris in 1783, with his forest and fishery device on the other side; and which Seal my father gave to my Son John—and from him it passed to his widow, Mary Catherine Adams to whom it now belongs.— There are families of Adams in almost every County of England, Wales and Ireland. These arms are of the family in Lincolnshire, which my father believed to be those of his paternal ancestors, though he always used those of the Boylston, his mother’s family— As there is in the family now only one seal bearing these arms, I have determined to get another engraved, and to leave it with my Son, so that the tradition may not be lost.— As I was coming out of Mr Mitchell’s shop, I met Mr Beale, and Mr Brigham who had come in from Quincy, with an invitation from the inhabitants of the Town, to me, to deliver an Eulogy, on the late President Harrison, on the 14th. of this Month, the day recommended by his Successor, the present acting President John Tyler, for humiliation and prayer on account of his decease— Having declined the same invitations from Dorchester and Brighton I had no alternative but to do the same with Quincy, to which the present state of my voice further concluded— I called on Mr Ellis Gray Loring, at his Office, and requested him to furnish me with the 10th. 11th. and 12th. volume of Wheaton’s Reports containing the several decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, in three successive years in the case of the Antelope— And also to ascertain if Mr Grattan, the British Consul here has a set of the Parliamentary Documents, relating to the Slave-trade for the years 1839 and 1840. of which I could obtain the loan. Much conversation with Mr Loring, on Slavery and its abolition— Received two letters from Russel Freeman, with enclosures for the Secretary of the Treasury; and two Letters from my wife— Mr Vattemare spent the Evening here with a small party of the family and friends invited to meet him; before whom he exhibited some of his antics of ventriloquism, and multiplied personification—planing of a table, buzzing of a fly, frying of an omelet, barking of a dog, and the like— I returned to him his manuscript discourse which I had read— And this with N. Biddle’s 5th and 6th. Letters to John M. Clayton consumed much of the day. "

Thursday  Mr Daniel Ingalls an old revolutionary claimant for a pension left with me three papers in support of his claim— His petition has been before the house of Representatives the whole of the last Congress.— His papers now exhibited to me are a Letter from the Commissioner of pensions J. L. Edwards to John Knapp, Boston, dated 5. July 1839. stating that neither the Clothier Generals assistants nor Store keepers were entitled to pensions for military service; and that further evidence was requisite to prove the service of Ingalls as a Soldier— A Letter from William Parmenter to Dr. William Ingalls of 3. June 1840. enclosing a Note from John Taliaferro, Chairman of the Committee of Revolutionary Pensions H.R.U.S.—which states that Officers in the clothing department are no where recognized as military Officers; but that the service of Daniel Ingalls as a private soldier from January 1777 to December 1779 is attested by Coll. John Moylan’s certificate, and though short of 2 years (here is a mistake) together with his other long service as Clothier, ought to entitle him to a full pension as a private under the act of 1832—to commence from the 4th. March 1831. Mr Parmenter hopes a Bill will be reported; but doubts whether it will be in time for passage at that Session— It does not appear to have been reported either at that or the subsequent Session— It will be still in the charge of Mr Parmenter; and Mr Ingalls claims my assistance; which I promised him, in the measure of my ability— Mr Warren was here about renting a house. Deals in Medals, Coins and other curiosities— After full occupation from 4. A.M. to 1. P.M. with the intervals for Breakfast, Newspaper reading and idle turns, I walked out and visited at Robert C. Winthrop’s (not at home, I left a card.) and at James H Foster’s, where I saw him, his wife and three daughters, and Louisa C Smith— Then at home and wrote a few lines to my wife— Then walk with Charles through a heavy shower of rain to dine with Mr Richard D. Tucker. Mrs and Miss Tucker at table—Mr P. C. Brooks—Governor Lincoln, Samuel T. Armstrong, Isaac P. Davis Joseph Tilden T. C. Grattan, Mr Page, and Mr Vattemare were the company— Mr Webster was expected but did not come— The dinner profuse and luxurious— I enquired of Mr Grattan, if he had and could lend me the Parliamentary Documents of 1839 and 40. upon the Slave-trade: he said he had them not, but had written for them to Mr Buchanan the British Consul at New-York, and expected to receive them soon.— We sat after dinner at table, and after the Ladies had withdrawn till near 9. O’Clock, when we came home with a clear sky— As we were going to Mr Tucker’s we had met Governor John Davis, with the Secretary John P. Bigelow, on their way to the Statehouse— "

I was roused from sleep this morning by a fit of coughing; and after supposing for some time that day-light was approaching, was advised of the hour by one of the City Clocks striking two— I lighted my lamp, and after laying another hour in bed without sleep, rose, and betook myself to my daily task, which is now the revision of my Amistad Speech— My Son went to Quincy, taking with him his Son Charles, and returned home to dinner— Mr William Ellis of Dedham was here. I had two Letters from him, one of 26 Jany and the other of 26. March last, relating to a Pension claim of William Barron. With the former was a Petition and sundry papers, which before leaving Washington, I had repeatedly searched for in vain, till I believed I had not received them— Upon conversing however with Mr Ellis, and recurring to my list of Petitions, received after the 21st. of January, and therefore not presented at the last Session of Congress I found it entered there on the 29th. of January—and the papers are upon my files at Washington to be remembered at the next Session of Congress— Visit from Mr Isaac P. Davis, with whom I called to see Miss Winthrop—daughter of the late President of the Massachusetts, Historical and Antiquarian Societies. She was engaged, and I left a card— Davis led me to Daggett’s and another shop where I saw sundry Portraits painted by Copley, and other pictures— I received a Letter from my wife with a bill of lading for my box of books and papers and other Articles ship’d at Alexandria, for this port— After dinner I slumbered for two hours on my bed to make up for the loss of repose last Night. Towards evening Dr Abner Phelps called upon me, and requested an interview with me, which I promised, and for which I agreed to go to his house in Oliver Street N. 23. next Monday afternoon at 5. O’Clock— And I spent part of this Evening from 8 to 10. with Charles’s wife at Mrs Samuel Dexter’s. Charles came there after us— Mrs Dexter’s daughter, widow M’Kay was there, and is now living with her— She expressed herself highly gratified that her Son Franklin Dexter had called upon me— The Steamer Britannia came in at 2. O’Clock yesterday morning after a passage of sixteen days from Liverpool. She sailed on the 20th. of last Month— The Steamer President which sailed from New-York on the 8th. of March; and on board of which, Mr Cookman the late eloquent Chaplain of the U.S. Senate had embarked had not arrived in England, nor has she been heard from since her departure— There is little hope of her being ever heard from hereafter— The Britannia brings accounts of a settlement of the quarrel between Great Britain and China— Six Millions of dollars of indemnity to be paid by the Chinese— An Island ceded to Great-Britain— All future negotiation to be upon equal terms— Yet the Peace is said not to be satisfactory in England— "

It roused me again last night, to hear the church Clock strike 11. and this morning before it struck three— I rose before 4 and idled away great part of the morning.— Mr Hardwick and Mr Rice came to enquire, about a Petition which Rice has before Congress, and which I presented to the House at the first Session of the last Congress— It shared the fate at the last Session of the great multitude of other Petitions— Nothing was done with it, and I had forgotten it. Mr Rice proposed, and I advised him to have a supplementary Petition drawn up, which I may take with me—and present at the approaching Session. A man from Mr Gillett the Quincy Stageman, brought me an Affidavit of Mary Flynn that she lent Jeremy Leary—last autumn 29 and 12 1/2 dollars— Mr Curtis of Roxbury was here— He had sent me a packet of Letters, and papers received from Petty Vaughan so voluminous that I had shrunk from looking into them.— Upon opening the packet now I found a series of Letters from Mr Vaughan to the Executors of Ward N. Boylston’s Will, from 20. June to 2. March last—with a copy of one Letter from Mr Curtis and Mrs Boylston to Vaughan dated 30. Novr last, and an enormous indenture of release and indemnity of seven large folio close written pages, to be executed by us; by me as Administrator de bonis non of Thomas Boylston, and by John Lane Boylston with a supplementary approval of his two Sons.— Upon a cursory glance at these papers, I told Mr Curtis that I wished for time to examine the Indenture before executing it, and had some doubts whether it was not too comprehensive— He promised to call again early next week and to bring some of the previous correspondence with Petty Vaughan, to account for the expediency of our executing this Indenture of Release and Indemnity— Mrs Boylston is going to visit her Son, but I proposed to postpone the Execution of the Indenture till after her return— Time consumed till my walk was abridged to a tour round the Mall and Common.— Dined with Dr John C. Warren, and the Trustees of the Agricultural Society. Peter C. Brooks—Henry Codman, Henry Coleman, Isaac P. Davis, Mr Finney, Benjamin Guild, Mr King, Abbott Lawrence, Levi Lincoln, Francis C.

                "text": "9. III.45. Sunday.  Beautiful Spring like day— Dr Frothingham’s morning Sermon was from Proverbs 9.10—[“]the knowledge of the holy, is understanding.” From the tenor of the discourse Dr Frothingham, appeared to consider the words the holy as referring here not to persons, but to things—the knowledge of holy things— But according to the Latin vulgate and the French translation of Martin the reading of this text should be—the Science of the Saints is Prudence,— After some remarks upon the direct meaning of this passage as understood by him the Doctor said there was an inference derivable from it, of knowledge, which is not understanding; which can be no other than the knowledge of the unholy— He laid it down therefore as a theme for illustration that the knowledge of the unholy is not understanding— He then divided the unholy into the frivolous—the dishonest and the forbidden, from an ingenious and fanciful analysis of which he drew copious arguments to show, that the knowledge of them is not understanding—not useful but pernicious—the acquisition of it idle and culpable waste of time—the curiosity to acquire it, misapplication of the thirst for knowledge, itself a virtuous propensity— The use of it tending to dangerous and evil temptations, and he pointedly referred to the command of God to our first Parents in Paradise to abstain from tasting the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil planted in the middle of the garden.— Dr Frothingham’s manner of treating his subject is original, and perhaps too intellectual to be popular— His composition is beautiful, and with exquisite passages in the every discourse, but not always equably sustained— His Sermon this afternoon was from Matthew. 9.8. [“]But when the multitude saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.” This is said on the occasion of the miracle performed by Jesus, in healing the palsied man, to demonstrate his power to forgive sins. But Dr Frothingham considered it as an exemplification of the amazement of the multitude, at the power, bestowed by the almighty upon the race of men— But this was the mistake of the Multitude.— The power exercised by Jesus of healing the palsied man, and of forgiving his sins, was not given unto men— It was the peculiar and exclusive power of the Messiah; and the latter was never conferred by him, even upon the Apostles— Dr Frothingham’s Discourse was an eloquent declamation upon the contrasted powers and impotence of the human race. A subject upon which an abundance of antithetical amplifications naturally came up, and were formed into periods of elegant composition; accompanied by doctrines of the purest morality— Mr Degrand called upon me this Evening, but with Charles and his wife we spent 2 hours of this Evening at Mr Brooks’s— His Son P. C. junr with his wife, live with him— Dr and Mrs Frothingham, and their Son Thomas were there—and Mr and Mrs Henshaw— I began this day the Review of the case of the Antelope. "

I received from him a Letter of solicitation for influence in his favour before I left Washington, and now he came to ask a Letter to Governor Lincoln not of recommendation, but to intimate my wish that he may be appointed— It was painful to refuse; yet I could not depart from a general and necessary rule. I said I expected to see Governor Lincoln, and would speak to him. Mr French, the Postmaster at Quincy, came with Thomas Adams junr. and a subscription paper to purchase a fire engine, to be held in shares of 5 dollars each, and of which I took two— They asked me to give it a name, but I declined. French brought me a budget of Letters and Newspapers which absorbed my time as a spunge drinks water. Alexander H. Everett called to take leave— He has been appointed President of a College in Louisiana, about 60 miles above New-Orleans, and is going there— I spoke of his report to the late President Van Buren, upon the examination of the charges against N. P. Trist, Consul at the Havana; and lent him my copy of the printed copy of the document communicated by President Van Buren, to the House of Representatives on the 3d. of March last— Steady, moderate rain the whole day. I went into the State-house and enquired for the Journal of U.S. Senate for 1839–40— They had not received it, though they have the journal of the house for the same Session— I found the first Message P.U.S to S.U.S. on the cases of the Comet, Encomium and Enterprize. 13. Feby. 1837— I returned by cards the visits of H. G. Otis and S. T. Armstrong— After dinner a person named Thayer from Camden, Maine, came to make enquiries about Nancy Molineux, first wife of Ward Nicholas Boylston, whose descendants at Charleston S.C. are raising some claim by inheritance from her, to certain lands in Camden, and in which Mr Thayer has a proprietary right.— I answered as far as I was able his enquiries, concerning the first Mrs. Boylston, and her descendants at Charleston— At 5. p.m. I called by appointment on Dr. Abner Phelps at his house in Oliver Street N. 23. and had about an hour’s conversation with him about a projected invention of his of a defensive Steam battery to meet a possible invasion— He wishes experiments of its efficacy to be made, under the direction of the Navy Department, and promised at my request to draw up an exposition of his plan, in writing, and give or send it to me, before my departure for Washington— Evening with Charles and Abby at home.

He says he has not received a cent of Pension since 1836. He has a petition before Congress presented the Session before last by Mr Saltonstall which he will call up at the approaching Session, and for which Mr Churchill asked and I promised what little assistance it may be in my power to give. Miss Welsh followed with a copy of the Treatise on the Theory and practice of Landscape gardening recently published by Mr A. J. Downing, of Newburgh and which as he informed me last November was his intention he has dedicated to me— Dr George Parkman came and sat in conversation with me upon various topics— This Gentleman is one of the most assiduous and obliging friends that I have in the world—but eccentric in his manners, and reserved in his general associations, I scarcely know how to make a suitable return for his good Offices. Mr William Foster made me also a visit— I made some enquiries of him concern a dishonest story connected with the failure of the Commonwealth’s bank in this City; and about which Mr Foster had written me two Letters. He said he would ask Mr Wright to call upon me— At Charles’s Office, I was looking up the Laws of the United States for the suppression of the Slave trade— Call on Mr Ellis Gray Loring, who was going this afternoon to attend the Anti-Slavery Meetings at New-York He gave me a Letter to Mr Boyle the Librarian of the Social Law Library, which I did not find— Morning visits to judge John and Isaac P.

Volumes of his History of the United States, which he intends to close with the inauguration of Washington at New-York as President of the United States in 1789. He asked me to lend him my Portrait of Thomas Jefferson, by Mather Brown, to have it engraved, which I promised— With Charles’s wife I spent the Evening at Dr Frothingham’s—Mr P. C. Brooks was there, and Charles came in towards the close— We came home at 10. Short answer to Mr Frye. I desired Mr E. G.

Charles went out to Quincy, and took with him his Son John Quincy.— They returned home to dinner: but I am so chained down by the review of the case of the Antelope, that I could not leave it to go to Quincy— As usual my work swells upon me as I proceed, and I know not when I shall get through with it— I found at last the way to the social Law Library in the Court-house, and delivered to Mr Boyle the Librarian, the Letter from Mr Ellis Gray Loring— Mr Boyle immediately furnished me three books that I wanted.—5. Wheaton, where at p. 338 I found the case of the Josefa Segunda, cited by W. Davies U.S. District judge for Georgia, in the case of the Antelope as authority for decreeing the restoration of that vessel and 63 negroes taken in her to Spanish owners, after they had been forfeited to the United States by the attempt of the Captors to smuggle the negroes into the United States, and upon reading it was satisfied with it as an authority, directly in point against the decision of Davies but I had time to read only a part of the case of the slave Grace in Haggards Admiralty Reports 2.94. so remarkable for the learning of the judge, Lord Stowell in support of Slavery, and of which Mr Van Buren made such effective use in his note claiming indemnity in the cases of the Comet, Encomium and Enterprize—and could only look at the case of the Negro Somerset in Howell’s State Trials 20. p. 1. which I must not pass over without reading. Judge John Davis, Mr Bassett the Clerk of the U.S. Circuit and District Courts, and Mr Franklin Dexter now the US. District Attorney came in while I was there; but I was obliged very soon to leave the books and come home— Morning visit from General Dearborn; and Mr P. C. Brooks and Dr Frothingham dined with us at Charles’s, by his invitation to meet me— I spent the Evening at the Revd. Mr Samuel Kirkland Lothrop’s with that old Wednesday Evening’s club of which I became a member in 1790 and which continues to this day— Mr Lothrop is Minister of the Brattle Street Church, and I remembered that the last time I had been in the house was about June 1809 at the same Wednesday Evening Club. Mr Buckminster being then the occupant of the house and the Minister of that congregation— There was not one of the members of that time now present. This evening there was James Savage, Dr Bigelow, Dr John G. Palfrey—Dr Francis Parkman, Mr Carey, Mr G. B. Emerson, and five or six other younger men, whom I did not know— I had some conversation with Dr Bigelow, about the discoveries of Messrs. Stevens and Catherwood, of Magnificent ruins of antient cities in the interior of this Continent, and of which there are rumours in circulation; of which I have as yet heard not much, but expect shortly to hear more— I came home between 10 and 11.

Degrand came with a written memoir of three sheets of paper to prove that the contemplated National Bank should be established at Boston, in preference to New-York or Philadelphia. As he has settled the matter to his own satisfaction, in his own mind, I heard him read his memoir and his argumentative exposition of it; and he promised me a copy of it. His information upon commercial subjects is very great, and his opinions are swayed as usual by his personal interests. He was with me about two hours, when Mr Payne came in and Degrand retired. Paine has pursued Astronomical studies with some success, and has solicited an appointment as Secretary of Legation in Germany, France or Italy, to pursue in the leisure of his official functions the same studies further.— I wish he may be gratified— He spoke of the construction of Astronomical instruments; the best of which he thinks are now made at Munich— He thought the best Telescope in this Country, one lately imported for the high School at Philadelphia; now in charge of Mr Walker, actuary of the Life Insurance Company, Chesnut Street; whom I shall see, if I can— Dr Parkman followed Mr Paine, and invited me to a small family party at his house this evening, but I had a previous engagement. Miss Smith’s visit was short— Charles came home to dinner, and at 5. p.m. we went with his wife and three elder children, Mrs Frothingham, her two little girls and boy to concert hall and saw Monsieur Daguerre’s Diorama, of the interior of the Church of Saint Etienne at Paris at Noon by Sunshine, and the Midnight Mass by Moonlight. Then a view of Constantinople, and finally a view of Venice, by day and by night— The most remarkable part of the show, is the gradual decline and return of light resembling the natural transitions between day and Night; and the change of Scenery upon the same canvas effected by the change. This is a different invention of Monsieur Daguerre from that of fixing the pictures of the Camera obscura.— After stopping with Mrs Charles at Metcalf’s for a glass of carbonated mead, I left her with her children at her door, and walked round the railing of the Common in 22 minutes, making a measurement of 1 1/4 mile— Dr and Mrs Frothingham spent the Evening here— He has made, and is about to publish a translation in verse, of the fragment of Aratus upon Astronomy. Dr Palfrey came in for half an hour; and told me jokingly that Combe the Scottish phrenologist, has published a book of travels, in which he scores me for my Letter to Dr Sewall, expressing my incredulity of the truth or usefulness of that pretended Science.

                "text": "14. IV:30. Friday.  Tyler day of humiliation and prayer—  The Revd. Mr Anthony, brought me a Letter of introduction from Nathaniel B. Borden, member elect from the 10th congressional district to H.R.U.S.— Mr Anthony wishes for the appointment of consul at the Island of Haiti, or if no consul should be appointed then that of commercial agent— I told him of the difficulties that there were in the way of an appointment either of Consul or of commercial agent; and I advised him before those difficulties could be surmounted to look up, and seek the acquaintance, and good will of the claimants upon the Haitian Government for indemnities—here at Salem and at Baltimore. And I said I would consult with Mr Borden at the meeting of Congress, to see if we can obtain a recognition by our Government, of that of Haiti, without which no appointment, either of Consul or of commercial agent, would be of any avail— Mr Foster and Mr Wright came, while Mr Anthony was here, and after he went away Mr Wright told me a story of filthy corruption and fraud in the settlement of public claims, involving the moral honesty of men in the highest dignities in both the great political parties, and whom I do not venture here to name, though he named them to me; because having no evidence against them other than his declaration and public notoriety, I will not blast them upon this record without more conclusive testimony— Mr Wright’s memorial will be still before the House in Congress— He told me that he addressed it to Congress, after having presented it to the then President Van Buren, who refused to have it investigated and referred the whole subject to the very persons implicated in the frauds. He promised to send me some documentary evidence of the facts— And said he should himself go to Washington during the approaching Session of Congress. At 11. this morning I attended with Charles and his two elder sons at the first Congregational Church where Dr Frothingham performed divine service and delivered a discourse from Revelation 20.12. “And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God[”]— He alluded to the National thanksgiving in 1815 for the Peace with Great-Britain just after his settlement as Pastor of the Church; and to the National fast in 1832 for the Cholera—and after contrasting and comparing those occasions with the presents he observed that whatever of Eulogy was due to the memory of the late President Harrison had been already performed— He would therefore turn to the more general subject of the general resurrection of the dead— Small and great in stature in condition, in talents &c— After the Sermon, I went with Mr P. C. Brooks Charles and his wife and son Charles to Medford; where we dined with Mr. Gorham Brooks. After dinner Mrs B Brooks and Mr Gardner came it— We came home between 8 and 9. "

Saturday  I labour in vain to perform my daily tasks—and this morning after toiling from Sunrise till near Noon, with an interval of half an hour for breakfast I went forth to return sundry visits— I received from the Seal engraver F. N. Mitchell, a small Seal of the Adams arms, [symbols] I have had engraved from that of my father, which he gave to my Son John—which I have in my keeping, but which belongs to his widow— I wish it preserved for my Sons children, as a memorial of my father’s belief of the family in England from which we descended, and possibly to trace the connection more clearly hereafter. I called upon Mr George Bancroft, no longer collector of the customs at this port, but still the historian of the United States He kept me with him about two hours, during part of which his Sister’s husband Governor John Davis came in— We had some idle conversation upon the politics of the day; and much, more interesting, about the work upon which he is engaged He is very desirous of obtaining access to my fathers private papers and diaries and particularly to see his Letter from Worcester to Nathan Webb in September 1755— I promised to shew him the entry upon his diary of the Committee from the town of Boston to engage him to appear with Jeremy Gridley and James Otis before Governor Bernard and his Council, in support of the Memorial of the Town praying that the Courts of Justice might be opened without requiring the use of stamps. He referred to the statement of the fact in Hutchinson’s third volume. He asked if in the diary there was any notice of the debates in Congress on the declaration of Independence— I said no—but some account of them written many years after— And that my father had always considered the great struggle of debate upon the question of Independence to have been upon the Resolution of the 10th. and its preamble of the 15th. of May 1776— Mr Bancroft took down the Volume of the Journals of Congress and read and marked the entries of 10 and 15. May 1776. On returning home I found Mr Curtis of Roxbury had been here, with the Letter book of the Executors of Ward N. Boylston’s Will, and sundry Letters of Petty Vaughan which I examined— He came again before 3. and promised to come Tuesday or Wednesday morning next to Quincy, to consult and determine what we shall do with Mr Petty Vaughan’s Indenture of indemnity. Just as we were going out to dinner, Miss Welsh came in— With Charles I went at 4. and dined with Mr Bassett the Clerk of the Circuit and District Courts, at the United States Hotel. The company R. Choate, B. Curtis, judge John and I. P. Davis, F. Dexter, Edmund Dwight, Solomon Lincoln, Revd. S. K. Lothrop, Jeremiah Mason, Willard Phillips, Lemuel Shaw, Joseph Story,Ticknor and Frederick Tudor, with Mr Bassett, Charles and myself— Evening at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s, and conversation with him on the result of his interviews with Mr Webster, who has returned to Washington. Mrs Lawrence told me of the death of Charles Ogle. "

Cloudy morning, threatening foul weather and I saw not the rising of the Sun—but I pursued the labour of reviewing the case of the Antelope with a short half hour of intermission, till past 1. p.m. and then visited my Garden— I was so much absorbed in occupation the last Autumn, that I sowed scarcely any seeds, and find nothing up, but about a dozen apple-seeds just out of the ground— Of the trees of preceding years, some have died—numbers have been transplanted by John Kirk to my Sons place on the hill; many were crop’d by the mower’s scythe last summer, and are perishing. a few are just shewing their leaves and promise growth this Season— The two best grown Apple-trees of 1834. which bore blossoms, and one of them 3 or 4. apples last Summer, bear none this Season— The seedling Apple-tree fronting the Southeasternmost study window, one of my darlings, has been nearly girdled in the course of the winter by field mice, but survives and will make wood this Season— One plum just before the Southwest corner of the house is in full blossom, and a few of the peach trees in the garden— The cherry-blossoms are opening, but those of the Apples and Pears are not yet visible— The Season is three full weeks behind its usual advancement.— My Son has leased the Mount Wollaston farm to a man by the name of Eaton, and the Penn’s hill farm to the Son of Alpheus Spear.— I shall have no time to make arrangements for them, and must leave all the management of them to him. He came out with his family before dinner this day, and they are to stay with me till my departure for Washington— Meanwhile this house is undergoing some repairs and fresh outward painting. Mr E. Price Greenleaf came after dinner—brought home some German books that he had borrowed, and will come to-morrow for more. He pointed out to me the white blossoms and green wood of the white Magdalen peach trees. I found the volume containing my Sabbath-morning hymn, and took it to Mr Lunt— He intends to include it in his new-hymn-book for the Parish—my 104th. and perhaps 149th. Psalm— And part of the Stanzas written in sickness— He divides his collection into 5 books, and arranges them in classes— I visited Mrs Ann Adams Her Sister Mrs Phineas Foster and her daughter Fanny were there. Also Isaac-Hull— Elizabeth C. Adams is expected home at the end of this week. John Leary was here this Evening and I advised him to prepare an Account of his Administration, to be presented to the Orphans Court when I go to Washington. He is to come again to-morrow. "

I did not now recognize him or remember his name till he reminded me of his former visit.— He brought now an earnest recommendation of him, signed by 21 respectable inhabitants of Dukes County— I advised him to prepare and forward to me, an application in his own name to the Secretary of the Treasury for the appointment; and promised to take it, and the recommendation with me to Washington, and deliver them to the Secretary— Mr Curtis came over from Roxbury and brought with him the Letters lately received from Petty Vaughan, together with his projected Indenture of Release, Quit-claim and Indemnity from us to him, and to be executed by us as Executors of Ward N. Boylston, by me as Administrator de bonis non of Thomas Boylston with the Will annexed—by John Lane Boylston, in his own right, with a separate declaration of assent by his two sons Ward N. Boylston, and Thomas Boylston who are now both of age— I read carefully through for the second time this egregiously lengthened document of seven closely written folio pages, and concluded that there is no occasion or necessity for us to sign it; and still less to require the signatures of John Lane Boylston and his two sons— Mr. Curtis concurred in this opinion, and I promised between this and next Saturday to make a draught of a Release such as we may execute to discharge Mr Petty Vaughan from all responsibility to us as Executors of Ward N. Boylston or to me as Administrator of Thomas Boylston, for any payments made by him to us— He promised to come over here again on Saturday. The remainder of the day—I was deeply engaged on the review of the case of the Antelope, which I fear I shall yet be obliged to abridge, or to leave unfinished.— I closed this evening a short Letter to my wife— Charles went to Boston, and returned to dinner— The weather continues so cold that vegetation makes scarcely any progress— Mr Curtis says there was a frost last night, and looking into a Calendar of 1834 I found an entry under date of 17. May of a hard frost in 1794— I have so many things to do, before next Thursday week when I must depart for Washington, that I fear I shall do not one of them— I have not even time to select the most urgent of the calls upon me, or to make such arrangement of my private affairs as may extricate them from confusion, in the event of any sudden unexpected accident to myself.

His mother has a Letter from her at Philadelphia on her way home— The review of the case of the Antelope harrassed me all the morning; for if I wait the morning through, I cannot perform the task, and the day is lost.— Mr. Asa French, and Mr Benjamin V. French were here from the town of Braintree— The Inhabitants of that Town have determined to have a fair copy made of their old Record book of Births, Marriages and Deaths from the incorporation of the town in 1640 to 1776.— The book of which my father had a copy made in 1823.— I turned to the entries in my Diary of 25 Septr. and 1. October of that year, and found the record of my visits to Mr Wales then the Town Clerk of Braintree, and of our discovery then of that book— He had the copy of it made shortly after— It was then in poor condition, and is now so defaced and mutilated that they find difficulty in making out a fair copy of it— I received the week before the last a Letter from Mr B. V. French requesting the loan of my copy to assist them in making out theirs— I lent it to them accordingly this day, and with it the old original Record book of the town’s expenses, which I have had many year’s without knowing to whom it belonged— They offered me a receipt for the books, which however I did not require. But I told them that I should make a minute of their having received them this day, and that I should expect they would be returned when they should have used them at their convenience for the benefit of the town; which they promised. Mr B. V. French said that many of the inhabitants of the Town had been much disappointed, in the failure of the Resolutions of the three towns, inviting me to deliver a centennial address last May, and were yet very desirous that I should at some time convenient to myself deliver a historical discourse on the town of Braintree—and they had been appointed a Committee together with Coll. Minott Thayer to give me the invitation— I said I would very readily comply with it, if I could foresee the time when I should be able to prepare such a discourse;—but that was now out of the question—nor could I anticipate when it would be otherwise. He said that Coll. Minot Thayer could not come with them this day, being detained by the severe illness of his Sister who lives with him, and deeply distressed at the malady of his brother Doctor Stephen Thayer, who has recently become insane, and is now confined in the hospital so ill that a few days since he was not permitted to see him.

Josiah Adams was here this morning before breakfast— I paid him and took his receipt for 20 dollars which I had received for him from the Commissioner of Patents at Washington— He says that last Evening they organized a fire department, for which they have purchased a second hand engine, as good as new, for 400 dollars, which cost new 650— The Ladies of Quincy are to hold a Fair on the 17th. of June to raise money to ornament the cemetery of the first Congregational Church; and there is a plan for enlarging it, and removing the Town and school house; but this is not definitively fixed— Mr Townsend is a young man formerly of Salem, now of New-York— He wants a place of Clerk, or weigher in the Custom house of that city, and brought a Letter of warm recommendation of him from Leverett Saltonstall, endorsed by Rufus Choate— He desired also my endorsement, which I declined to give on the rule which I have generally observed.— The young man is of respectable appearance, and very well bred— He is a total stranger to me, yet said he had come from New-York, for the single purpose of obtaining my signature to the recommendations by Mr Saltonstall and Mr Choate— He asked me if I thought Mr Webster would recommend him— I said perhaps he might; but he would tell him that the office was not at the disposal of his Department— Elihu Thayer came to enquire respecting a pension claim of his mother Phebe, widow of Timothy Thayer.— He had been here on the 9th. of last November for the same purpose, and I took minutes for enquiry of the Commissioner of Pensions. But of what I did my recollection is not distinct, and I have not with me, the answer of J. L. Edwards the Commissioner, concerning the case— Mr Elihu Thayer will call again before my departure for Washington— John Leary was here this Evening with his account of Administration regularly drawn up. I urged him to send a copy of the inventory to his father and to remit 100 dollars more to him by the first Steamer, which he promised to do— Mr Beale and his daughter Caroline paid us an evening visit— I had hoped to finish this day my review of the case of the Antelope; but shall have at least two days more of work with it— I despatched short Letters to R. Peters and to the Boston Mercantile Library Association, and wrote this Evening to S. L. Southard and to Mrs Mary Derby at Medfield. "

There was great encroachment on my time, by an invitation to attend an examination of the school of the Revd William M Cornell at 10. this morning— I took the occasion however to visit Mr and Mrs John Greenleaf, whom it was almost surprizing that I should find alive; but who are in comparatively better health than when I last saw them last autumn— He is blind, deaf, paralytic, and nearly four score— She is but three months younger than I am, and has lived through greater hardships.— At Mr Cornell’s school I found Captain Whitney, Mr Brigham, and several orthodox clergymen as visitors, and about 20 boys and nine girls as pupils, under examination, the boys in Greek, Latin and English Grammar arithmetic and algebra. The girls in English grammar, poetry and belles Lettres— From the moment I entered the chamber Mr Cornell put the examination wholly upon me, and in parsing the Greek and Latin I wanted a little of the facilities acquired by the Canon Gil Perez in teaching Latin to his nephew Gil Blas— The Boys passed a tolerable examination, but their pronuntiation both of Greek and Latin was barbarous and the teacher himself appeared to have no conception of prosody, or of rhythmical quantities. But I did not tell him of it, being unwilling to mortify him in the presence of his school— At noon I left him after a few words of approbation and encouragement to his scholars which I spoke at his request— Immediately after dinner I had visits from Mr Stone and Mr Sayles, persons connected with the manufactures at Lowell, and much concerned for the prospects of that interest under the present administration. I feel an utter distrust of the principles of John Tyler a Virginian nullifier, now acting as President of the United States, and no confidence in the principles or belief in the sincerity of his Secretary of State— Between them and the manufacturing interest my position is so perilous that I am strongly inclined to refuse the office of Chairman of the Committee of Manufactures, and to propose to the Speaker whoever he may be to place me on the naval Committee— The confidence of these Gentlemen in the present administration, is not more sanguine than my own.— They are very anxious for the passage of my bill of the last Congress for the suppression of frauds on the revenue; of which there is now little chance.— Mrs Henshaw, with Harriet Welsh—her nephew Dr Thomas Welsh, and her Sister Bailey’s daughter Harriet were here. Thomas Welsh has received a Warrant for examination as an assistant Surgeon in the Navy, but will not be 21. till next August, and therefore cannot undergo the examination next month— He wishes to have his examination postponed for two years, to pass 1 1/2 year of the interval at Paris. I sent to Mr George Bancroft the Portrait of T. Jefferson, my father’s Letter to Nathan Webb. of 12 October 1755. and sheets of his journal in August and December 1765. "

Captain Percival of the Navy who now resides at Dorchester came this morning to request my attention to a Bill before Congress relating to Pursers in the Navy—reported by Mr John Reed from the Committee on naval affairs, but left without action of the house upon it at the late Session of Congress— It was founded on a memorial from a number of Seamen, praying for an increase of their pay, and complaining of abuses in the charges of Pursers— Mr Reed did not present the memorial but introduced the Bill. Captain Percival stated to me numerous cases of gross abuses in the charges of pursers, and said the Bill if passed would prevent them in future— He spoke also of impositions and frauds upon the public, by collusive practices between Navy Agents and Store keepers; and said that several Navy Agents in the course of four or five years had passed from poverty to opulence upon salaries of 2200 dollars a year. The present Navy Agent is Leonard Jarvis: but a new appointment is expected, and of the several candidates he warmly recommended a young man named Rogers, perfectly honest and having property sufficient to guard him from the temptation of becoming suddenly rich upon rapine— I requested Captain Percival to make a statement in writing, as far as he thought proper of what he had now communicated to me, and to furnish me with a copy of the memorial from the Seamen which he had now with him, which he promised to do, and I promised to devote to the subject in Congress, all the attention in my power. Percival himself is not without imputations, prepossessing against him as a reformer; and his representations must be received with a grain of salt— But they lead to extensive enquiry, and to confirm my desire to escape from topics as ungrateful to me as they are dangerous— Mr Hartshorn is a travelling Clock-cleaner and mender who cleaned both our Clocks, of the kitchen, and the western chamber entry, and new hung their weights, the suspending cords of which had broken, and drop’d them. He said they had been eaten off by moths; but I thought it was a flaw in the cord— Isaac Hull Adams and his sister Elizabeth spent the Evening. She left Washington on the morning of the fast day; and after passing a few days at Philadelphia reached home last Evening, in good health and Spirits. Charles went to Boston, and returned to dine— I visited my Nursery, seminary and garden the summer weather of the last two days has covered with blossoms the peach, plum and cherry trees, and opened those of the apples and pears— A chill east-wind this day arrests vegetation.

I omitted to mention the day before yesterday two persons both named Samuel Thomas, father and Son who came to enquire whether the son could not obtain the appointment of Inspector of the Customs for this and the adjoining towns—a useless office to which Dr William Duggan was first appointed by the late collector Bancroft, for use as an electioneering tool. Governor Lincoln has removed him, and now there are scores of Candidates for his place.— I told them that I thought they were too late with their application now, and that I had already declined recommending others. Heard Mr Lunt this morning; from 2. Peter 1.5. And besides this giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge— A dissertation upon the natural progress of the Christian graces—Faith, virtue—knowledge, and upon the imperfection of character of those who possess only two of the three qualities; such as Faith and virtue without knowledge, or virtue and knowledge: Faith being essential as the foundation of the whole, and virtue and knowledge, as successive additions to it— At the close of the Discourse Mr Lunt gave a summary narrative of the Apocryphal book of Tobit, which he considered as an allegorical fable; representing the ordinary vicissitudes, temptations and trials of human life from childhood to the grave. His afternon text was from 2. Peter 2.15. [“]Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness. 16. but was rebuked for his iniquity[”]—a very interesting Discourse on the character and history of Balaam—one of the most extraordinary parts of the old Testament. Treated admirably by Bishop Butler, and now very ingeniously by Mr Lunt; but there is yet one point of view, in which it needs illustration to me— Balaam is represented as a true prophet—sent for by Balak king of Moab to defend his country from being overrun and conquered by the Israelites, by cursing them— Balaam consults the Lord is forbidden to go and refuses to go.— Balak sends for him again—he consults the Lord again—who bids him to go, but to speak what he shall tell him, and yet sends an angel to arrest him, and gives voice to the Ass to remonstrate with him, and yet lets him go.— Balaam finally pronounces a magnificent blessing upon Israel, instead of the curse which Balak sent for him to deliver, and there it ends.—except that we are afterwards told that he gave evil counsel to the children of Israel, and that they slew him with the sword. Mr De Grand came out from Boston, and dined, and spent the day with us. Mrs Mary Flinn a Sister of Jeremy Leary, came and told me a grievous story of her having been married against her will to a man who cannot maintain her—and complaining of her brother John. "

Mr Curtis came over from Roxbury, and we employed a couple of hours together in preparing Letters, as Executors of Ward N. Boylston to Petty Vaughan, London, and to R. M. Cutler, Guysborough Nova-Scotia— I wrote, and we both signed a Letter to Mr Vaughan stating our objections to executing the Indenture of Release and Indemnity sent out by him— It embraces supposed claims in this Country with which he has nothing to do. Claims of the town of Boston settled by Mr W. N. Boylston, in his lifetime— It includes also John Lane Boylston as a party to the Indenture, and Mr Vaughan sent even a renunciation of claim to be signed by J. L. Boylston’s two sons, which we consider as also quite superfluous. A release from us equivalent to a receipt in full of all monies received by him and paid over to us on account of claims of W. N. Boylston’s estate upon the Executors of Lee is all they have a right to require of us, and that we are willing to give— The claim for insurance on the ship Malabar, belongs to the Estate of Thomas Boylston, and we wrote to Mr Vaughan that I should write to him further on the subject— Mr Curtis will take copies of Letters for duplicates, and send them to me, before my departure for Washington— We authorised Mr R. M. Cutler to sue out Ejectments from Mr Boylston’s Lands, and to sell them— Morning visit from Revd. Peter Whitney whose second daughter, Mary, was recently married to Richard Cranch Greenleaf who keeps a dry goods shop in Boston— Mr Whitney has three sons and two daughters all of whom have now left him Solitary.— Deacon Spear was also here and made some enquiries about Henry and William Hope— He and some others in this town have taken a fancy that they are relatives of the once famed Henry Hope, and have expectancies of Fortune from him. Mr Edward Cranch of Cincinnati, with his recently married wife and her Sister were here on a short visit this afternoon— They merely called at Mr Appleton’s, here at Mrs T. B. Adams’s and at Mr John Greenleaf’s—and returned to Boston— Visits from Mrs Torrey, a daughter of Henry Warren, and Miss Torrey her daughter. Then Mr Rice called with a new Petition concerning his contract, but without the testimony of the late Collector Bancroft who he has promised it. We spent the Evening at Mrs T. B. Adams’s— Mrs. Morton and Miss Sarah Apthorp were there— Mr and Mrs Lunt and his brother’s wife. Mrs Morton spoke of her claims—Yazoo, and French spoliations before 1800— We took her home. "

Mr Cornell called this morning and enquired if I proposed to place either of my grandsons at school in this town I told him that my grandsons were at the disposal of their father, who I believed did not propose to send either of his sons to school here. He said he should be glad to take them; but his pupils are not in very good repute— Deacon James Newcomb, brought a Tankard with an engraving upon it purporting that it was the gift of John Quincy Esquire to the Church, but no arms. Deacon Spear was afterwards here and brought a cup, inscribed, the gift of Edmund Quincy Esqr. 23. February 1737/8 which was the day of his death— The town meeting was held yesterday, and several votes were passed for building a new Stone town-house, and enlarging the burying ground. After all which there was a vote to suspend all further action of the town upon the subject till next April— Mr Brown one of the Selectmen of the town Yesterday committed suicide, and was found dead in his barn with his throat cut— He was much esteemed and his death has occasioned a great shock; being altogether unexpected. The Coroner’s jury returned a verdict of suicide in a temporary fit of insanity— Susan Tufts was here this afternoon, and Mr William Wright who came out from Boston with his daughter. He gave me sundry papers relating to the transactions in the settlement of accounts between the Government of the United States and the Commonwealth’s Bank of this City.— Mr Wright had a memorial upon this subject before the last Congress, and wishes it called up at that which is about to meet— There is a Report of the Secretary of the Treasury Woodbury, and another to the Senate of this State among the papers— Mr Bond who was chairman of a Committee of the House of Representatives on Wright’s Memorial, in the last Congress is not a member elect of the 27th. Elihu Thayer called again concerning the pension claim of his mother Phebe Thayer— I have found none of the papers relating to the case, and cannot recall to mind what was done with it last Winter by the Commissioner of Pensions.

In the anxiety of long protraction I devoted to it the whole of this day, and finished it in a hurried manner, so that it is not yet in a condition to be sent to the printers. A scene of ludicrous distress ensued, for after finishing, I proceeded to collect together the printed slips of newspapers and the manuscript sheets of my revisal, when the first and most essential of the manuscripts with four of the fifteen slips between its leaves was missing—and I had a regular hunt for them of about two hours in a state of nervous excitement at my own carelessness, as blamable as the carelessness itself— Mrs Charles was all the time assisting me in the search, and Charles was packing my trunk in the operation of which he finally found my missing papers, under a load of books on the bed.— Mr Lunt called and returned to me, my manuscript version of the Psalms, and the Book containing the Sabbath morning hymn, and he gave me a list of my productions which he proposes to introduce into his new hymn book. He takes the whole or parts of about ten of my Psalms—the Plymouth hymn of 22 December 1803. written the year before. the Sunday hymn; written at Ealing in 1816— The hour-glass, written at Meridian hill in the Spring of 1829. sung at the centennial Church celebrationSeptember 1839.—and two of the Stanza written in sickness in 1831— He does not take the whole Book of Psalms— Very few whole Psalms— But short Psalms, and fragments of some long ones, all as hymns intermingled with the others in portions just sufficient for singing at one time each— I questioned the expediency of abandoning the old practice of using the whole book of Psalms, and printing it separately from the collection of hymns.— But this is now the fashion— I had a long conversation with Mr Lunt upon the institution by David making instrumental and vocal music a part of the daily weekly and monthly religious worship.—and I proposed to him to deliver a discourse upon the moral and literary character of the Book of Psalms, illustrated by the history of David’s institution—his composition of many of the Psalms—the lost Songs of Solomon— The Psalms of Asaph, and the lyric succession down; to the deep and melancholy pathos of the 137th. bewailing the Babylonian captivity— And discussing the influence of this institution not only upon the Jewish Nation but upon Christianity, Christendom and civilized man— He said it would be a good subject for a preliminary discourse to his hymn book. Alpheus Spear, John A. Green and John Leary were here successively this Evening.— I referred Spear and his business to my Son. Mr Green left a Letter containing a question concerning the duty of a moderator at a Town Meeting which I had not time to answer— Leary is a Sharper. Isaac H. Adams and Elizabeth were here. "

Rising two hours before the time when they breakfast at the house where we lodged, I opened my trunks, took out my diary and abridged as much as I was able its arrears— At 7 we breakfasted and immediately after proceeded to the Rail road Office in Market Street— Took tickets for Baltimore, and reached that City after 7 hours of locomotion from half past 7. to half past 2 p.m.—the ride is tedious although so rapid.— M’Keon who comes in as an opposition member from the city of New-York had a deal box of a foot and a half cubic measure containing a new fashioned Lady’s hat directed to Miss Tyler, to the care of John Tyler President of the United States, and M’Keon lugg’d it along as if it had been a casket of jewels for his sweet heart— He was talking politics all the way, and he told me, he should raise the question of the constitutional right of Mr Tyler to assume the title of President of the United States— At Baltimore some of our company dined at one of the two taverns opposite the Railway depot; but I had found there indifferent fare heretofore, and preferred waiting till I got home— The sky was clear, and the thermometer too high to walk about the city; so I took a ticket for Washington, and wandered about the purlieus of the yard and stables of the depot, about an hour. at half past 3. took my Seat in one Car of the train, and saw them fill up like a flowing tide. At 4 O’Clock Mr Henry Clay of Kentucky came in, and we started. Mr Dixon a Senator U.S. from Rhode-island, Mr Brockway a member of the House from Connecticut, Mr Pendleton from Ohio, increased the number of the members of Congress—and at the relay house 9 miles from Baltimore towards Washington Mr. Proffit of Indiana came in, and at the junction of the Annapolis road Mr. John Leeds Kerr a Senator from Maryland— We landed at Washington at half past six, Sun more than half an hour high— I found my carriage waiting for me, and reached home before Sunset, rejoicing to meet again my family, in comfortable health. 6 hours from Quincy to Stonington—15 to New-York—6 to Philadelphia 7. to Baltimore. and 2 1/2 to Washington— In all 36 1/2 hours of six and a half hours of which the Stonington fog was to be responsible— I was only 34 traveling hours in going from Washington to Boston— After a temperate dinner I received visits this Evening from Captain Robert M. Buchanan now here upon furlough—Mary E. E. Cutts and Mr Gideon Granger, who has taken part of Mr Matthew St. Clair Clark’s new house— And now with gratitude for the preservation during my absence of my family and my own write as ever fervent and penitential prayer for their continued happiness, and a heavenly guide for myself— "

                "text": "30. V. Sunday—  Whitsunday— I attended public worship this morning at the Unitarian Church, and heard Mr Bulfinch preach from Philippians 4.8. “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” Mr Bulfinch took only the last words of the verse for his text, and considering these things as comprehending the sum of all religion, made his sermon merely an earnest exhortation to thoughtfulness on the subject of religion, and of fervent and affectionate remonstrance against religious indifference, inattention and neglect— The discourse therefore ran into generalities and preceptive common-place.— These things on which St. Paul with feeling so intense urges the Philippians to think are the things previously enumerated in the verse—the true, the honest, the just, the pure, the lovely, the gracious—virtue and praise—the καλον και αγαθον of Plato these are the things which Paul teaches his readers to bear in mind—to have them always in their thoughts—and how profoundly they were in his own thoughts is sufficiently demonstrated by the redundancy of repetition in the charge.— What a lesson of morality, rather than of religion— If men would but habitually and incessantly think of these things, how small would be the calendar of crime—how much more secure would be the condition of men in Society— The great majority of all crimes are committed in drunkenness or intoxication, which disables a man from thinking of these things.— Many are committed for want of education without which it is scarcely possible to think of abstract moral virtue and praise— The proportion of crimes committed from the wants of nature is very small, and they are not the crimes which strike at the existence of Society— But it is the duty of every one and of course my own, according to his respective condition to think of these things— I had Letters for judge Cranch, his daughter Mrs Elizabeth Dawes, and Mrs Greenough, from Quincy, which I delivered to them after Church.— Met Mr Seaton the Mayor, who told me something of the proceedings of the whig Caucus last Evening. 100 members present. 73 for John White of Kentucky— All to vote for him— 51. votes for F. O. J. Smith of Maine as Clerk, but the minority for Matthew St. Clair Clarke do not hold themselves bound to vote for Smith— I had some hesitation about voting for Clarke, for whom I have always voted before—but certain rumours are in circulation respecting his habits which have brought me to a pause— Seaton with whom I went into the Intelligencer Office assured me that those rumours were greatly exaggerated, and that whatever occasion there may have been for any of them heretofore there is none now— Robert Buchanan dined with us— Afternoon Church at St. John’s— Mr Hawley Read prayers for Whitsunday Evening and Mr Armstrong of Wheeling preached from 1. Peter 4.17. [“]For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel of God?” Mr Cutts and his daughter here this Evening— "

Mr Clarke called upon me this morning, and alluding to the conversation I had yesterday with Mr Seaton, of which Seaton had information, he protested to me that there was no foundation for the slanderous rumours about the irregularity of his habits— I am compelled to take his promises and Seaton’s assurances upon trust; and to pray that I may not be deceived and disappointed. Next came Mr Markoe from the Secretary of State’s office charged by Mr Webster to answer a note of complaint from the Spanish Minister, about the liberation of the Amistad Africans. Mr Webster wants information upon the subject, and Mr Markoe is in a panic for fear of offending Spain— I gave him Mr Baldwin’s argument in the case of the Amistad, and desired him to advise Mr Webster not on this occasion to truckle to Spain— Then came Messrs. Slade, Giddings and Gates, who have been in the Caucus on Saturday Evening, and had tried to make a vote for Millard Fillmore, but found a division in the minority of the Northern whigs; the Pennsylvanians claiming the vote for Joseph Lawrence of that State— Between them the Anti-Slavery vote shrank into nothing, and they remained with only one vote more and mine to vote for Lawrence. Then came another Committee John C. Clark, Child and Foster to request me to make the motion in the house for posthumous honours to the late President Harrison, which I promised to do— Franzoni and then Mrs Renner and her daughter came to solicit sympathy and assistance, and Mrs Renner has a petition before Congress for a claim, which she commended to my care— At Noon I rode to the Capitol H.R.U.S. At the roll call by the Clerk of late House, Hugh A. Garland, 227. members answered to their names. John White of Kentucky, was chosen Speaker at the first viva voce vote—he had 121 votes John W. Jones 84. Henry A. Wise 8. Joseph Lawrence 5. of which mine was one—Clifford 1. W. Cost Johnson 1. Wise’s. Briggs 1.— Borden’s— White was sworn by Lewis Williams—took the Chair and made a namby pamby speech about his incompetency and his impartiality— Then came the choice of Clerk—4 votes to make an election— Matthew St. Clair Clark had 38. 51. 91. and 128. of 224. and was chosen. Hugh A. Garland the late clerk, at first 80 and less and less, at each subsequent vote— F. O. J. Smith the caucus candidate had 91 votes at the first trial, but fell off each time afterwards— Wise moved a resolution to adopt the rules of the last House for ten days, and in the Mean time to appoint a select Committee of 9. to report a revisal of the rules.— Underwood moved an amendment of long twist— I moved to amend, by inserting except the 21st. which is hereby rescinded. Question not taken— Adjourn’d to 11. A.M. "

M’Cormick, who died a few days after I went home in April— I had placed him in the Department of State on the 1st. of January 1818. and he remained there undisturbed till his death. But Homer says Mr Webster had promised the place to a Classmate of his at College named Bingham; so that Homer’s tenure is barely momentary, and he says the Secretary of the Treasury, Ewing has not treated him fairly; for he promised him an office to commence on the 1st. of May, and then disappointed him— He was arrested in the detail of his grievances by Mr Force and Mr Nourse—who came as a Committee from the Columbian College, with a written proposal to pay the annual interest due on their bond to me, and 3000 dollars of the principal, provided I will receive it in such funds as they have received—that is in depreciated Bank Bills— I told them I wanted the 3000 dollars to pay a debt of the same amount, and if my creditor would take what they proposed to pay me— They assented to this— I sent for Antoine, and enquired of him if he would take the bills or corporation stock in payment— He said he would enquire as to the value of corporation stock and give me an answer— He afterwards came again and said he would take corporation stock at 94 per cent, with the discount for the depretiation of the Bills— Morning visit with Messrs. Slade and Gates of a Mr Moore of the State of New-York residing on Lake Champlain, and Mr Tomlinson— By all this and a call of Charity for a coloured man named Lancaster, I was belated a quarter of an hour at the Capitol— Walter Hellen rode thither with me, and when I entered the Hall, the house had determined to take by yeas and nays on my amendment to Underwood’s amendment to Wise’s Resolution to adopt the rules of the last house of Representatives— The Speaker was in the act of ordering the call of the roll when I reached my seat— I addressed the House about three quarters of an hour in support of my amendment— Slade rose to speak, but Sergeant from the joint Committee appointed to wait on the President asked to make a Report— The debate on the Rules was accordingly suspended. Sergeant reported that the President had informed the Committee that he would make a communication in writing to both houses immediately— The Message was then delivered by his Son Robert Tyler, and read by the Clerk—10,000 copies extra to be printed, after much debate for more. Pickens moved a Resolution that the seats should be numbered and drawn by lot; which after a debate of two hours and numerous proposed amendments, was laid on the table by tellers 105 to 102— Graham gave notice that he would to morrow ask leave to introduce a Bill to repeal the Sub-treasury law—adjourned to 12 to morrow— Mr Beverley Allen, brought a Letter of introduction from John Scott of Missouri— T. B. Johnson Kavasales and Robert M. Buchanan here this Evening. "

IV:15 Wednesday  Mr Homer was here this morning and concluded the narrative of his grievances in failing to obtain a permanent Office in the Department of the Treasury or of State. He wants my influence to assist him— That would not avail him; but he has more powerful influence than mine at work than mine in his favour, and he will not be finally disappointed— Morning visits from Mr Barnard, with two of his Colleagues, new members of the house— Greig and Van Rensselaer— Greig is a Scotchman; representing Mr Granger’s District, and elected to supply his place— He told me that he had been acquainted with Mrs Agnes Porter late of London, so warmly the friend of my wife and me when we were last in England, and so kindly remembering us after we came home while she lived— A person by the name of Henry Matthews from the Western part of New-York came and announced himself as a Candidate for the office of Sergeant at arms to the House of Representatives. At the Office of the National Intelligencer neither of the Editors Gales or Seaton was there. I pointed out to the foreman the egregious error in the report of my speech yesterday, in support of my motion to rescind the 21st. rule of the last House— I sent to the Clerk’s table, and caused to be read the Resolutions of the Legislature of Massachusetts, against the identical rule. After the House adjourned yesterday I called at the Office, expressly to state my solicitude for the correctness of the report and to request that the Resolutions should be published as part of my speech, which Seaton promised to do; but by a ludicrous mistake, published another set of Resolutions, relating to Slavery but having no reference to the rule whatever. The foreman promised that the error should be corrected in the Country paper and in the daily paper of to-morrow.— I spoke on the same subject to Mr Seaton, at the Mayor’s Office, and afterwards to Mr Gales— I called at the Patriotic Bank and received 316.75. for the Franklin Insurance Office dividend, in Virginia Bank Bills, as Charles J. Nourse told me, at 4 1/2 per Cent discount— I told Mr Rothwell, Treasurer of the Columbia College, that my creditor declined receiving payment otherwise than in Specie or its equivalent, and I must therefore do the same— But I said he would take corporation Stock in payment if that would suit the college— He said he would consult the Directors and let me know their decision on Friday: At the house: the names of the Committee of one Member from each State, on my Resolution honorary to the memory of President Harrison, were announced—mine as Chariman— James Cooper then announced the decease on the 10th. of May of Charles Ogle, late a member of the House, with an appropriate Eulogy, and the usual Resolutions. Adjourned to 11. A.M. to-morrow. Evening calls and visits from Miss Cutts, Charles J. Ingersoll Mr. Carusi, and Captain Buchanan. "

Mr Homer had mentioned to me yesterday, a fellow lodger of his named Senter from Western New-York who was desirous of being introduced to me—to which I consented. Mr Homer came with him accordingly this morning and introduced him and left him with me. After a short conversation, upon Mr Giddings of Ohio’s coming in with judge Morfitt of that State, he withdrew, saying that he would occasionally drop in, to see me— At the House, the discussion upon the adoption of the Rules of the house in the last Congress, was resumed, on my amendment to Underwood’s amendment to Wise’s motion— Wise accepted Underwood’s amendment, and then, at great length answered my argument in support of my amendment— He was followed by William Cost Johnson, who made a plausible and temperate speech in support of his speech—brought up again as he did at the time of the adoption of the rule, what he represents as a precedent—the yeas and nays on a motion to lay on the table a motion to receive an abolition petition, on the 18th. of January 1836 for which I voted— It was to lay on the table for that day to be taken up again and be decided immediately after, as it was by receiving it— Johnson committed the gaucherie also of saying that he had a Letter from the acting President Tyler, declaring his approbation of the Rule— I called on him to produce the Letter— He said he had it not here, and that it was written last year when the rule was adopted— Slade moved two amendments to my amendment, but afterwards abandoned one of them—only retaining that of striking out that part of my amendment which requires the rescinding of the 21st. rule. Samson Mason proposed as a compromise to adopt all the rules, for this Session, and Horace Everett had some other concession to propose the previous question was vociferously called for from various quarters— I asked of the justice of the house to allow me the opportunity of replying to Wise and Johnson—and of assigning my reasons for not accepting Slade’s amendment to mine— The vote on the previous question was taken by tellers and resulted 75 to 95— This, according to the Speaker’s construction of Parliamentary Law; laid over the whole subject to another day.— The Senate had concurred in the appointment of a joint-committee, to honour the memory of the late President Harrison, and appointed a Committee of 5 on their part—Bayard Chairman— As Chairman on the part of the house I went into the Senate chamber, and agreed with Bayard, that the Committee should meet on Saturday next at Noon in the Vice-Presidents chamber; of which I gave notice to all the members on the part of the House— The report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the Finances was received. It proposes a Bank. Wise moved a call for the plan, and a Committee to report upon it. Much debate and confusion— Adjourned to next Monday 11. A.M. Evening visits from Fendall, Winthrop, J. C. Gray and M’Curdy— "

IV:15— Friday  Morning calls from Dr Todsen and Mr Kavasales. both applicants for office, and both likely to be disappointed— Todsen brought back my French translation of the Silesian Letters, and expects to inflame my zeal in his favour by the great interest he has taken in reading them— Notwithstanding which I fear he will not obtain his office— Nor will Mr Kavasales be more successful. I went to the Capitol to see and converse with the Speaker of the house, but he was neither at his chamber there; nor at his lodgings at Dr Mayo’s— He was gone to the races.— In the Congress Library I found in the extra Globe of 19. January 1836. ample evidence, to brand the dirty trick of W. C. Johnson in taking up a list of yeas and nays of the day before, and for which I voted, as a precedent for refusing to receive abolition petitions.— I afterwards found further evidence in Gales and Seatons Register of Debates; and only pray that in exposing this knavish practice I may be enabled to preserve my temper— I paid a visit to the acting President John Tyler and had a conversation with him upon the condition and prospects of the Smithsonian fund— The Secretary of the Treasury Ewing has not communicated to him my Letter of 19. April last, nor the report nor any of the documents which I sent him with it— When I went into the room where Mr Tyler received me I saw H. A. Wise in the back portico, facing the Potowmac, but he did not come in, while I was there— My next call was on the Secretary of the Navy. I enquired for the correspondence on the Records of the Department, concerning a Mandate of the Supreme Court to S. L. Southard Secretary of the Navy of 14. Septr. 1825. in the care of the Antelope—a certificate from the same Court of March and a mandate of May 1827. but none such was to be found— In the case of Dr Thomas Welsh the Secretary assured me that he should have the privilege of passing an examination for an appointment as an assistant surgeon in the navy, instead of the present year, he not being of age till next August.— He gave me to understand that Kavasales would not receive appointment as chaplain in the Mediterranean Squadron, because he is not an Anglo-saxon.— I read to him the Letter of 3. April last to me from Clement Bennett an Ex-Midshipman, dismissed from the Navy, and claiming to be restored. He said the case had been examined and the claim rejected— At the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury with reference to the application of Samuel N. Miller for an appointment as Lieutenant of a Revenue Cutter, he said there was a redundancy of such officers already— 14 Cutters. 18. Captains 22 Lieutenants— Visits from Mr Wood and Mr Weldon a Candidate for the chaplain of the house. Mrs Thornton, Mrs Talbot and her daughter here this Evening. "

                "text": "5. IV:30. Saturday—  Bath and swim in the Potomac river.  Summer has come to claim his own—from the raw frigid North-eastern winds. I have made a sudden plunge into the burning atmosphere of the tropics. I rode in the barouche to my old bathing haunt under the high bluff half-way between the mouth of the Tiber and the bridge, which I had not visited since the Summer of 1838. and very seldom since September 1828— The bed of the river continues to encroach on this northern side of the strand— The large old trees which formerly stood on the banks have been uprooted by the tides, and all swept away. The bluff sapped beneath by the frequent washings of the Springs tides has become top-heavy, and masses of the clay have broken down, in heaps washed away again by the tides— I took the bath on a rising tide; swam about ten minutes and walked home— Morning visits from Messrs. Randall, Osborne, Toland and Rodney, and cards from Messrs. W. S. Hastings, Gates and Chittenden— At noon I attended at the meeting of the joint Committee on the tokens of respect to the memory of the late President William Henry Harrison, in the chamber of the Vice-President— The Committee on the part of the Senate were Bayard of Delaware, Prentiss of Vermont, Benton of Missouri, Archer of Virginia, and Walker of Mississippi of whom Archer and Walker were absent; of the House the Committee consisted of one member from each State, only two of whom were absent— Mr Bayard Chairman of the Senates Committee, proposed two Resolutions similar to those adopted on the decease of James Madison.—and they passed unanimously without debate. There was much discussion upon a third Resolution for a grant of money to the widow of General Harrison, which was adopted not unanimously, leaving the sum in blank— The Chairman of the Committee on the part of the house was instructed to prepare the bill and report it to the house. Something was said about an Eulogy, to be delivered before both houses, but none such having been pronounced upon Mr Madison, no formal proposition for it was now made— The Committee adjourned without day— At the City Hall I left at the Registers Office of the Orphan’s Court, John Leary’s account of administration of his brother Jeremy’s effects; and Mary Flynn’s affidavit to her claim for money lent— Neither judge nor Register was there. Mr Rothwell paid me 3000 dollars of principal and 684:64. interest on the bond of the Columbian College, in orders on Corcoran and Riggs, from whom I received the money in gold. I sent for Giusta and paid him my note of 5. July 1836. 3000 dollars, and 11. Months interest 137.50. Miss Cutts and her brother here this Evening— "

                "text": "6. V. Sunday.  Trinity Sunday. Morning worship at the second Presbyterian Church— Two other clergymen besides Mr Wood were there— One of whom was Mr Welton who lately called on me with Mr Wood— Of the name of the other I was not informed. He made the prayers, and baptised Mr Wood’s infant daughter, whom he himself accompanied by his wife, presented— The name given to her was Emmeline Merwin, and before administering the rite the minister gave a succinct account of the origin of the institution.— He said the Abrahamic, the Mosaic and the Christian Church were one. That the Covenant of God was with Abraham, and its token was the rite of circumcision— That to this institution, Moses added that of the passover; and that both had been adapted to the Christian dispensation by substituting baptism for circumcision, and the communion of the Lord’s supper for the passover— Then he said that baptism was the signal of admission to the Christian Church and reminded the Parents of the obligations of duty which they contracted for their child in offering her for this admission.— After which he took the child in his arms, and baptised her in the form of direct address to herself— Emiline Merwin I baptise thee, in the name of the father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost—amen! Mr Welton preached from 1. Peter 4.18. “And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly, and the sinner appear?” The manner of the preacher was earnest and affectionate the theme solemn and awful— The terrors of the judgment day— But it is the hacknied common-place of Calvinism, the pathos of which is lost upon me— That the righteous are saved in the future world I have no doubt, although the best may have much to answer for. Man can rely upon no merits of his own, but on the mercy of a God, whose tender mercies are over all his works— My wife attended, and took the communion at St. John’s Church: at which there was no evening service— Captain Buchanan dined and spent the Evening here, and Walter Hellen was also here this Evening.— I attended after dinner at Dr. Laurie’s church where a young man whom I knew not, preached from 2. Peter 3.9. [“]The Lord is not slack concerning his promise; as some men count slackness: but is long suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance”— The long-suffering of the Lord, was expounded, in very handsome language, pronounced very correctly and the auditory solemnly warned against too much reliance upon the long-suffering of the Lord— I prepared a short Letter to Joshua Leavitt, New-York.

I gathered up all the gold and silver that I had in the house, excepting some small change; and made up a purse of 700 dollars, which I took to the Treasury building and exchanged for 3 Treasury Notes one of 500 and 2 of 100 dollars each— They made a scruple at receiving the Sovereigns, because upon a late essay at the mint it had been found that they were 1/4 of a grain below the standard weight; being the exact allowance of the law, but which in recoining caused a loss of one cent a piece— As the amount was so small however the Treasurer consented to take my Sovereigns as I had received them at 4.85— Mr Kavasales came again this morning, still insisting, and still sangwine in the hope of receiving an appointment of Chaplain in the Navy. At 11. O’Clock the house met— Wise came over to my seat and asked me to yield him the floor, on the question about the rules, to read a precedent exactly in point, in the year 1800— I said certainly— The Speaker announced my amendment to the motion for adopting the rules of the last H.R. as the subject under consideration— I yielded the floor to Wise who with a great bustle of pomposity read his precedent of 1800 with all the yeas and nays, and it was in truth a precedent as strong as possible against him— As soon as he sat down, I rose and said— And the Mountain is delivered of its mouse—and in a speech of about three hours I replied to the Speeches of Wise and W. C. Johnson in opposition to mine—supporting my amendment— But as much as one third of the time in interruptions by Wise and Johnson with fresh speeches under colour of explanations— Thomas Butler King of Georgia replied to me with great bitterness and virulence— Millard Fillmore then moved the previous question, which the Speaker stated would be first on my amendment (merely “except the 21st”) (I had accepted Slade’s amendment, and struck out the rescinding clause) and then upon the Resolution to adopt the rules.— After much chicanery the previous question was carried, and the vote by yeas and nays on my amendment was carried 112 to 104. almost exclusively bond and free— After much struggling the question was carried to adopt the rules with the exception— Then a ragged question of precedence in business, in which Wise wrangled as usual, but which ended in the adoption of the order moved by Briggs that the Standing Committees of the house be now appointed with an additional select Committee of 9. moved by John Sergeant, on the currency— M’Keon moved a division of the question, and both parts of it were successively carried. I asked leave to make a report from the joint Harrison Committee, but in the confusion I was not heard. It was near half past six when the house adjourned to Noon to-morrow— I requested the Speaker not to appoint me on the Committee of Manufactures— He said he did not so intend— And asked if I had any objection to the Committee of Foreign Relations— I said no. Mr Giusta was here this Evening: and J. Pickering, Captain Buchanan and Dr Thomas. "

Mr Parker is a man who has lost a leg, and the wooden substitute which he wears being from long use worn out he wants to purchase a new one, and visits with certificates of his misfortune his need and his character members of Congress for voluntary contributions— Mrs Renner has a petition for a claim on account of some service of her husband, deceased— She was here before; when I desired her to get her petition drawn up in form, and promised to present it— She came now again with her daughter. Lawyer Key is to draw up her Petition. But as Congress will probably not act upon Petitions at this special Session—she reserves it now till the next winter Session, and desiring to go to Annapolis, to establish her daughter there in some profitable business, could not I accommodate her with a small sum in advance of what she may obtain on her claim? No. Well, could not I give her a trifle, ever so small, were it no more than five dollars, to pay for her journey to Annapolis, and the accomplishment of her business there? No. There came another woman with a basket over her arm, as going to market— She said she had four children, and not a cent to give them bread, and she asked for charity— This is an average specimen of the daily number and classes of beggars who beset members of Congress in this city. I went to the Orphan’s Court, with John Leary’s statement of his administration account, of his brother Jeremy’s estate and Mary Flynn’s claim and affidavit— The judge appeared willing to admit all the charges, and Mary Flynn’s demand, but he requires burdensome, troublesome, and expensive authentications. At the house an order was adopted to proceed immediately to the Election of Officers of the House, after the journal had been read, and the appointment of the standing Committees announced— Instead of the foreign Affairs which the Speaker told me he intended for me he has made Caleb Cushing, Chairman of that Committee, and me Chairman of the Committee of Indian Affairs— Saltonstall Chairman of the Committee of Manufactures—and he has placed me next to Sergeant on his currency Committee— The Election of Serjeant at arms was fiercely contested, and terminated in the choice of Eleazar Townsend of New-York. In the midst of the election C. J. Ingersoll moved a reconsideration of my amendment to the Resolution adopting the former rules.— Fornance moved a reconsideration of the Resolution adopting the rules of the former house with my amendment and Ezra Dean of Ohio moved a reconsideration of the order for the appointment of the Committees— The two Resolutions honorary to the memory of the late President Harrison were received from the Senate, and concurred in unanimously though not without difficulty in getting at the question— I introduced also the Bill from the same Committee. Adjourned to 12. to-morrow. Evening visit from Mr Miller. "

Mr Kavasales was here again this morning, but I had not had time to call on the Secretary of the Navy, and I promised I would as soon as possible— I called at the Orphan’s Court with Mary Flynn’s affidavit and a Massachusetts register for this year, with the name of John M. Gourgas, as a Justice of Peace, and the quorum in the County of Norfolk, to enquire if the judge would not take this and my own testimony as sufficient authentication of the fact, without putting the poor woman to the trouble and expense of procuring a certificate under the seal of the County Court. The register said he thought he might but the judge would hold Court again next Friday, when I might ascertain from him— I suddenly met in the Office Dr Tobias Watkins whom I had not seen since 1829. at Meridian hill—he being then in deep trouble, from which he has yet but partially emerged— I took him by the hand and enquired how he was; at which he seemed surprized and bewildered; but he shook my hand cordially, and said he was well— At parting we shook hands again but without saying any thing further— At the House great part of the day was consumed, in electing by nominal call, Joseph Follansbee, as Door-keeper. John W Hunter as Assistant Door-keeper; both these were cases of re-election, and both were contested by seven rival candidates— At last by unanimous consent M’Cormick was re-appointed Postmaster to the house by Resolution. J Sergeant then moved a Resolution (after the election of the Revd. J. W. French episcopalian as chaplain) for the appointment of Printer to the house to receive a compensation 20 per cent less than the prices fixed by the joint Resolution of 1819,—but Fornance and C. J. Ingersoll insisted upon the consideration of their respective motions to reconsider first my amendment to Wise’s Resolution for the adoption of the Rules, and secondly the Resolution itself adopting the rules with my amendment— Everett opposed the consideration of Ingersoll’s motion, as out of order, as it certainly was— But a Slave holding Speaker could not reject this new convert to the servile cause—and Wise, and Cost Johnson and King of Georgia, were all clamorous for hearing Ingersoll and he proceeded in an elaborate speech on three points—The African Slave trade—the internal Slave trade and Slavery—and the Right of Petition— He spoke nearly an hour on the first point the African Slave-trade; frequently interrupted by Botts as out of order, but sustained by Wise, Johnson and King and feebly resisted by the Speaker, who always finished by letting him go on— He enlarged the range of debate by bringing in the African Slave-trade; and I begged that he might be allowed to proceed in his own way—allowing others to reply— Between 5 and six a motion was made to adjourn and carried by yeas and nays— Thermometer over 90. Utterly impossible to read or write in the Evening. "

Thursday  The weather continues intensely warm, with alternations of blazing Sun and beclouded sultry calm— There was all this day a gentle northwestern breeze which made the heat supportable— I longed for the river bath but the tide, not being up before nine, in the morning, served not for my convenience to bathe before breakfast, and I have no other disposable time— Mr Kavasales was here twice, morning and Evening.—in the interval I had called on the Secretary of the Navy, Mr Badger, and delivered to him the recommendations of Mr Kavasales which he had placed in my hands.— I told him that if there was any particular objection to giving Kavasales an appointment in the Squadron, about to be despatched to the Mediterranean he would be glad to receive the appointment to serve upon any other station— That there was now a chaplain named Jones, serving on the West Indian squadron, to return home in the course of the present Summer who would then resign his office and leave a vacancy to be filled. Mr Badger said there could not possibly be presented stronger, or more respectable recommendations; but he gave me no encouragement to expect the appointment. I gave to the Secretary Mrs Cary’s Letter to him requesting the discharge of her son, now serving as an apprentice on board the Ohio line of Battle ship in the Mediterranean. He said they had been obliged to establish as a rule, the rejection of all such applications. I said it would perhaps be advisable to repeal the Law, authorising such enlistments—but asked a written answer to Mrs Cary’s application which he promised— I called upon Mr Frye, about the Marshal’s auction sale this day. of George Johnson’s lots 20 21. 22. and 23. Square 231—but was too late— It was half past 12. before I reached the house. C. J. Ingersoll resumed and in three hours concluded his speech, all at and against me. J. C. Clarke then moved the previous Question— He yielded however to the earnest and importunate solicitation of Thomas F. Marshall of Kentucky, upon his promise to renew it. Marshall then made a splendid two hours speech, at and against me, and closed by renewing the demand of the Previous Question— A motion was made to lay the whole subject on the table—lost by yeas and nays.— The previous question was then carried by yeas and nays and the question to reconsider the vote adopting my amendment to Wise’s motion for adopting the old rules—“except the 21st” was lost by yeas and nays 116 to 110.—a second deliverance as by fire— Wise then called up Fornance’s motion to reconsider the vote of the House adopting the old rules, with my amendment excluding the 21st. upon which he said he had a word to say. It was half past 5. O’Clock—he said he was ready to go on now, or to adjourn as it should please the house— A motion was immediately made to adjourn, and carried by yeas and nays— Mr Pope this morning visited our Ladies, with his niece Mrs Allen, daughter of his brother, Nathaniel Pope, her husband Mr Allen, and a friend of theirs Mr Churchill.

Gourgas, before whom it was taken, is a Justice of Peace in the County of Norfolk, Massachusetts, as authentication of the fact, instead of requiring that it should be attested under the seal of the County Court— I signed the certificate accordingly and took the affidavit with me together with a copy, furnished me of the inventory and appraisement returned of Jeremy Leary’s effects— At the house, Hiram P. Hunt a mellow whig member from New-York who occupies the seat immediately before mine gave notice of his intention to ask leave to bring in a bill to repeal the act of 2d. October 1837. to postpone the fourth instalment of deposite with the States— Hunt is a busy body Marplot in the morning, and always fuddled after dinner— The fourth instalment has been long since used up and wasted by the Van-Buren Administration, and it is too late to call for it now.— To raise money from the people, by taxation now, merely to deposite with the States, will not meet with much encouragement from Congress. But it will consume time— Sundry other members asked Wise to allow them a minute or two to offer resolutions, but he was biting his curb bit, and rudely refused. After much solicitation he permitted Botts to enquire of the Speaker, whether a reconsideration of the vote adopting the rules, would not annul all the proceedings of the House under the rules.—Without waiting for the Speaker’s answer Wise began in a tone, which I saw would break him down—Loud—vociferous. declamatory—furibund—he raved about the hell-hound of abolition, and at me as the leader of the abolitionists throughout the Union, for a full hour till his voice had broken into childish treble two or three times— Arnold of Tennessee came to my seat, and with deep earnestness intreated me not to reply to him, and I promised that I would not. Without abatement of his vehemence Wise came to speak of the controversy between the States of Virginia and New-York; and then his tone suddenly fell—he became bewildered in his argument; his voice failed him, he became ghastly pale said he felt himself unwell, sank into his chair and fainted. Several of his friends flew to his assistance, led him out of the Hall, and took him to his lodgings— The house postponed the further consideration of the Subject till to-morrow.— Then after a sufficient dose of Kinderhoek Chicanery, and an appeal by Atherton from a decision of the speaker, confirmed by a vote of nearly two to one Gales and Seaton, were elected Printers to the House by 134 viva voce votes— Blair and Rives had 75 votes, and Peter Force 6. Sergeant then offered a Resolution to restrict the action of the standing Committees, to the subjects mentioned in the President’s Message, which was debated till 4. O’Clock when the house adjourned. In the Evening Mr Edouart the man of shades, came and left with me full length profiles of my father, President Tyler and myself "

He thought that a Southern Planter with 500 slaves had 300 votes— Mr Osborne, a member of the house from Connecticut, brought with him Mr Bishop, an inventor of a mode of making cloth out of wool without spinning or weaving— He had with him some samples of his cloth— He has taken out here a patent for his invention—is going to England to obtain a patent there, and applies to me for Letters of recommendation— He presented to me, a recommendatory letter, addressed to Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and myself signed by Clark Bissell of Hartford, and countersigned by Timothy T. Merwin, Charles Isaacs and Thomas B. Butler, all strangers to me, mentioning his purpose of embarking for England and soliciting testimonials for him— I promised to give him a Letter to our Consul in London, Mr Aspinwall— At the House, Mr Wise was in his seat; but apparently very feeble, and his motion of reconsideration was again postponed till Monday— The real object of these postponements is to give time for the five members from Alabama to come in— Chapman came in two or three days since without waiting for his credentials— Another came in this day.— The Legislature of that State to secure a full jacobin representation changed their mode of election for members of the house from the District to the general ticket system— They are all of course slave dealers— The States were now called for Petitions; and beginning with Maine and were gone through. I presented none—abstaining purposely— But Mattocks of Vermont presented an abolition petition, which produced an immediate explosion.— The motion to receive it, was laid on the table— The Committee on the Rules, reported, that during the present Session, it shall be understood that objection is made to the reception of all petitions and the motion to receive shall be laid on the table— This report was not within the reference to the Committee, and Wise and his gang resisted its adoption by the house. So did I—only however by voting against it— I cannot agree to the exclusion of all petitions, with partial and favourite exceptions for a whole session— There were seven motions for adjournment taken by the yeas and nays and rejected— The report of the Committee was carried, and a motion to reconsider rejected— Evening with Cushing at his lodgings, and all the Massachusetts delegation in the house, but Hastings and Parmenter— Home at 11.

                "text": "13. IV. Sunday  Inexorable heat day and night. I attended public worship this morning at the second Presbyterian Church, and heard Mr Wood, from Romans 5.21. “That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so, might grace reign through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord,” Mr Wood said that the sum total of the Christian dispensation— The whole chapter is a parallel between the visitation of punishment upon the whole race of Adam, derivative from his sin of disobedience, and the restoration of the same family of man to eternal life, by the suffering and obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ.— This is the great doctrine of St. Paul—figurative and allegorical— Jesus, is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world—as the Dove is the Spirit of God alighting upon him and abiding with him— Just as Jesus was a lamb, just as the holy Ghost was a dove, just so was the sin of Adam a curse upon all his posterity, and just so was the crucifixion of Christ, the atonement for the primeval sin, and the restoration of the whole family of man to the Grace of God. And if so what remnant is there left of original sin, for any individual of this or any preceding age since the death of Christ to be responsible for— As in Adam all sinned so in Christ all were restored to life— Mr Wood had preached this Sermon once before, and said that he now repeated it, at the request of one of the members of the Congregation— He delivered it in a very heavy in inanimate manner, and he said it was impossible under such a heated atmosphere to discourse with the energy which might be necessary for the occasion— The evening service at St. John’s Church was postponed till 5. p.m. on account of the heat of the weather— Mr Hawley then read Prayers for the first Sunday after Trinity, with an additional prayer for rain, and preached from Luke 19.40. “And he answered and said unto them, I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.”— As Jesus was approaching Jerusalem, he was followed by multitudes of the People, shouting, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord. It was for this that the Pharisees called on him to rebuke his disciples; and this was his reply— He afterwards said that his kingdom was not of this world; but it was for suffering himself to be hailed as a king, and countenancing the pretension, that he was crucified— This Evening, General William H. Moseley of Northampton, Massachusetts, paid me a visit of curiosity. also Mr Samuel L. Southard President pro tempore of the Senate, and his brother Isaac Southard, who was a member of the U.S. house of Representatives in the 22d Congress from 1831 to 1833— Mary Cutts also spent the Evening here— There was a breeze throughout the day, but the deadly night calm came with the setting Sun and overcame me till I felt dropping into a lethargy— "

Monday  At 7 this morning Mr Franquinet came and began his portrait of me in crayons, he breakfasted with us and asked for another sitting to morrow morning to which I consented. He is a native Belgian, an experienced Connoisseur in the art of painting, and greatly admires the last portrait by Stewart of my father in his 90th. year— But his likeness of me is already a failure, and will in no respect equal that which he has taken, of judge Cranch— Mr Homer came in and introduced a gentleman whose name I did not retain and who came to see me only from curiosity— I had received a note from J. F. Webb the broker, which induced me to call at his Office and at that of the Franklin insurance company’s Office; but there was no person at either of them. At the House immediately after the reading of the Journal Mr Wise resumed his speech in support of Fornance’s motion to reconsider the vote adopting the old rules except the 21st. and spoke for upwards of six hours a continued invective upon me— He was apparently recovered from his fainting fit of last Friday, and he had sufficient self controul to avoid the bawling, brawling tone with which he then broke himself down—but beginning every successive sentence with a loud and vehement clatter; he immediately bowed down over his desk till his head and chest became horizontal, his mouth pouring out all the time his words in a whisper. Abolition—abolition—abolition—was the unvarying cry, and he represented me as a fiend, the inspirer and leader of all abolition— He gave a history in his own way full of misrepresentations of all the gag motions, orders and resolutions down to the Rule of 28. January 1840—from Pinckney’s gag in 1835— He finished about half past six when half a dozen members started up and Botts moved the previous question— Rayner of North Carolina intreated him to withdraw the motion, and promised that he would renew it—but Botts persisted—there was a call of the house, but only 210 members answered to their names— The previous question was then put and carried and then the reconsideration was carried by a vote of 106 to 104 and the house was again left without rules— Several motions were then made with great confusion and disorder till a motion was made to adjourn and carried by yeas, and nays. I came home about 8 O’Clock in great tribulation, and perplexed in the dilemma between firm perseverance, intemperate retaliation and tame submission. What I most need and fervently pray for, is controul over my own temper. Mr Samuel Whitcomb, brought me this morning an imploring Letter from Mr Jotham Lincoln of Hingham, begging for some office under the Treasury Department to give him and his family bread— He was turned out of an inspectors Office by David Henshaw in May 1829.— And having engaged in mercantile business since has been recently ruined by the failure of his partner— Mr Whitcomb asked me to introduce him to the Secretary of the Treasury—tomorrow— "

He breakfasted with us— He is a native of Maestricht, and saturated with the love of painting from his childhood— Morning visit from Mr Giddings of Ohio, with a Mr Cobden an Englishman traveling in the United States to obtain information concerning the agriculture of our grain growing region, for its bearing upon the corn Laws of England— Mr Whitcomb called and I went with him and introduced him to the Secretary of the Treasury, to plead in behalf of Mr Jotham Lincoln of Hingham, for an Office. On my way to the Capitol I stop’d at Mr Edouart’s lodgings and viewed his collection of Silhouettes or full length miniature shades. He has a curious collection of the figures of many distinguished men of this country assembled together and stand in one hall in relative positions to each other forming a very pleasant tableau, and many of them striking likenesses.— At the Franklin Insurance Company’s insurance Office I found Mr Grammer, who told me that he had lately purchased 200 dollars of the Stock of the Company at par—and that the 500 dollars advertised by Mr Webb belonged to Mr Evans of Baltimore who has lately failed— And that par, has been offered for it— At the house; when the vote last evening of 106 to 104 reconsidered the adoption of the old rules except the 21st. Kenneth Rayner of North-Carolina had offered an amendment to strike out the whole of the Resolution after the word resolved—and insert a resolution adopting the old rules, till otherwise ordered by the house, and for appointing a committee of 9 members to revise the rules, and confirming the choice of Officers and appointment of Committees hitherto made—this amendment was then objected to as out of order and the house adjourned— This morning after about an hour of wrangling upon points of order, and a refusal of a motion for the previous question Rayner got the floor and in a splendid Speech of three hours rang over all the changes of invective upon me and of Slave-breeding rhodomontade about abolition and the rights and institutions of the South: but on closing his speech he forgot to offer his amendment— Morgan of New York started up and after disclaiming a declaration which he said I had made, moved the previous question— I called on him to specify the declaration. His answer showed he did not understand what I had said— Rayner finally got his amendment before the house which was slashed up into fragments and finally rejected—so was another amendment which he next proposed, and lastly the question was again taken upon the adoption of the old rules with my amendment except the 21st. and lost by a vote of 107 to 104 several of the members on both sides changing their votes to make up a majority.— The house then about 8 p.m. adjourned.

Wednesday  Morning visits from Mr and Mrs Triplett of Kentucky and of Mrs Bell and Miss Yeatman— John Hayden, an old Sailor with a wooden leg, came yesterday to the house and sent in word to me that he wanted to see me. I went to the door and he said he was in distress, and wished for an opportunity to converse with me when I should be at leisure— I appointed this morning 9 O’Clock to see him at my house. Mr Franquinet had breakfasted with us, and taken the third and final sitting for my portrait— He says every body who has seen it, pronounces it an admirable likeness, but the harshness of the features is softened almost into smooth insignificance and the character of my countenance is lost— Hayden came at 9. and told me his tale— He was born at Bristol in England— Is 56 years old. at the age of 14 he was taken by a Master of an American Vessel and brought to this Country where he was bound as an apprentice to learn the art of Navigation— From that time he went to sea as an American Seaman till the war of 1812—with a protection under the name of John Geyer to escape from British impressment— At the breaking out of the War of 1812 he was on a Voyage to India. He was taken, carried to the Cape of Good hope. kept there two years and a half as a prisoner of War—then transfered to Dartmoor prison in England where in the butchery of American prisoners in April 1815 he was shot with a musket ball, and lost his leg by amputation.— He has a pension of 6 dollars a month: and has been ten or twelve years keeper of the light-house at tarpaulin cove. and there is a petition to the Secretary of the Treasury to turn him out, because he attended and voted at a Van Buren convention last year. He has a petition from whigs in the district numerously signed praying that he may retained, and a certificate from Mr Pleasonton that his light-house has him invariably well and faithfully kept— Hayden asked me to obtain access for him; I went with him, introduced him to Mr Ewing, told his story for him and presented his papers—intreating his decision this day; which he promised to give— I had also a long visit from Russel Freeman— At the house Stuart of Virginia offered a Resolution of compromise, to hang up all petitions for this Session and put off the debate on the rule to the winter Session, and moved the previous question. Nearly the whole day was consumed in debate on the previous question, which was at last carried 113 to 101. And Stuart’s motion was carried 119 to 103. Stanley immediately moved and carried a vote against reconsideration to prevent a motion for it from being made to-morrow, and the house adjourned about 6. O’Clock The Marine corps band of music. performed several airs and marches on the grounds fronting the Eastern flight of stairs of the Capitol. There was a crowd of company to hear them— I walked round the grounds, and listened to the music till 8. p.m, and then came home to dinner. "

Thursday—  My old Sailor light-house keeper John Hayden, came this morning before seven O’Clock, and intreated me to see the Secretary of the Treasury at 9. when he would come to his Office, and plead for him if the Secretary should appear to hesitate in coming to a decision in his favour— He said he had not slept a wink last Night— That he had seen and talked last evening with Mr Barker Burnell, the representative of the District within which the light house is situated and feared he was prejudiced against him on political grounds. He knew nothing about politics and never meddled with them: though he had once under persuasion attended and voted at a Convention: and this was the pretence upon which they wanted to turn him, and put in another man who did not need it half so much as he did, and who besides that was a demicrat! yes, Sir, a demicrat!— The poor fellow spoke of his mutilated and disabled body—of his wife and eight children of his wife’s mother 90. years of age, dependent on him for bread, till the tears gushed from his eyes. I told him I would go to the Secretary of the Treasury and plead for him, but before 9. he came again, in great agitation, and with tears in his eyes, but he said they were now tears of joy— He said I need not go to the Secretary, for he had confirmed him in his place; and he had now only to thank me for the aid I had given him, and to depart for home, which he should do to-morrow morning— Mr Palmer is a young Englishman, son of Mr Horsley Palmer of London, who brought and left with a card at my door a warm recommendatory Letter from Mr Charles A. Davis of New-York. On my way to the Capitol I stop’d at his lodgings to see Mr Palmer but he was not there— At the house which I found in Session, two Resolutions were adopted: one that after next Saturday, the hour of meeting of the house shall be ten O’Clock, in the morning and the other that during the next week and no longer the Speaker shall adjourn the house at 3. p.m. to give the Committees the afternoons to work, then sundry retrenchment and reform resolutions were debated and two of them were adopted. Watterston offered Resolutions of Call upon the President and heads of Departments for a list of removals with the reasons for them. He had a long preamble of whereases, quoting from the stump speeches of Webster, Clay, Bell and Crittenden last Summer declarations that no removals ought ever to be made without assignment of reasons for the removal— The whigs were all in commotion at this movement— Watterson’s motion to suspend the rules was rejected 57 to 130. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Taliaferro in the Chair on the Bill for the relief of Mrs. Harrison— I made some remarks to explain the motives for the Bill and moved to fill the blank with 25000 dollars— A stormy debate arose and continued till 5. O’Clock, when the Committee rose with out coming to any Resolution and the house adjourned. Call at the National Intelligencer Office and saw Mr Gales.

I had half an hour’s conversation with him upon the cases of N. P. Trist of M’Leod and of the Amistad— When Harrison came into office, he determined to remove Trist from the Office of Consult at the Havana.— Trist took himself off to Charleston S.C Mr Webster wrote him that he would be removed, but before receiving the Letter he embarked and returned to the Havana— Mr Tyler declined to remove him without a further investigation of the complaints against him, and the question is to be decided upon Cabinet consultation next week— Mr Webster is yet in negotiation with Mr Argaiz the Spanish Minister upon the Amistad case, and wishes to see my argument upon the trial before the Supreme Court— I called again at Mr Palmer’s lodgings, but he was out. At the house I put the question to the Speaker, whether the standing Committees appointed under Rules cancelled by the reconsideration of the resolution adopting them were still extant— I did not so consider them, or hold myself a member of any such committee— And to test the sense of the house I moved the usual order that the standing committees of the house be now appointed. The Speaker said that the motion was not in order; as he considered the appointment of the standing committees already made as in full force. I then asked to be excused from serving as chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, and was excused without opposition— Calhoun, from the rule revising committee reported a very good rule, which after some struggle was adopted— Then Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Taliaferro in the Chair on the bill for the relief of Mrs Harrison, which after a ferocious debate of 6 hours was reported to the house, with the blank filled with 25000 dollars moved by me, then after other obstructions broken down by previous questions, and refusals to adjourn, was passed to be engrossed and passed—122 to 66.

Mr Webster had sent for him yesterday and he had produced a tabular statement of the apportionment of representation from a standard of 50000 to one of 70000 souls for one representative at intervals of 500, of which Mr Webster had offered to have a copy made for me, but I declined. Mr Weems came this morning, and said they had made up at the Department an aggregate amount of each description of persons within the several Districts of the United States, by Counties and principal towns, and enquired if I would call this morning at the Department and ask to see it.

Trist’s despatches since his return as Consul at the Havana— He has contrived to pick a quarrel with the British Consul Turnbull, about Sailors— Mr Palmer paid me a visit this morning with his travelling companion Mr Wakefield—also Mr Homer with Mr Goodwin—Kavasales, whose perseverance of solicitation survives all prospect of success.— Russel Freeman too came, lingering here after numerous resolutions to go home— He shewed me at last a copy of a confidential Letter to him from H. A. S. Dearborn, dated 22. Septr. 1828. calling upon him for 100 dollars to be paid to D. Webster; to make up a sum of 5000 dollars to be expended in electioneering (printing pamphlets &c) in Kentucky. He had also a copy of all the proceedings in the Senate on the nomination of Lemuel Williams as Collector of New-Bedford, when Freeman was removed.— As to the proceedings of the Senate, I told him they would not be to him not worth a straw: but I advised him to see Webster, to shew him this confidential Letter; and tell him he is going home. He afterwards came to my seat in the house and shewed me the original Letter, and said he had sent 117 dollars— At the house J. C. Clark moved a reconsideration of the vote yesterday passing the bill for the relief of Mrs Harrison—to prevent the motion for reconsideration coming from the opposition side to make another debate. The reconsideration was rejected. Fornance made a speech upon a memorial for a protective tariff but he was mistrusted and his proposition was laid on the table— The States were called for petitions— Most of those presented were ruled out— I was arrested in the midst of the presentation of mine— Resolutions called. Mine for the aggregate of census returns was adopted— Barnard parceled out the President’s Message to the Committees, leaving out the African Slave-trade— I moved its reference to a select Committee of 9. members. too late— Barnard’s project for a bank Squeezed in— Adjourned at 3. p.m— Mrs M’Curdy here, with a piteous tale of distress— The Ladies went to hear the music at the Capitol.

I attended with my wife, Mary, and her daughter Mary-Louisa public worship this morning in the Hall of the House of Representatives where the services were performed by the Chaplain of the House, the Revd. Mr French of Georgetown— He read the prayers for the second Sunday after Trinity with out the Litany or the Communion service and preached from Matthew 22:37. [“]Jesus said unto him, thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 40. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets” The discourse was specially addressed to the members of Congress of whom there were about twenty present, and it contained an exposition of the preacher’s summary of duties incumbent on a Christian Legislator— He dealt of course in generalities, and revealed no new discovery. He began by saying that all the duties of man, might be divided into two Classes—duties of Religion, and duties of morality— This was a clear and natural partition: and perfectly conformable to his text— But when he said that the duties of a Christian Legislator were all comprized in the Love of God, and the love of his Country, he narrowed down the second division of the Saviour’s summary of human duties from the Christian to the Roman standard, from universal humanity to patriotism—what a falling off was there! Patriotism, is one modification of the Law of universal benevolence— Friendship is another—the family affections a third— The Christian’s duty embraces them all; and when they conflict with each other as they too often inevitably do, there is but one umpire between them and that is—Justice—inexorable justice— There is no impulse to action operating upon the heart of man, more potent to lead him astray from the path of Justice, than Patriotism— The Christian Legislator therefore must be not only a Patriot, but a Philanthropist—he must love not only his Country, but his neighbour and his neighbour is every individual of the human family, friend or foe. Mr French is in a low state of health— He appeared to preach without notes. His elocution is good—his manner emphatic and impressive—his action graceful and oratorical— He gave out a psalm to be sung, but there were no singers, and he gave notice that the chaplain of the Senate would preach next Sunday. I walked home, and on my way stopped at the National Intelligencer Office and saw Mr Gales he gave me a paper of 4. March last containing the list of Petitions not presented by me at the last Session of Congress— Miss Cutts dined with us— At 5. P.M. I attended at St. John’s Church where the Evening prayers for the second Sunday after Trinity were read by a Stranger, and Mr Chauncey preached from 1. John 3.13. “Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.” "

Barnard— Adjourned to Monday Morning at 9 O’Clock— No approximation of opinions— Elizabeth Pierce was here with a desponding Letter from Mr Underwood about the claims— Spoke of her sick Sister and her insane brother, and wanted to go to Baltimore; to which I encouraged her. Mr Elisha Whittlesey was here this evening with a Mr Kirkwood from Ohio— My wife went this evening and heard the Marine Corps band of Music at the Capitol. "

O’Clock this morning the select Committee on the currency met in the Committee room of the Committee of Commerce of the house— Present, the Chairman John Sergeant, Adams Pope, Botts, Habersham, M’Kay and Rhett— Mr Habersham proposed some slight amendments to the Bill for repealing the subtreasury Law, which after some modification were adopted. The Chairman had proposed on Saturday an additional section to repeal one Section of the act of June 1836, which it is understood will be revived by the repeal of the Sub-treasury.— Mr Botts this morning moved an amendment to repeal the whole act of 1836 except the 13th. and 14th. Sections; which after some discussion whether the Committee could reconsider, was adopted— The amendment of Mr Botts embracing that of Mr Sergeant and more.— A vote was taken that the Bill thus amended should be reported to the house; but a question arose, when— The house met at 10. Immediately after the reading of the Journal, W. C. Dawson, Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs announced the decease of Major-General Alexander Macomb, and offered three Resolutions. 1. of regret for the event 2. to attend the funeral 3. to appoint a joint Committee of arrangements— The Senate immediately concurred, and both houses adjourned— Henry Black had been sworn as a Representative from Pennsylvania in the place of Charles Ogle deceased, and Linn of New-York, had moved a reconsideration of a vote on Friday to continue through this week the meeting of the house at 10. A.M. and the adjournment at 3. p.m. Immediately after the adjournment the Committee on the Currency met again—present as before, with the addition of W. Cost Johnson— M’Keon the 9th. member of the Committee is absent— There was further discussion, altogether desultory— Botts, Pope and myself, are against reporting the repeal bill, till at least the Committee shall have considered of a substitute for the sub-treasury. Rhett and M’Kay are against reporting the repeal bill at-all— The Committee agreed to meet again to-morrow immediately after the adjournment of the house— The suddenness of the notice of the funeral prevented the attendance of any of the members at the house of the deceased— As many hacks as could be found disengaged were provided by the Committee of arrangements— I rode with Joshua Giddings, Seth M. Gates, and a friend of his from New-York State joining the procession, as after coming up the avenue it circled round the Capitol Hill—the procession civil and military was large— The coffin was deposited in the vault whence that of President Harrison was on Saturday last removed. I returned to the Capitol, and thence at 4. p.m. home— Evening visits from Mr. and Mrs Towle, George Folsom, and John Connell. "

                "text": "29. IV. Tuesday.  Mr Matthew St. Clair Clark, the clerk of the house had yesterday delivered to me two Letters from Alexander Hamilton of New-York, one of them enclosing a thick manuscript draught of an Act to establish an exchequer of issues (alias a Bank) to be the fiscal agent of the People of the United States—together with another manuscript equally thick of explanatory remarks upon the subject. Mr Hamilton had some months since written to me, on the general subject of the currency and finances—he now requested me to present his project and remarks to the house, and move that they be printed, which I did this morning, immediately after the reading of the journal— The house received the manuscripts and referred them to the Committee on the currency; but laid on the table the motion to print.— The States were called for petitions beginning with the territory of Ioway, this being the last of the 30 days upon which the call for petitions is daily.— I presented 5. one of which and a part of another were received— Mr Wise came to my seat, and said he had received a Letter from the State of Mississippi, from a person named Stanton containing charges against Samuel J. Gholson judge of the District Court in Mississippi, and that Stanton stated he had addressed a similar communication to me.— That he was delicately situated towards Gholson, having had a personal quarrel with him when he was a member of the house— And he thought therefore there would be more propriety in my presenting the charges, than that he should present them. I said I had received Mr Stanton’s Letter and petition, and had abstained from presenting the charges, for the same reason alledged by him— There had indeed been no personal quarrel between Gholson and me—but he and his Colleague Claiborne had signed and published in the globe a furious and most abusive attack upon me in the shape of an address to their Constituents. But another reason for postponing the presentation of the charges was that the State of Mississippi is not represented in the house and whether represented by Gholson’s friends or adversaries, they should be here when charges are presented against him— The M’Leod resolution was postponed— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Joseph Lawrence in the chair on the land Bill. W. Cost Johnson finished his speech, and Clifford of Maine, commenced a speech against the Bill. At 3. the Committee rose, and the house adjourned. Select Committee on the Currency— All present except W. Cost Johnson— Desultory discussion. Adjourned to Friday Morning at 9. Intelligencer Office—left with him A. Hamilton’s Manuscripts— Evening visits from Mr Nicholls who wants a Consulate from Garrett Davis, member from Kentucky, and from Watts Crane an old man from Newark, New-Jersey. "

Ross had written to request an interview with me for them, on my appointment as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs— I was excused from that service at my own request from a full conviction that its only result would be to keep a perpetual harrow upon my feelings, with a total impotence to render any useful service— The Policy from Washington to myself of all the Presidents of the United States had been Justice and kindness to the Indian tribes—to civilize and preserve them— With the Creeks and Cherokees it had been eminently successful.— Its success was their misfortune— The States within whose borders their settlements were took the alarm, broke down all the Treaties which had pledged the faith of the Nation.— Georgia extended her jurisdiction over them—took possession of their Lands, houses, cattle, furniture, negroes, and drove them out from their own dwellings— All the Southern States supported Georgia, in this utter prostration of faith and justice, and Andrew Jackson by the simultaneous operation of fraudulent treaties and brutal force consummated the work— The Florida War is one of the fruits of this policy; the conduct of which exhibits one interrupted scene, of the most profligate corruption— All resistance against this abomination is vain— It is among the heinous sins of this Nation for which I believe God will one day bring them to judgment—but at his own time, and by his own means. I turned my eyes away from this sickening mass of putrefaction, and asked to be excused from serving as the Chairman of the Committee— Ross and his colleagues are here, claiming indemnity for the household furniture, goods, and cattle stolen from their people, when they were expelled from their dwellings; and a new treaty to give them some shadow of security for the permanent possession of the lands to which they have been driven— They complain of delays, and neglect by the new Secretary of War, Mr Bell, and I promised to speak to him in their behalf—and I told them to call upon me freely, if upon any occasion I could be serviceable to them. At the house, immediately after the reading of the journal, Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Lawrence in the Chair on the land-bill. Clifford finished his speech, followed by Meriwether of Georgia, Howard of Michigan, Kennedy of Indiana, and Alford of Georgia till 3.

Between 5 and 6 I rode down to the banks of the river between the Tyber and the Bridge, and bathed and swam about 10 minutes— The tide had just turned, and a very light breeze just curled the surface of the water— On my return home I found William Jagger at my door— He comes now in search of evidence— This poor, ignorant, uneducated man some years since was smitten in his workshop with the fancy that he was an eminent politician and wrote and published sundry newspaper essays and pamphlets against Martin Van Buren. Brought thus into notice, he was violently attacked in turn, and his moral character was brought into question till he commenced an action for slander against the publisher of a newspaper in which he was assailed— The suit is now pending, and his adversary’s lawyer has turned the tables upon him by a special plea, which puts him to the proof of his charges against Van Buren— He now comes to me to ransack the public documents for proofs when I have no time to spare— At the house a communication was received from the Secretary of State relating to the census returns, but not the aggregate called for by my Resolution. There was a message from the President communicating a memorial signed by 3000 persons at New-York, praying for a bankrupt Law—and the Message cautiously recommends it— This process of petitioning Congress through the President is a novelty. Another message was also received enclosing copies of the President’s correspondence with Mrs Harrison in communicating to her the Resolutions of Congress honorary to her late husband— The M’Leod Resolution was again skipped over this morning to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Lawrence in the Chair on the Land Bill— But the democracy had now got wind of this whig stratagem, and recalcitrated— Cave Johnson sputtered against being gagged and called for the yeas and nays on the motion to go into Committee of the whole, but it was carried 106 to 69. I voted with the minority; disgusted with this perpetual establishment of rules perpetually to be suspended— On the land Bill Charles Brown a democrat of the first water from Philadelphia, worried the whigs with numerous charges of inconsistency, which they endeavoured in vain to suppress by continual calls to order— He was followed by Governor Thomas W. Gilmer of Virginia, a Hermaphrodite whig, and he by Benjamin A. Bidlack a slippery Pennsylvanian democrat, all against the bill— The floor was then taken by Francis W. Pickens of South-Carolina the Committee rose and the house adjourned. Miss Cutts was here this afternoon— The intense heat of the last two days was succeeded this Evening by a heavy and copious thunder shower, which refreshed the earth but very little the atmosphere— "

Friday  Bath and Swim in Potowmac—  Fifty minutes of the morning were consumed in riding to the river, ten minutes of bathing and swimming and returning home— Mr Uzielli an Italian Gentleman from Leghorn brought me a very courteous Letter of introduction from Alexis de Tocqueville who says that Mr Uzielli travels in America from Scientific and philanthropic curiosity.— At 9. A.M. I attended a meeting of the select Committee on the currency. Present J. Sergeant, Chairman, Adams, Pope, Habersham, Botts, M’Kay and Rhett— It was within a quarter of ten, when the quorum was formed. We had still no distinct question before the Committee. There are two projects for a National Bank under consideration— A Bill reported by the Secretary of the Treasury, and a Bill reported by Henry Clay, chairman of the Committee of the Senate to that body, and now in debate before them. Both Bills propose to locate the Bank in the District of Columbia— Both Bills propose the establishment of branches in the States, Ewing’s bill with the assent and Clay’s without the assent of the several States— To bring the deliberations of our Committee to a point I moved to take up the Bill now before the Senate, and to strike out from the first Section the words the District of Columbia, and insert the City of New-York— Sergeant observed that this would require a total change of the details of the Bill; which I admitted, but said that the whole question of bank or no bank was embraced in this small amendment— Details could easily be adjusted. There was no time to discuss the question, and the Committee agreed to meet at 5. to-morrow afternoon—but I expect to carry this motion for M’Kay and Rhett, who are against the Bill in any shape will vote for my amendment, and so I think will Pope and M’Keon—perhaps Botts— At the House— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Lawrence in the chair on the land-Bill— Pickens, for nearly two hours disgorged Calhoun crudities, with his usual bawling, brawling pomposity, against the Bill. Randolph of New-Jersey, Winthrop and James Cooper followed in support of the Bill, and Dean of Ohio, and then Habersham of Georgia against it— In the midst of his discourse, 3. O’Clock was approaching, the Committee rose— Underwood from the Committee on the District of Columbia introduced a bill to provide for the maintenance of pauper lunatics. Stanly moved to suspend the order for adjourning daily at 3 O’Clock— It would expire to-morrow, but they want to get the land bill out of Committee and through to-morrow— I objected that there was now no quorum and Stanley gave notice that he should renew his motion to-morrow morning.— I obtained permission from the Speaker to introduce Mr Uzielli upon the floor of the house behind the Bar— He came and spent half an hour in hearing Mr Winthrop’s maiden speech—a very good one— Mr Nicholls came this afternoon to urge his double suit for Mr Benjamin Romaine and for himself— Transient visit from Joseph Blunt.

Bath and Swim in the Potowmac  Total change in the temperature of the Atmosphere— Fair weather, a clear sky, warm Sun, balmy-breeze, and the Thermometer at 72— The repeated successive river baths, operate as friction upon the skin till it produces the excoriation of prickly heat— I called this morning at the Department of State, and saw Mr Webster. I enquired concerning the aggregate returns called for of the census by Resolution of the house. Mr William A. Weaver, the superintendent in charge of this bureau, stated that this document was not yet complete and would not be for some time.— A general tabular aggregate has been returned in answer to a call from the Senate—in which one Slave is returned in the State of Massachusetts— I enquired how that happened—upon examination of the returns it appeared to come from an assistant marshal in Nantucket named Worth, and the slave is reported as forming one of 16 persons in the family of Mrs Lydia Barker— Observing that this must be a mistake I requested that a Letter might be written to the assistant Marshal, requiring an explanation of this point in his return; which Mr Webster directed— I enquired about the supplementary parts of N. P. Trist’s correspondence, which have been all copied and are ready to be communicated— Derrick the Clerk who I have no doubt garbled the document communicated on the 3d. of March last, shewed some repugnance to furnishing these supplements, which he said were personalities— Mr Webster at first intimated a wish that I would look over the manuscripts to see if it would not be expedient to leave still some part of them out—but he finally concluded to send the whole— I named Mr Nicholls to him as an applicant for the appointment of Consul at Havre at Hamburg or elsewhere. I said to Mr Webster that the establishment of a National Bank was likely to fail; Upon which he said with some heat that he hoped if Congress should sit till next August twelve month, they would not adjourn with out establishing a national Bank— My detention at the Department belated me at the house, and they had been an hour and a half in session when I took my seat. Stanley did not make his motion to supersede the adjournment at 3 p.m— The house on meeting went immediately into Committee of the whole on the land-bill— Habersham had finished his Speech on the land-bill, and I found Parmenter prosing to the same tune— Richard D. Davis and John M’Keon spouted liquid fire of Democracy against it for about 2 hours, and John P Kennedy made a masterly Speech of about half an hour in its favour. Underwood of Kentucky rambled about it and about it another half hour and just before 3, Wise took the floor and the Committee rose— An attempt was made by Weller to adjourn over till Tuesday, defeated by W. B. Calhoun’s motion to adjourn— I walked home dined and returned to meet the Committee on the Currency. All present—debate on my motion to strike out the District of Columbia, and insert the City of New-York—adjourned to next Friday afternoon— Heard the Music of the Marine band; and rode home with my wife and Miss Cutts— Evening take-leave visit from Mr Uzielli.

I attended public worship at the Capitol expecting that the preacher, Mr Tustin, Chaplain to the Senate would have taken both in his prayer and Sermon some notice of the day.— He took no notice of it whatever— He gave out to be sung the 100th. Psalm, and his text was from Acts 17.31. “Because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained.” The day of Judgment! The subject of the last discourse, delivered from that same chair, not five months since by the ever lamented George G. Cookman, who has since perished in the Steamer President, no one knows how—upon the deep— Mr. Tustin alluded with some feeling both to the fact that Mr Cookman’s last discourse as his predecessor was on this awful theme, and to the deplorable event which so shortly afterwards sent the preacher so prematurely into the presence of his maker, but it was not well advised in Mr Tustin to select the same subject, with that of Mr Cookmans valedictory discourse, the profound impression of which dwells deep in the memory of his hearers. An unusually large number of the Senators were now present.— Walking home-ward with Jabez W. Huntington, Senator from Connecticut he assured me that Rives’s amendment to H. Clay’s Bank Bill would be rejected by a large majority, which I can yet scarcely credit— My wife attended Church at St John’s, and dined at Mr Frye’s— After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read the service for the fourth Sunday after Trinity and in reading the 45th. chapter of Genesis, the recognition between Joseph in his brethren was so deeply affected by it that he with great difficulty got through the reading and the tears gushed from his eyes. It was ludicrous— He preached from 2. Samuel 7.22. [“]Wherefore, thou art great, O Lord God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee”— He gave notice that Mr Wood would deliver a Lecture at the second Presbyterian Church, at 8 O’Clock this Evening upon the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory.— I attended that Lecture, which followed the usual exercises of prayer and Psalm singing— Mr Wood’s text was from Matthew 7–16. “Ye shall know them by their fruits.”—and his argument was upon the immoral tendency of the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory— It was the second of two Lectures on that subject— The first had examined it historically; and had shewn that of the antient fathers only two, Tertullian and Origen gave a countenance to it— He said the great proof of its immoral tendency was that it nullified the merits of the atonement, and transferred the power of absolving guilt from punishment from God to man— But this argument bears rather against the priest’s power of absolution than against the doctrine of purgatory itself.

                "text": "5. IV. Monday.  The celebration of the anniversary of Independence was more signalized on this day than it has been for several years and in a manner hitherto unusual: first by an assemblage of all the children of the Sunday schools, who went in procession with their teachers and with banners indicating to which Church each of the companies belonged to the enclosed square before the eastern front of the Capitol, where they sat down under the shade of trees in the Northernmost alley of the close where they were addressed by several Gentlemen, and particularly by Mr Samuel L. Southard President pro-tempore of the Senate. I had been invited by Mr Stansbury to address them and had declined— There was also a procession of the temperance Societies, very numerous but which I did not see.— I found Mr Wise on his feet, bawling against the bill for distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands— He spoke little short of three hours and a quarter, and concluded with going, going—gone— Half a dozen members were up for the floor as he sat down— The Chairman gave it to Kenneth Rayner of North Carolina, who moved the Committee to rise— This was carried by Tellers, and the motion to adjourn by yeas and naystoThe Senate had adjourned over from Saturday till to-morrow— The weather was intensely warm, and the sky bright with a blazing Sun— I came home and at 5. O’Clock went and dined with President Tyler, and a company chiefly of members of the House of Representatives.— I note them so far as my memory serves— William C. Rives of Virginia, and Reuel Williams of Maine, were the only members of the Senate present— Major General Winfield Scott with his aid de camp Captain Robert Anderson. Scott has just received the appointment of Major General in the place of the deceased General Macomb— The members of the house were George N. Briggs, Walter Coles, William A. James Graham, Richard W. Habersham, William Cost Johnson, Thomas Butler King, Joseph Lawrence, John T. Mason, Eugenius A. Nisbet, John Pope, Cuthbert Powell, George H Proffit, Joseph F. Randolph, Augustine H. Shepperd, Lewis Steenrod, Philip Triplett Henry Van Rensselaer, and William H. Washington were of the party— Noland the Commissioner of the public buildings, Lawrence of the Treasury Department commonly called beau Lawrence, were there—a Mr Chapin, a Mr M’Carty and five or six other strangers, with the President and his private Secretary John Tyler junr. There was turtle soup from a turtle weighing 300 lb a present from Key West. The President drank wine with every person at table in squads— He gave two toasts and called on me for one: I gave, the application to our political institutions, of that principle of the Law of Nature, by which All Nature’s difference keeps all nature’s peace— After dinner I called to see Mr Badger, but he was out on the square of the President’s house viewing the fire works as I did— Sundry visitors as in the margin above— "

                "text": "6. IV:30. Tuesday  An arduous day— Thunder gust  At half past 9 this morning I called at the Navy Department and presented to the Secretary Mr Badger a second of Exchange for 1500 dollars at 30 days sight drawn by R. R. Walden, purser in the exploring expedition, on the Secretary of the Navy, payable to the order of Charles Wilkes Esquire, commanding U.S. exploring expedition—dated U.S. ship Vincennes Oahu Decr. 2. 1840—endorsed Charles Wilkes, Henry Paty, Isaac B. Rich, and Schuyler Sampson, payable to my order— I had received it last Saturday from Mr Sampson for collection— It was accepted by Mr Badger, who enquired how it was to be paid— Mr Sampson had instructed me, by a draft on the receiver General at Boston— I had received a Letter from my nephew and namesake who a few weeks since passed his examination as a Midshipman, and who wishes immediate employment; and if possible in the Mediterranean squadron now on the point of sailing— Mr Badger said this would be impossible— And he said he wished the Officers of the Navy, who had any application to make to the Department, would make it themselves. I mentioned again to him the names of Kavasales, and as usual he spoke of him in the most favourable terms, but with obvious determination not to appoint him— His reason is that Kavasales, being a foreigner, a Greek of diminutive stature of meek and humble deportment, a foreigner, a Greek would be contemned by the Sailors, and therefore could not render useful service At the Pension Office, I spoke to Mr Edwards in behalf of Mr Benjamin Romaine’s pension claim—and left with him a Letter concerning the claim of John Borst jr a Soldier of the last War— I found the house in debate on a rule reported this morning by the Committee on the rules— A new screw, to take bills out of Committee of the whole house at the pleasure of the majority— This rule after a convulsive struggle of the opposition, was adopted, first with a limitation of 6 days moved by Briggs and then by reconsideration, without limitation— It was immediately applied to the land bill—a Resolution was driven through by previous question and yeas and nays: that at 7. O’Clock this evening the debate in Committee of the whole should cease and the question should be taken upon all the amendments proposed, and on the bill— The house then between 2 and 3 went into Committee of the whole on the Bill. Rayner made a speech of nearly three hours in favour of the bill. Then Thomas F. Marshall, short of one hour, a burst of eloquence, incomparable; for the bill: and R. B. Rhett was cut off in the midst of a nullification trumpeting by the hour of seven. Then began for four hours a succession of trivial amendments, merely to waste time, not one of which succeeded, except a fourth section moved by me and carried at length the bill was reported to the house—the amendments including mine adopted—passed to be engrossed and passed. Motion to reconsider the vote on the bill moved and rejected— The vote on the passage of the Bill was 116 to 108.— Adjourned at 20 minutes past 11. I took Mr Winthrop home to his lodgings. I reached home just before midnight. "

Call at the Bank of the Metropolis and received 80 half-eagles, by a check from the Speaker, and at Charles Nourse’s office, whence he sent me 206 dollars in Virginia Bank Notes, in exchange for 40 of them— At the house Jacob M. Howard, member from Michigan stated that he had been suddenly taken ill last evening just before the question upon the land bill had been taken, and had been obliged to leave the house. He asked leave to record his name in favour of the bill; but was refused. Fillmore, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means reported an appropriation Bill for fortifications, Ordnance, and suppression of Indian hostilities— Referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Atherton in the face of the land-bill passed last Night moved instructions to the Committee to provide that the proceeds of the sales of the public lands should be yearly applied to completing the fortifications.— The Speaker pronounced this motion out of order. Atherton appealed.— Stanley moved to lay the appeal on the table— Carried 108 to 77.— Wise, Chairman of the Committee of Naval Affairs reported a Bill for the purchase of Naval Ordnance and stores and other purposes; and T. B. King from the same Committee reported a Bill providing for a home squadron— Wise moved the printing of an extra number of copies of the bill and report—500 copies, two for each member— I moved 5000 copies which was carried— Pickens enquired when the committee on the currency would report on the Senate bill repealing the Sub-treasury— Sergeant answered, when they should be ready— Lot Warren obtained a suspension of the rules, to take up a Resolution of which he had given notice yesterday, that no member should be allowed to speak more than one hour at a time— Warren called the previous question and carried his resolution by yeas and nays 111 to 75— I voted against the Resolution, but hope it will effect much good.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Briggs in the Chair. A Bill making provision for the maintenance of lunatics in the District of Columbia was taken up and discussed about two hours—then the bill from the Committee of Ways and Means, authorising a loan of twelve Millions of dollars at 5. per cent interest— Mr Fillmore Chairman of the Committee, presented in the compass of the hour, an exposition of the expediency of the Bill, and the purposes of its several provisions—he was followed by Samuel Gordon a New-York democrat of vinegar aspect, who railed his hour out against the loan and the bank bill, and the land-bill, and the tariff and the permanent debt, and the State-debts, and the Hamiltonian funding system and all the rigmarole of mock democracy. He was called to order a dozen times and finally choked off by the expiration of the hour. At 3. the Committee rose and the house adjourned. I went into the Senate chamber and spoke to Mr H. Clay, in behalf of my 4th. Section of the land-bill. He thinks the passage of the Bank Bill in the Senate doubtful. "

Thursday  Mr Ratcliff of New-York was here this morning, still ruminating upon the project of opening a ship-canal across the isthmus of Panama— He enquired whether I thought it expedient for him to visit President Tyler, and ascertain his views upon the subject, which I advised him to do— I said I had observed in some notice of the recently published work of Messrs. Stevens and Catherwood upon central America, that they had brought new information into public view on this subject— He said very little— There were two different plans for accomplish this work; of which Mr Stevens had examined only the most difficult, and by the longest route— I found the house in Session, passing a bill to extend the limits of the Port of New-Orleans— Fillmore moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the Loan Bill— John C. Clark wanted to offer a Resolution that the house should take a daily recess from 2 to 4 O’Clock and Hiram P. Hunt wanted to make his speech upon the M’Leod Resolution— Both of them intreated Fillmore to allow the morning hour for resolutions before he insisted upon going into Committee of the whole, but he was inexorable— So the question was taken by yeas and nays and the house refused to go into Committee 76 to 89.— Clark offered his resolution for a daily recess, but Cave Johnson objected, and Clark did not venture to move a suspension of the rules. The Speaker called over the Committees for reports but none were made— Proffit offered a Resolution requiring forthwith a report from the Committee on the Currency, upon the Senate Bill to repeal the subtreasury—without waiting to couple it with any banking project.— Proffit complained that there was not a single North-western man, on the Committee upon the currency— But his resolution was not received. Hunt then spoke till the expiration of the morning-hour against Floyd’s M’Leod Resolution— Then the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Briggs in the Chair upon the loan-Bill— Pickens poured out with more than usual volubility a flood of Calhounisms against the Bill, till the Chairman to his utter amazement told him his hour was out— Bless my Soul said he, turning to look at the Clock, I have but just begun— He was in great indignation and wanted an allowance for interruptions; but Briggs was inflexible and he was compelled to sit down with an imprecation upon the “infamous rule”— He was answered by John Sergeant, who shivered his speech to atoms, but was in like manner arrested by the expiration of his hour— Robert Barnwell Rhett replied to Sergeant in a tone, much subdued from that of his usual swaggering.— Fessenden of Maine followed him in a speech of half an hour— He is a fluent but not an impressive Speaker— Saltonstall then took the floor, but it was 3. O’Clock—the Committee rose and the house adjourned. Mr Leavitt came to my seat and took leave of me, returning to New-York— I walked home— My wife was ill, and kept her bed till the Evening. "

Dr Todsen was here this morning and said he was an applicant for the appointment of Consul at Hamburg or Bremen and he came as usual to solicit my influence—a quantity less than nothing— I had received last evening a note from Mr Fletcher Webster, chief clerk in the Department of State, with the copies of the parts of N. P. Trist’s despatches, not communicated with the President’s Message of the 3d. of March last, and now prepared to be reported in answer to the call from the house of the present Session— I read them through last evening and this morning; and took them back to the Department.— Two or three of the first Letters are altogether immaterial; but all the rest are important especially the omissions from the letter of 22. May 1838. and the explicit and unqualified averment of the head money, received by the Captain General of the island of Cuba for every negro imported illegally from Africa.— I desired that the whole of the manuscripts should be communicated to the house in answer to the call. A young man named Ringgold, one of the Clerks who made the copies, seemed shocked at the idea, that the direct charge that the Governor receives hush money for so gross a violation of the Law, should be communicated to Congress— I said it was the paper precisely of all others the most wanted— At the house I found Aaron V. Brown of Tennessee sweating and railing at the Secretary of State Webster, in discussion upon John G. Floyd’s Resolution concerning the M’Leod case.— Hunt had occupied the first ten minutes in concluding his speech on the other side; and Brown was cut off by the expiration of the morning hour, with a remnant of 15 minutes for him to-morrow— Fillmore then offered a Resolution to take the loan Bill out of Committee of the whole to-morrow, which he afterwards modified to Monday at 2. O’Clock which was carried by yeas and nays 97 to 79— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Briggs in the Chair on the Loan Bill. Saltonstall one hour in support of the Bill— Wise a flash in the pan against it— Watterson half an hour to prove that the whigs contracted the debt— Cushing replied to Watterson and others followed by Eastman of Maine, and M’Keon of New-York against the Bill. The debate was closed for the day by D. D. Barnard who consumed his hour in support of the Bill— M’Kay of North-Carolina took the floor against it—but it was 4. O’Clock the Committee rose; the house adjourned, and I walked home— John F. Heath, a young man from Petersburg Virginia, brought me a letter recommendatory from Francis C. Rives, a member of the last Congress but not of this— The same young man visited me two years ago at Quincy, being then at the Law School in Cambridge. He is now going to Europe, and wants a Passport and Letters. I promised to go with him to-morrow morning to the Department of State— I shewed William Jagger the Journal H.RUS. 24. Feby 1836— And Report of Committee which he wants— "

The Secretary was not there, but we saw his Son and chief clerk; and Mr Heath obtained his passport. I rode with him to the Capitol. Aaron V. Brown was closing his flabby Philippic against the Secretary of State, upon the M’Leod Resolution— He was followed by Archibald L. Linn of New-York, on the other side, till the expiration of the morning hour. Then came the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Briggs in the chair. M’Kay fretted his hour against the loan bill, and as M’Leod’s case is the catapult against the Secretary of State, so the loan bill is the 42 pounder against the Secretary of the Treasury Ewing. M’Kay fancies himself a great financier—affects great moderation, and covers an insidious and invidious spirit under a mask of candour— His constituents cling to him— This is his sixth Congress. He is a plain mean-looking man, with a blacksmith air, and as careless of dress as myself.— Mild, gentle, wary in discourse and conduct, and priding himself upon occasionally voting against his party.— His chief battery against Ewing to day, was an error in a document reported by him recently to the Senate, by the omission of an item of expenditure amounting to more than half a million— The error was detected in the Senate by the late Secretary Woodbury, and admitted in a subsequent report from Mr Ewing, to the Senate— One acknowledged errors furnishes hostile argument, with inference of other errors, indefinite in magnitude and number— M’Kay was followed by Thomas W. Gilmer late Governor of Virginia, a political whiffler, half whig, half nullifier— I left him speaking against the Bill, and called on Mr Heath, at Gadsby’s to inform him that Baron Roenne the Prussian Minister was in the City at Mrs Ulrich’s, of which I had received notice on a card of the Chevalier Hulsemann— I went with Heath to Mrs Ulrich’s, but the Baron was not at home. Heath had seen him once, and he had told him that he had two sons at Heidelberg whither Heath is going. He wanted to ask him for Letters to them— Heath is going on immediately to Boston there to embark for England, and took the Cars for Baltimore, at half past 5. this afternoon— My wife concluded to go at the same time— I went with her to the cars, and there introduced Mr Heath to her.— He promised to attend to the transfer of her baggage at the proper time and places— I saw the Cars depart and returned home— Spent the Evening with R. C. Winthrop, and L. Saltonstall at their lodgings at Mrs Galvin’s—C. Street— There were about 50 members of both houses of Congress and a few others invited to meet the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, Lemuel Shaw, here on a visit— Captain Percival and T. W. Ward were of the party. H. Clay was there, but went away—sick Two of my colleagues, Charles Hudson and Barker Burnell walked home with me, between 10 and 11. "

How peculiarly impressive ought it then to be, when the annual warning of the shortening thread, sounds in tones deepened by the Church bells of the Lord’s day? The question comes with yearly aggravation upon my conscience—what have I done with the seventy-four years that I have been indulged with the blessing of life? and following close upon it, another what can I do, what shall I do with the scanty and perilous remnant of life before me? The decay of body and mind, is gradually but with quickening pace gaining upon me— The time has come when I cannot with rational probability flatter myself even with one other return of the day. May I supplicate the father of Spirits, for the will and the power, to improve my last days in conformity to his will, for the good of my own family and the family of man, and in preparing to appear before his presence to plead for mercy?— And for his protecting arm to shield and sustain the helpless whom I leave behind?  I attended the morning service at the second presbyterian church; where a stranger named Lipscomb preached from Revelation 1.4. [“]John to the seven churches, which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come: and from the seven Spirits, which are before his throne; 5. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood. 6. And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father: to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen,”— A harsh, grating, bursting unmanaged, voice, a drawling intonation, and vulgar pronunciation, cast some disfavour upon a discourse interesting by its originality and ingenuity, and by the fervour of the zeal with which it was delivered— The analysis of the text marked a thinking mind— The remarks upon the form and substance of the salutation—upon the manner of expressing the eternity of God—upon the seven Spirits, and upon the attributes ascribed to Jesus Christ, were all fruits of genuine meditation, and not scraps from a commonplace book—but all marred, by an ungracious delivery— Morning visit from Mr Joseph Howe of Halifax, Nova-Scotia, from whom I received so many kind attentions and so much hospitality last September— He is now Speaker of house of Assembly of that Province. He has been traveling into Canada, and thence down through the State of New-York. He proposes to stay here only two or three days.— After dinner at St. John’s. Mr Hawley read the Evening prayer’s for the 5th. Sunday after Trinity and Bishop Ives of North-Carolina preached from Matthew 6.16—“Verily I say unto you, they have their reward”— A handsome person, lawn sleeves, and good articulation— Captain Buchanan and Miss Cutts were here at tea.

I called at 9 this morning at Brown’s hotel on Mr Joseph Brown and took him with me to the Capitol— Visited first the Congress Library and introduced him to the librarian Meehan; and to Mr Preston the Senator from South Carolina— Then to the Speaker’s chamber, and to C. Cushing in the house. Then to the Senate chamber, where I introduced him to the Senators Wright, Buchanan and Walker. we then returned to the house at the meeting of which the Revd. Mr French made the prayer. I offered a Resolution, requiring of the Secretary of the Treasury a report at the commencement of the next Session: which was received, but Cave Johnson objected to its immediate passage, and it lay over for the day— The house then went immediately into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the loan Bill; Briggs in the Chair— John W. Jones occupied his hour against the Bill. Garrett Davis followed and while he was speaking I went into the Senate chamber, with Mr Howe, and found them in hot debate upon the bank bill— I introduced Mr Howe to Mr Clay of Kentucky, who was however in conflict of eloquence with Mr Buchanan— I left Mr Howe, and returned to the house where Charles G. Atherton, a cross-grained numskull from New-Hampshire was snarling against the loan bill; when he closed there was little more than half an hour left till 2 when the questions were to be taken— Fillmore had this time by the consent of Proffit, who had obtained the floor, but yielded it.— Fillmores reply was chiefly to John W. Jones— At 2 the debate ceased— Fillmore moved to strike out the first section and insert a substitute— Gilmer moved an amendment for a new issue of Treasury Notes instead of a loan—lost 82 to 119— M’Kay moved an amendment, to strike out part of Fillmore’s new Section, and insert other matter— Chairman decided that this was not in order, the rule of the house that a motion to strike out and insert is not divisible— But the Committee reversed Briggs’s decision, and then rejected M’Kays amendment 91 to 108. sundry other captious amendments were moved and rejected—but Fillmore’s substitute for the first Section was adopted— The bill was then reported— Morgan immediately moved the previous question, which was carried. Clifford called the yeas and nays on the main question 126 to 88—amendments adopted. Yeas and Nays on the engrossment 127 to 91. Yeas and Nays on the 3d. reading 124 to 93. Wise then moved to go into Committee of the whole on two Bills reported by the Committee on Naval Affairs; but it was past 3. O’Clock and the house adjourned. I called at Gadsby’s hotel, and left a Card for Chief Justice Shaw; who was gone to Mount Vernon— He returned my visit this evening with Mr T. W. Ward and Captain Percival. Before them I had also an evening visit from Mr Charles J. Ingersoll, who came to spy out the nakedness of the land, and who told me that Commodore Stewarts nomination as a candidate for the Presidency was a movement against Buchanan. "

                "text": "13. IV. Tuesday—  I found the house in Session, Wise had enquired whether the Resolution offered by me yesterday of enquiry respecting the State debts had been received— The Speaker had answered him that it was. When I came in, I asked the consent of the house to take it up; but Cave Johnson insisted that he had a Resolution of prior date, of the precedence before mine he would not relinquish the claim— So the M’Leod Resolution was taken up, and the morning hour was wasted by Samuel S. Bowne of Otsego, New-York, a Bombastes furioso all froth and venom against the Secretary of State. He said he was of a Quaker family, but was full of fight and was for taking John Bull by the horns at once. When he closed, John Young of Genesee took the floor; but the hour was out— Wise moved to go into committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon two of the three bills reported from the Committee of Naval Affairs— But he yielded to Underwood, to take up the bill making further provision for pauper lunatics in the District of Columbia which with little grumbling opposition and by the previous question screws was passed for engrossment and passed— The house then went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and the Speaker called me to the Chair— The first bill was a mere appropriation of 139666 dollars and 6 cents to pay the navy pensions, on the first of this month, and the first of next January.— I had prepared, and intended to move a second Section, restoring the fund of more than eleven hundred thousand dollars which it owned on the 3d. of March 1837— But Wise came to my seat and urged me to forbear encumbering the Bill; saying that the Committee were all for restoring the fund, but intended to revise the whole system at the Winter Session. I accordingly suppressed my second Session but M’Kay and Cave Johnson, started a debate of nearly four hours upon motions to amend, all having in view to repeal the act of 3. March 1837—and they carried their point in Committee of the whole. The second Bill contained an appropriation of 600000 dollars for the purchase of Ordnance and making experiments in Gunnery— M’Kay cavilled at this too and moved to reduce the appropriation to 300000 dollars but fail—one bill was reported with two amendments—the other without amendment— I opposed the amendments in the house and one of them failed—the bill then passed for engrossment and passed— The house adjourned about 4. I walked home in the blaze of a dog-day Sun. I was much over-heated— Company to dine as in the margin, except Walter Hellen who was here this Evening. Heat of the weather intense. "

The heat of the night was so oppressive that I was sleepless—and twice up at 1. and 3. a.m. to come to the window to breathe. The first Night this season that this has happened— And I had in addition, last night a constant spasmodic affection, threatening cramps, and prickly heat over my whole body. At the house, several petitions, and memorials were received before I reached the Hall.— Floyd’s M’Leod Resolution was then taken up, John Young of Genesee a whig member from New-York made a speech of a short hour, rather inflammatory, censuring both the late and the present administrations, for not obtaining satisfaction from Great Britain for the burning of the Steam-boat Caroline— The view that he took of the case was altogether one-sided, as between the United States and Great-Britain— He spoke with some fluency and with appearance of candour, but carefully avoiding all the weak points of our cause in that controversy— The decision of the Supreme Court of the State of New-York refusing to discharge M’Leod upon Habeas-Corpus, and remanding him to Niagara County for trial, was this day received— When Young closed Morgan took the floor; but as a few minutes only of the morning hour remained, the subject was laid over, and Fillmore reported a Bill in relation to duties and drawbacks; twice read and referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Pickens immediately claimed of Fillmore exemption from all the rules restrictive of debate which of course Fillmore could not grant— Wise called up the Navy Ordnance Bill and moved the previous question upon it— Snyder of Pennsylvania asked for the yeas and nays upon its passage, and it passed— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Gilmer in the chair on the home Squadron Bill— Wise opened the case, but T. B. King who reported the bill was not ready, and at his instance the Committee rose, Wise stubbornly struggling against it; the fortification Bill was taken up, and raised a debate of three hours, first upon a complaint of Clifford that nothing was proposed for Maine—then upon a contingent appropriation for the pea-patch, the title to which an individual has recovered at Law against the United States— This item of appropriation was struck out— Clifford moved an amendment of 6000 dollars for forts in Maine and after some discussion the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— Robert Reeve came to complain that he had yesterday been dismissed from his office in the Treasury Department.

Thursday  The lightning rod above the Capitol, was struck by one of the thunderbolts last evening, and the Union tavern at Georgetown was struck with another— The two explosions occurred within the space of four or five minutes while the clouds were passing directly over our heads— The heat of the atmosphere was not sensibly abated by the storm of last evening, which was succeeded by a flat and sultry calm, freshened however by the copious fall of rain. A quiet sleep of five hours, restored part of my strength and from 5 to 6 this morning, I took my bath in the Potowmac— At the house, Morgan of Cayuga, New-York, had the floor on Floyd’s M’Leod Resolution; but Fillmore, Chairman of the Committee of the ways and means, asked him to give way, to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the fortification Bill— Morgan readily consented; but Cave Johnson now the nuisance of the house, made a fruitless struggle for the morning hour; and complained piteously of the gag upon the minority.— He was not heeded, and deserved not to be. I do not approve and have voted against the restrictions upon the freedom of debate, but when a tyrannical majority fall into a minority they cannot chuse but to abuse the privilege of which they have deprived others— The house went into Committee of the whole, Robert C. Winthrop in the chair, as he had been yesterday; and took up the fortification Bill.— An appropriation was again moved for the pea-patch, and the debate became desultory. The absurdity of appropriating money to be wasted on a spot where by verdict of a jury and judicial sentence the public has no title, and where the owner claims a most extortionate price for a worthless mud bank forms no sufficient obstacle to this motion, and half the day was consumed in discussing it— When that was past Underwood of Kentucky started an enquiry, why so much money should be appropriated for repairs upon Fort Warren and Fort Independence in Boston harbour. He ransacked all the fortification Bills from 1836 down to the present time, to prove that the appropriations now proposed could not be necessary. He said the same remarks would apply to all the others but he named those of which he complained only in Boston Harbour. Parmenter and Saltonstall answered him, and Horace Everett took the floor. But it was 3 O’Clock, the Committee rose, and the house adjourned. Evening visit from Dr Palfrey with his brother, settled at New-Orleans and another Gentleman from that City— Also from Mr Whittlesey and his nephew of the same name. "

There are five islands in the group with a population of about 40000— A year or two ago the french frigate L’Artemise Captain La Place, laid these islands under a contribution of 20000 dollars, and compelled them to admit a Roman Catholic establishment of Jesuits in competition with the American Missionaries— The American Board of Missions have made application to the Government of the United States to interpose for the protection of the American Missions by remonstrance to the French Government, and Mr Bingham is now here for that object— At the House, the morning hour was consumed in debating a foolish set of retrenchment Resolutions offered by Garrett Davis, with an amendment offered by Cave Johnson, and an amendment to the amendment offered by Botts— Stanley moved to lay the whole subject on the table; but that was rejected by yeas and nays 65 to 114. when the question upon the Resolution was put, I asked that it might be read, as I was not in my seat when it was offered— Turney of Tennessee objected to its being read—the Speaker decided that I had a right to call for the reading— Turney appealed from his decision, and the house confirmed it, almost without a dissenting voice— Turney pretended that the reading of some paper recently called for by him had been refused. M’Kay demanded a division of Botts’s amendment. The first part was adopted with only four opposing votes and the other part was rejected 34 to 145.— Cave Johnson’s Amendment and Garrett Davis’s Resolution—were all adopted. 128 to 78. all to no earthly purpose.

The coolness of the weather diminished the pleasure of the bath, and the effect of my repeated baths with the excessive and almost incessant heat of the last fortnight has been to throw the internal heat of my body out upon the skin, in a rash, amounting almost to excoriation. At the meeting of the Currency committee last evening all the members except Mr R. B. Rhett were present; but two of them were engaged for parties and no sooner was the quorum formed than there was a motion to adjourn— This was not immediately carried—but the sitting was not of more than one hour, and half that was absorbed in discussion, when and how we should meet in future— We took up the bill now pending in the Senate, and which has there been laid upon the table from inability to carry it through; our Chairman read six Sections of it, and sundry amendments were proposed discussed and adopted. Before 7. O’Clock we adjourned to 9 this morning— I was there to the minute— I found Sergeant there, but it was more than half past 9 before a Quorum was formed, and then we had to settle when we should meet again—at 5 this afternoon or at 9 Monday Morning— At last Sergeant proposed to ask leave of the house after this day to sit during the sitting of the house and this was carried against the remonstrances of Mr Rhett and of me— In the house, Arnold of Tennessee moved a reconsideration of the resolution adopted yesterday to take the fortification bill out of Committee of the whole this day at two O’Clock. Arnold gave as his reason that he has last Evening had an interview with a person of the first distinction in this Government, and had ascertained that all the great measures of relief to the People for which this special Session was called will fail—all founder in the gulph of Virginia abstractions— He dilated upon this oracular giving out, under great apparent excitement and alarm. The instant he finished John T. Mason of Virginia offered a joint resolution to adjourn the two houses next Thursday the 22d. instt. The gloating joy and Sardonic grin of the opposition gang was sickening— Mason’s resolution was not in order nor received, but the vote to take the bill out of Committee at 2 O’Clock this day was reconsidered by yeas and nays— The Committees were called for Reports. leave was given to the Committee on the currency to sit during the sitting of the house— An answer was received from the Secretary of War to the Call moved yesterday by Wise. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Winthrop in the Chair— Fortification-bill— Underwood twattled his hour out against the appropriations, all the time declaring that he should vote for the bill— Cushing answered him Steenrod Bombasted in your Herkles vein an hour, and appealed to the President, as a Virginian— Botts offered a Resolution to take the bill out of Committee next Tuesday at 2. Carried— Adjourned at 1/2 past 3. I walked home— Mary Louisa came home from General Jesup’s near Kalorama where she has been passing several days. I went to the Capitol with Mary and Jane Jesup, Mary Louisa, and Theodore Talbot. Walked in the grounds and heard the music— Evening visit from Revd. Mr Bingham. "

I attended this morning with Mrs John Adams and Mary Cutts at the Capitol, and heard Mr Bingham, the Missionary to the Sandwich Islands, who preached in the Hall of the house of Representatives, from Nehemiah 2:20. “Then I answered them and said, unto them— The God of heaven, he will prosper us: therefore we his servants will arise and build.” Of the history connected with the text, the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and of the Temple, on the return of fragments of the tribe of Judah from the Babylonian captivity, he said little—there are analogies between the circumstances under which that undertaking was accomplished, and those which have attended the mission to the Sandwich Islands, sufficiently marked to justify the application of the text to the religious enterprize which in the compass of the last quarter of a century has been with so much encouraging prospect of success in converting, the canibal Savages of the Southern Ocean, into a civilized, intelligent, pious Christian community— The Mission to the Sandwich Islands was first instituted in 1819. and Mr Bingham was the first missionary.— There are now 19 churches and 20000 worshippers on the five islands.—Schools in proportion— Trade, commerce, agriculture, arts, manufactures, Christian apparel have followed as a consequences— Christian wedlock is taking the place of promiscuous intercourse— Family affections have superseded infanticide— A limited monarchy, brutal despotism. Mr Bingham presented a multitude of details.— He read two or three verses from the Book of Psalms in the Sandwich Islands Bible, which he proposed to present to Congress, and he sung very sweetly in that language a version of one Stanza, of Bishop Heber’s beautiful hymn— Mr Bingham is not eloquent but his exhortations to spread over the whole surface of the globe the missionary cause were fervent and sincere— Captain Buchanan dined with us.— I received a Letter dated last Tuesday the 13th. from my dear and suffering wife at Quincy, where she arrived safely as she had proposed— Mary received another, dated Wednesday the 14th.— After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read prayers for the 6th. Sunday after Trinity and preached from Romans 14.13. “Let us not therefore judge one another, any more: but judge this rather; that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother’s way.” what an admirable text! how appropriate. How seasonable! how fruitless! After church I visited Mr Bell—Mr Ewing was there—and Mr Lewis Williams and Coll. Totten— Long and painful conversation with Mr Bell— Then to the Presbyterian church: Mr Wood from Luke 18.13.14 delivered a Lecture against the Roman Catholic practice and doctrine of auricular confession— Mr Bingham was with him.

About half past 9. a quorum was formed and Habersham renewed a motion which had been rejected on Saturday, to suspend the discussion on the Bank Bill, and take up to report to the house, the bill from the Senate to repeal the sub-treasury— Chairman pronounced this motion not in order— Then M’Kay moved a reconsideration of the Saturday’s vote— Chairman said the House had decided last Session that Committees could not reconsider, and he must so decide though against his own opinion— M’Kay appeals—tie vote, four and 4. M’Keon absent. Still Habersham renews his motion. Chairman decides it not in order.— Appeal, and tie vote again. Thus passed the time till ten, when the house met. Turney made a thrust at the Speaker by moving an amendment of the Journal of last Friday, in stating the Speaker’s decision, confirmed by the house of my right to call for the reading of a resolution upon which I was required to vote, when Turney had objected to the reading. The entry upon the journal was that the Speaker had referred the question to the house— Turney insisted that he had not— After some altercation, Botts moved to lay Turneys motion to amend the journal on the table— I obtained leave to explain, and took the whole blame of the difficulty upon myself, for not having been in my seat when the Resolution was first offered, and therefore obliged to ask that it might be read, when called to vote upon it— Botts’s motion to lay Turney’s motion to amend the journal on the table was then carried by yeas and nays 100 to 80. It was petition day, and I moved and urged that the States should be called for petitions—but Cave Johnson moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the fortification bill—carried by 120 votes— No Petitions— Winthrop took the Chair and M’Kay commenced a Speech against the fortification Bill— The other members of the Currency Committee, returned to the Room of the Committee of Commerce, and debated the details of the Bank Bill, till half past 3 and adjourned till 10. to-morrow morning. When M’Kay finished his speech in the house he joined the Committee— For a few minutes all the members were present, and then it was settled to report the Section authorising the establishment of branches without the assent of the States— Botts offered a compromise amendment, scouted by Rhett, and not received. Several members were coming and going all the time— Numerous amendments great and small were moved— Some carried—others failed— Pope and Habersham are Waverly’s. No bottom— Rhett, M’Kay, and M’Keon are Eels— Hold them by the tail if you can— Cost Johnson—never sure of his attendance Evening visit from Benjamin Parsons author of a Book against the Trinity called the Christian Layman— Also from Coll. Thomas and Captain Buchanan— "

Tuesday  An almost sleepless Night, and tormenting restlessness from heat between flesh and skin all over the body— Mr Kavasales came this morning to intreat me, as he said he had been advised by members of Congress to solicit of President Tyler himself the appointment of chaplain in the navy for him, which I positively declined. He was importunate though meek and gentle but I was inflexible— I cannot countenance an appeal from a head of Department to the President upon a question of appointment, unless in a case of clear injustice— Mr Badger’s reason for excluding Kavasales is not satisfactory to me; but I am not sure he is wrong.— There were two messages received yesterday by the House from the President, and presented by the Speaker this morning— One recommending a revival of the supplementary neutrality act of March 1838 which expired in March 1840. and the other in answer to a call for correspondence relating to American Citizens banished from Canada, and prisoners in Van Diemen’s land— Of whom it seems there are none— The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Winthrop in the chair on the fortification Bill— Isaac D. Jones of Maryland took the floor, and the Committee on the Currency, met in the room of the Committee of Commerce. All the members of the Committee were there part of the time; but W. Cost Johnson took no part in the discussion, voted occasionally, and finally went away before the final questions were taken, leaving with me a request from two ladies, Miss Ellen Bruce and Miss Sally Bruce, for my autograph— At twelve, the time fixed for taking the fortification Bill out of Committee we returned to the house— Wise had moved to strike out the first section of the Bill which was rejected— In the house, Toland obtained an appropriation contingent for the pea patch of 50000 dollars from whig sympathy— Five or six of the Kentucky members, disgusted and alarmed at the late demonstrations of the Tyler party against Clay, finally voted against this bill after repeated motions to postpone it for a fortnight, and to lay it on the table— It was at last passed by yeas and nays 148 to 66. a majority of which no one had a conception; Wise having opposed it tooth and nail, from its first introduction— Wise gave notice that he should to morrow call up the Navy Ordnance Bill, and the house adjourned soon after two— The Currency Committee returned to their room, resumed the Bank Bill, went through with it making sundry Amendments as they proceeded, agreed to report it, and the Senates Bill to repeal the sub-treasury to-morrow morning, and adjourned without day. Botts had offered what he thought a compromise section about the establishment of branches with the assent of the States, but it was rejected una voce— Botts was engaged to dine with General Scott and I took him there— I barely screwed time to write to my wife— I had been this morning at the Treasury Department with Treasury Notes.

Winthrop from the Committee of Commerce, for the appointment of a Committee of nine members, to sit during the recess of Congress, and collect information, concerning duties on imposts and drawbacks to be reported preparatory to the revision of the tariff, and it had roused all the black bile of the South, and all the stupidity of the North, against protection— Wise and Pickens mounted their nullification and State right coursers—spurred their sides and darted off.— They debated it through the morning hour, when Wise moved to go into Committee of the whole on the Union— But he allowed Underwood Chairman of the Committee on the District to report a Bill for rechartering the District Banks— J. Sergeant to report from the Committee on the Currency the fiscal Bank Bill, and the bill from the Senate to repeal the sub-treasury, with amendments—read twice, referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and ordered to be printed, and D. D. Barnard, Chairman of the judiciary Committee, reported a Bill to establish a Bankrupt Law, which was also twice read and referred— He reported also by direction of the Committee a Resolution that it is inexpedient that Congress should act upon a bankrupt Law at their present Session; but he said that was not his opinion but the reverse. He thought Congress might discuss and adopt a bankrupt Law, at the present Session— A motion was made to lay the resolution on the table, and carried by yeas and nays—118 to 81. Wise then moved again to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union; which moved again to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union; which was done— R. W. Gilmer, late governor of Virginia, in the Chair— The Home Squadron Bill was taken up—a mere appropriation of more than 700000 dollars to maintain and man and victual a home squadron of 2. Frigates 4 smaller sailing vessels and 2. Steamers. Wise moved an amendment that the Secretary of the Navy might in case of need substitute other vessels instead of the Steamers; but I remonstrated earnestly against it; and after some verbiage, Wise withdrew his amendment.— There were half a dozen venomous part speeches made by the New-York Mobocracy, to apologize for voting for the Bill, which was reported to the house without amendment; passed to the third reading and passed by yeas and nays 184 to 8. The House adjourned at 2— I went into the Senate chamber, and found them debating on amendments proposed to the Bank Bill— After these H. Clay moved that the Bill should be reported with the amendments and printed— Dr Palfrey here this Evening. "

Thursday  Mrs Fairfield, mother of Sumner Lincoln Fairfield a poor Poet, in every sense of the word, sent to my seat in the house yesterday to call me out and solicit my subscription to her sons works in two octavo volumes— She said he was here dying of consumption, and starving poor— I asked her to call at my house this morning—she came, and I subscribed for the book, not worth 6. cents— The man has laboured hard in his day and generation; and for several years was editor of a monthly Magazine at Philadelphia now forgotten— His mother and his wife were then his recruiting officers for subscribers, and these works are the rakings and scrapings from that miscellany— At the house R. C. Winthrop’s Resolution from the Committee of Commerce for the appointment of a Tariff Committee to sit during the recess was debated nearly the whole day; first during the morning hour, when Governor Gilmer made a speech for and against it, signifying nothing.— He was followed by Charles Brown, an eternal bawler of nothings—the hour expired— Fillmore, pro forma moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the revenue bill, but said there was a document from the Treasury Department not yet printed which would be necessary in the consideration of the Bill— So Winthrop’s Resolution was refused— W. Cost Johnson made a very short and not very efficient speech in its favour— Wise sprung upon it with the fury of an uncaged Tyger consuming his hour in a bitter and malignant attack upon Eugenius A Nisbett of Georgia, a very handsome speaker and intelligent man, but mild, gentle, inoffensive and no duelist— Wise fears that the whole Georgia delegation, will flinch upon the Tariff subject, and he selected this man whom he knew he could bully and browbeat with impunity, to whip them all in— At the moment when Wise’s hour was out, Nisbett sprung up and said so, but Cushing at the same time addressed the Speaker and got the floor. Nisbett asked him to yield it, and many voices urged him to yield it— But Cushing was not to be diverted from hearing himself, and he controverted some of the weak points of Wise’s argument, while the house was all on tiptoe for Nisbetts counter personalities— When Cushing finished Nisbett replied to Wise—with some show of Spirit, and saying some severe things, but evidently cowed and overawed by the domineering and insulting tone and manner of Wise; who rejoined with tenfold bitterness and malice— Nisbett surrejoined almost supplicating forgiveness— Wise completely carried his point of breaking down Nisbett, and we shall see its effect on the whole Georgia delegation— This foray lasted till half past two O’Clock, and immediately after it closed the house adjourned— Mrs John Adams dined at her Aunt Mrs Hellens— I am directing copies of my Amistad Argument to the Members of the Massachusetts Senate— "

Friday  At the Treasury Department this morning, to speak a word for Russel Freeman, for the office of Collector of the Customs at New-Bedford— I had yesterday received a Letter from Mr Freeman, informing me that the recent collector whose term of Office would have continued till next December had resigned— I had no sooner pronounced the name of Freeman and New-Bedford, than Mr Ewing said to me rather crustily, that appointment is made— I believe the name of the person appointed is Allen— I asked him upon what terms he expected to negotiate his loan. He said he hoped at 5 per cent.— I asked him if he would not want more— He thought he should— The revenue from impost yields now short of a Million a Month— They were so long in making out my warrant for payment of Treasury Notes payable this day 2260 dollars with 113. for interest, that I requested them to send it when made out to my house— A feeble effort was made by Fillmore in the house to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the Bill relating to impost duties and drawbacks. But his document tables were not yet ready, and the house refused to go into Committee— So the day was consumed upon Winthrop’s resolution reported from the Committee of Commerce— Rhett ranted out his hour against the Resolution, and against all revenue by impost duties— King of Georgia made a half way speech, and John P. Kennedy of Baltimore a spirited and ingenious speech upon the tariff topic— There was a call of the house to which 179 first answered, and on the call of absentees 202. proceedings were then superseded; and there were 16 whigs absent, and 6 democrats.— King moved the previous question. Meriwether of Georgia moved to lay the Resolution on the table—lost by yeas and nays 88 to 113— There was a second to the previous question; but on the vote shall the main question be now put the yeas and nays were 101 to 100. and this was only because 4 whigs who had voted against it changed their votes— The Resolution passed by 106 to 104. and John M’Keon of New-York immediately moved a reconsideration, upon which he hoisted an anti-tariff hour speech. Mr Pickens moved to adjourn over to Monday, but upon a call for the yeas and nays withdrew the motion—adjourned a quarter past 3. Dr. Mease of Philadelphia at one of the doors of the Hall had asked me to introduce him to the President, I promised to call on him at Brown’s hotel at 1. to go with him. But precisely at that time came the call of the house and he could not leave it. He was here this Evening— So were General and Mrs Jesup, Jane and Captain Buchanan. "

Edward Southwick the man who visited me yesterday told me that he was a native of Massachusetts but now resided in the western part of New-York—that he was an abolitionist, and was now going to the South, to discuss the matter with them there. He asked me what I thought of it— I said the best thing he could do, was to turn round and go home— He asked if I thought there would be danger of harm to him— I said the least he could expect to get was a ducking. He said the late Governor of North-Carolina, had written to him that there was not the slightest danger for him in that State— I said North-Carolina was not so fanatical as some other Southern States, but he had better not trust himself even there.— I would advise him too to be very cautious in his conversation here, and to go home as soon as possible— This morning I called on the Postmaster general, concerning certain Post-Offices and Mail Routes— A Mr Jones called me out from my seat yesterday to complain of the discontinuance of a daily mail from Boston to Randolph, Stoughton and Bridgewater, and the substitution of a mail three times a week— He wanted me to sign a remonstrance against it, but I preferred speaking to the Postmaster general— He did not appear to be fully acquainted with the reasons for the change, but directed an examination, and will restore the daily mail if he can. I gave him a Letter from Lovell Bicknell of East-Weymouth resigning the Office of Postmaster there and recommending Dean Randell for the appointment—with two other Letters recommendatory of the same person— Mr Granger said another person had already been appointed— I read the Letter of Fisher A. Kingsbury, urging that if he should be removed a Taverner might not be appointed— Mr Granger sent for the remonstrance against Kingsbury and said he should remove him; but would prefer not to appoint a Taverner— I read to him the supplicating Letter of David Nye of Wareham— There was an application for his removal and a memorial praying that he might be retained. Mr Granger suspended judgment. I read the Letter from James Smith soliciting the Post-Office at Portsmouth N.H. but that appointment was made— I called at Brown’s Hotel— Took Dr Mease with me to the Capitol and promised to go with him to the President’s between 1. and 2.— I found the house taking the yeas and nays upon the motion to reconsider Winthrop’s Resolution— It was reconsidered and laid on the table— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Cushing in the Chair, on the Revenue Bill— Fillmore Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means made his hour’s exposition of the necessity for the bill, sundry amendments were offered; the Committee rose and the house adjourned at 1. O’Clock— I took Dr Mease to the President’s and introduced him— Then left him at the Department of State where he had certain enquiries to make— Towards Evening I went with Mary-Louisa, Jane Jesup and Theodore Talbot, and heard the Music at the Capitol.

I never suffered so much from the heat of the atmosphere, and am absolutely an invalid— Going to the second Presbyterian Church this morning with an umbrella over me, the rays of the Sun pierced through it, and felt like coals of fire upon my head.— I came near to fainting in church— The preacher was a stranger, and his text was from Isaiah 45.22. “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.” A minatory calvinistic discourse upon the usual platform, and in which I heard nothing worth remembering. There was a corner of a distant thunder shower, that passed over towards the close of the Sermon, after which the Sun came out again as intense as before. Captain Buchanan dined with us. After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read prayers for the 7th. Sunday after trinity, and preached from Romans 2.28. [“]For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward, in the flesh— 29. But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly: and circumcision is that of the heart: in the spirit, and not in the letter: whose praise is not of men, but of God”— Spirituality is the exclusive attribute of the Christian Religion— Circumcision, was of all religious institutions, the most physical and the most remote from spirituality— But Paul writing to the Romans to whose conversion to Christianity, the necessity of submitting to the operation of circumcision, was an insuperable obstacle, spiritualizes circumcision itself— He had quarreled with Peter, by insisting that the gentile converts should not be required to submit their persons to that rite, and in this epistle to the Romans, he points out the difference of motives for conversion to the gospel of the Jews and the Gentiles— In the first chapter he gives a hideous picture of the vices into which the heathens had fallen for want of a moral law.— And he dwells particularly upon the brutal vices of self-pollution— These vices were prohibited upon the severest penalties by the Jewish Law, nor is there a trace of the practice of them among the Jews, since the destruction of Sodom by fire from Heaven— The second eclogue of Virgil is a burning commentary upon the first chapter of Paul’s epistle to the Romans— The motive for their conversion, was moral principle— That of the Jews was because Jesus was the Messiah— The Son of David and of Abraham, in whom all the families of the Earth were to be blessed— Mr Hawley generalized the doctrine of his text, and descanted upon the familiar topic of the inefficacy of all religion of mere formality— There was a second thunder shower this evening, which approached nearer to us than that of the morning, but was still too remote for a saturating Shower— The excessive heat disqualified me for all useful labour— I barely collected a statement of the amount of duties of impost collected annually and of the annual expenditures from 1833 to 1840 inclusive.

The atmosphere has been again purified by the process of the thunder showers, and with Fahrenheit at 78 and a fresh breeze the air feels delightfully cool— I called at the Department of War, and delivered to the Secretary, Mr Bell a Letter from Mrs Derby, daughter of my deceased old friend Horatio Townsend, soliciting a warrant of Cadet at the West-Point Academy for her son George H. Derby, and several sheets of recommendations, to which I added a very warm one of my own. Mr Bell enquired if the young man resided in my district, I said he did not, but in that of Mr Hastings, who, the mother supposed was precommitted in favour of another person. Under the new census however, there would be a new organization of Districts, and then young Derby might be in a different District— Mr Bell said he would have his name for a positive appointment next June, as one of the ten supernumeraries, if he should remain in the Department— I presented also to Mr Bell the Letter of Mr William H. Weld of Boston, soliciting a Cadet’s Warrant for his Son, John Barrett Weld, whose name he said should be entered upon the files of the Department as a candidate. Going to the Capitol I stop’d at Major Nourse’s Office, and desired him to procure for me Cincinnati City 6. per cent bonds at 85 per cent I found the house in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Cushing in the Chair, upon the bill relating to duties and drawbacks. Lawrence of Pennsylvania, had moved to strike out Tea and Coffee from the Articles to be burdened with a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem, and was supporting his amendment with a speech of not much power— Atherton then moved to strike out the enacting clause of the Bill, and distilled off an hour of wormwood and vinegar upon the bill, and upon the administration. Campbell of South Carolina followed and offered an amendment to the bill, which was to repeal the specie paying sections of the sub-treasury— Halstead of New-Jersey answered Atherton, and Ward of New York replied to Halstead— Ward gave a totally perverted and deceptive history of the compromise act of 1833, and that roused me— I rose to speak for five or ten minutes, and at the expiration of the hour was arrested by Holmes of South-Carolina starting up and claiming the floor— Many of the members called upon me to go on, but I declined and took my seat— It was close upon 3 O’Clock the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— When I got home an old man of 75 named John M. White, keeper of Smith’s island light-house in Chesapeake-Bay, came weeping and wailing that they threaten to turn him out— Dr Mease was here this Evening— Returns to-morrow to Philadelphia— Dr Thomas was here, and prescribed for me warm baths, spirits of Nitre and cream of tartar; all of which I took— Mr Joslyn was also here, and will call again to-morrow morning.

My warm bath, Spirits of Nitre and Cream of Tartar have had little or no effect to relieve me from the cutaneous eruption, and unceasing titillation which torments me, and which the first cold day, will turn back upon my lungs and nerves— Mr Joslyn, who is a prime abolitionist, and a minister of the gospel, is also a member of an engraving company to engrave bank bills— He came this morning and shewed me numerous samples of their engravings, and of their devices to disable counterfeiters, and they are very ingenious.— He has taken out a patent for some of these inventions; and expects in the event of the establishment of a new bank of the United States, there will be a want for the use of them— Mr Homer also called to inform me that in the event of the enactment of a Bankrupt Law, there would certainly be commissioners, and he should be a candidate for appointment as one of them at Boston— He said he had given up all hope of melting the hard heart of Mr Ewing, but that Mr Tyler had promised him an office, as soon as he should have one to give— He said the reason why Mr Tyler had countermanded the twelve Clerks in the Land Office; being dismissed, because Huntington the new Commissioner had purposed to fill all the places with Clay partizans— I found the house in Session and in some confusion, without a quorum and under conflicting motions to take up different subjects for consideration— Weller of Ohio moved to adjourn and the yeas and nays were called— I voted no, and Weller withdrew his motion. At last the motion to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union prevailed by yeas and nays 84 to 81. Cushing took the chair and Holmes of Charleston, South-Carolina railed out his hour of bitter invective upon me— He was galled to the vitals by my exposure yesterday of South Carolina nullification, and the true history of nullification. Sergeant followed, taking up and enlarging upon my yesterday’s argument in his own way, taking care to give offence no where— Then came Gilmer of Virginia, with what was called his valedictory to the whig party.— He did not know what the whig party was, and complained of being proscribed himself, and of the President’s being proscribed by the whigs.— Mr Linn of New-York made a short cool sensible speech in favour of the bill, and Underwood of Kentucky opened his system for a retaliatory tariff—to retaliate upon all the world the high duties levied upon all the world upon tobacco— Triplett said a few words— James Irvin of Pennsylvania took the floor and the Committee rose— Kennedy gave notice of an amendment which he should offer as a substitute for the revenue Bill— Sundry petitions were offered and I began with the rest— But objection was immediately made— The Speaker decided in my favour— An Appeal was taken— No Quorum and the house adjourned— Dr Thomas here; and Captain Buchanan.

I was obliged this morning to hasten to the Capitol, to be there at the meeting of the house— As soon as the Journal of yesterday had been read, I rose to present the residue of the Petitions which I had on hand. The Speaker said there was an appeal from his decision that I had the right to present them— He took the question whether the decision of the Speaker should stand as the judgment of the house, and nearly all the members present rose in the affirmative—not ten in the negative— I presented them accordingly—one for a bankrupt Law was received and referred to the committee of the whole on the state of the Union— One from Wheeling, signed by 130 Citizens of Virginia, praying Congress to enact Laws that all the free coloured population may be sold as Slaves, or expelled from the Country— I said I had long hesitated whether I would present this petition; to the prayer of which nothing could be more abhorrent to my disposition— My respect for the right of petition was my only motive for presenting this— I asked the Speaker if this was one of those, which would be suspended by the rule of this Session— he said it would— Stanley objected to its being received, and said it was as inhuman and unjust as would be the general emancipation of Slaves— Fillmore then brought up his resolution for taking the revenue bill out of Committee at 12 O’Clock on Friday— M’Kay moved to strike out Friday and insert Saturday upon which there was long debate, but the amendment was rejected by yeas and nays, and the Resolution was adopted— Marshall of Kentucky had a petition for a bankrupt law which he said he was extremely anxious to present, because he should vote against the Law; but Pickens, and then another member objected and he could not get his petition received— His distress was ludicrous, and he called to the reporters to give notice that he had tried— Hopkins gave notice of his intention to submit for consideration some foolish amendment of the rules.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Cushing in the Chair, on the revenue bill.— The first hour speaker was James Irvin of Pennsylvania, adverse to the Bill, though he is a whig—he read and spoke out his hour and was followed by D. D. Barnard and he by Robert C. Winthrop, who made a very able argument against the details of the Bill, with preference for an amendment proposed by Mr John P. Kennedy. Randolph of New Jersey came next and had amendments to propose— Horace Everett made a yankee nutmeg speech, for the compromise and against the compromise, and for and against almost every thing else; all in mysterious whispers, addressing sometimes the South, and sometimes the North ludicrously requesting the Southern members not to hear him. At 3. Committee rose, and house adjourned— Walter Hellen dined with us, and John Connell was here in the Evening. "

The excessive heat has for some days subsided, but my parched skin and scorching eruption does not subside with it, nor yield to the Doctor’s warm bath, spirit of Nitre or Cream of Tartar lemonade— I found the house in Session, and Levy the delegate from Florida was offering a Resolution of 8 enquiries of the Secretary of War, relating to Indian hostilities in Florida. He had already introduced two Bills upon the subject which had been referred to the Committee on Military Affairs. Objection was made to taking the question upon his Resolution, and it lays over till to-morrow. Pickens had moved to go into Committee of the whole on the Revenue Bill; but had yielded the floor to Levy to present his Bills and Resolution— Several members implore Pickens to allow them to move for the reception of memorials, or to put Bills to Committees, but he was inexorable, and the house went into Committee, Cushing in the chair on the revenue bill. Saltonstall made his hour speech in favour of increasing the revenue and against the details of the present Bill— He spoke with great rapidity, but was cut off in the midst of a sentence about the great city of Lowell— Charles J. Ingersoll followed him in a very amusing, and most unprincipled speech—a continual taunt upon the impossibility that the whigs should raise any additional revenue, without rousing the people against them to over throw the administration— Ingersoll was followed by Pickens of South-Carolina, whose speeches sound like a tin canister half filled with stones rolling down an entry staircase— Him followed Habersham of Georgia, who gave notice of his intention to move by way of amendment a reduction of the proposed duties from 20 to 18 per Cent— It was half past 3. when Habersham finished and M’Keon of New-York took the floor— I moved that the Committee should rise, but the whigs had agreed last evening in Caucus to sit through the day and they refused to rise. But on taking the question there were only 102 voting no Quorum. I called on the Chairman to rise and report the fact to the house— Cushing after some resistance and counting the members present found them only 106. rose and reported to the house that the Committee had found themselves without a quorum— I then moved to adjourn, but they refused— A call of the house was ordered and proceeded till a quorum appeared when the Speaker left and Cushing resumed the chair, M’Keon rattled out his hour. W. W. Irwin moved a reconsideration of the order to take the Bill out of Committee at Noon to-morrow—the Committee rose and the house adjourned just before 6.— Mr W. H. Aspinwall of New-York, brought me a Letter from Abbott Lawrence. Dr Thomas and Captain Buchanan were here this Evening— "

                "text": "30. IV:30. Friday.  I had a sum of 2260 Dollars in Treasury Notes at 5 per cent interest which became payable on the 23d. instt. As I am paying interest at 6 per cent upon my own debts, it was bad economy to continue an investment which yielded only 5. They offered at the Treasury to renew the Notes at 5 2/5 but I declined and received a Treasurer’s warrant for 2373 dollars principal and one years interest on the Notes which my Son purchased for me last Summer. I called this morning at Charles J. Nourse’s Office, endorsed the Treasury warrant for 2373 dollars, and added 177 dollars in gold—which I paid for 3 bonds of the City of Cincinnati each for 1000 dollars, at 6 per cent interest payable half yearly on the 1st of May and of November at the Bank of North America Philadelphia— There are coupons of half-yearly interest appended to the bonds till May 1865. before which they are not redeemable with out the consent of the holder— I received the bonds numbered 336. 337. 338. yesterday enclosed in a Letter from J. Macalester at Philadelphia with notice that the account for the purchase was sent to C. J. Nourse who at my request had instructed them to make it for me.— I took his receipt for the money— The bonds are dated 8 July 1841 and the first coupon of interest payable 1. November next is 18:35— I was at the house before the Chaplain expecting that the call of Levy the Delegate from Florida, upon the Secretary of War would come up as unfinished business, and intending to move an amendment to his Resolution, but he was not even there. Barnard, Fillmore, Winthrop, J. P. Kennedy and W. C. Dawson each asked indulgence of the house to present Memorials or to have tables printed—objection made in every instance, and they took nothing by their motions. Irwin, made a short speech and withdrew his motion to reconsider the vote to take the questions in Committee on the revenue Bill this day at Noon— So the house went immediately into Committee of the whole on the Revenue bill, Cushing in the Chair— Wise spoke his hour out, feebly, and in a tone greatly subdued, against the Bill. There were but forty minutes left which Fillmore, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means occupied with sound argument in reply to objections against the Bill—from Noon till 3. the questions were taken upon amendments, almost all frivolous, and rejected counting by tellers.— One amendment insidiously offered by Cave Johnson to repeal the exemption from duty on Rail-road iron, was carried in Committee, but rejected by yeas and nays 93 to 119. in the House. When the Committee rose and reported the Bill, Stanly moved the previous question. Cave Johnson moved to lay the Bill on the table. lost by yeas and nays 92 to 123— Yeas and nays on taking the main question 113 to 96— The bill passed to be engrossed without yeas and nays— There was loud call to take the question on the bill now, but it was not engrossed, and a motion to adjourn was made and carried— Captain Buchanan was here this Evening— I received a Letter of the 26th. from my dear wife— "

Saturday  The excessive heat has passed off and the temperature of the atmosphere is genial and delightful: but my thorn in the flesh is not extracted nor are its symptoms mitigated— I reached the house again this morning in time to hear the prayer of the Revd. Mr French— The Speaker called the Committees for Reports— Then D. D. Barnard called for the orders of the day— The Bankrupt Bill from the Senate was taken up, and after a motion by Atherton to lay it on the table, rejected by yeas and nays 91 to 123 was referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and ordered to be printed; but a motion to print 5000 extra copies of Barnard’s Report failed.— The Bill relating to duties and drawbacks, otherwise called the revenue bill was read the third time and passed— George H. Proffit of Indiana, a high-toned but humoursome whig was quite obstreperous against it yesterday, because it includes tea and coffee among the articles to pay a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem, and because he had not been allowed to make a speech on sundry amendments which he had intended to propose— He had offered a Resolution for the adoption of a rule to take the yeas and nays, upon questions in Committee of the whole—one of the worst alterations that could be made; and now he broke out into a violent attack upon the precipitation with which this revenue bill has been driven through the house— Stanly answered him, somewhat in his own temper, and moved the previous question— The second to the previous question was taken by tellers and carried— On putting the main question the yeas and nays were 117 to 95 and the bill passed 116 to 101. Borden, Saltonstall and Winthrop voted against it— I hesitated much, before making up my mind to vote for it; but the necessity of providing the means to replenish the Treasury, to restore credit and to pay the public debt, outweighed all other considerations, especially as the Winter Session is close at hand, when any necessary modification of the act may be made— Proffit voted for the Bill, intending to move a reconsideration and then make a speech; but J. C. Clark was too quick for him, and moved at once a reconsideration and the previous question—the reconsideration was rejected 99 to 105— Wise then moved to amend the title and call it an act to violate the compromise of 1833. Made a speech of half an hour, and then withdrew his amendment— Bidlack the Jackass mimic of the lapdog made the same motion to amend the title; but his amendment was insulting to the house and he was not allowed to drone out his half-hour— The previous question was called and carried; and at 2. the house adjourned. I waited till 3. and then went to the top of the Capitol, and witnessed the communication by Telegraph of a Frenchman named Gonon— The other station was five miles distant, at Bladensburg— To my question who was queen Victoria’s prime Minister, they answered—Lord Palmerston.

Sunday  Public worship at the second Presbyterian Church, where a Stranger preached from Solomon’s Song, which he called the Canticles. 5.10: “the chiefest among ten thousand.”— A singular text upon which to construct a panegyric of Jesus Christ— The preceding words of the same verse are, “my beloved is white and ruddy,” and the remainder of the chapter is a description of his person in the wildest style of oriental imagery. Nor does it appear to be a suitable text for a commentary on the Saviour of the world, to call him the chiefest among ten thousand.— a mere General of a small army— The first among his peers— The Song of Solomon is an admirable specimen of romantic and dramatic antient literature— A parallel between the Hebrew and Grecian Schools of Literature would form a fine subject for a Dissertation when shall I have time to make the attempt? The preacher this morning, concentrated his whole discourse into a mere eulogy of Jesus, as if the whole duty of man consisted in the worship of him. But he closed by addressing his impenitent friends of the congregation and exhorting them very earnestly to repentance— After dinner at St. John’s church, Mr Humphreys of Annapolis, read prayers for the 8th. Sunday after Trinity, and preached from Luke 15.7. “I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.”— This is evidently a hyperbole— Taken literally it has the aspect of an invitation to sin for the sake of repenting; and so it has been insidiously construed by the profligates Chesterfield and John B. Rousseau. The Revd Mr Humphreys, who stands 6 feet 4 without his shoes, has a very cold manner of delivery, but his discourse was sensible and ration—like the preacher of this manner he has the habit of addressing his auditory by the denomination of my impenitent friend, a style very common in this part of the Country among the calvinistic preachers. In undertaking to assign the reasons why there should be more joy in heaven over one repenting sinner than over ninety nine just persons who need no repentance, he found a difficulty to reconcile with his creed, which is that there are no such just persons, all mankind being sinners more or less. And in this as in numberless cases the preacher was more successful in raising a difficulty than in removing it— I am still suffering with the complaint brought on me by the intense heat of the Season; and as this Evening came on finding my Spirits much depressed I walked the square round by the Navy and War Departments, and on my return home, stopped and returned the visit of S. Harrison Smith— I have so little heart for any intellectual labour that I spent all the leisure of this day in franking a number of copies of my Amistad Argument sent me from New-York, directed to lawyers in all the free States of the Union— I have still under consideration Mr Webster’s Note to the Chevalier Argaiz on the case of the Amistad Negroes.

I had only three or four, all abolition petitions to present, but I was desirous of presenting a resolution: the Journal of Saturday however had no sooner been read than John Sergeant, chairman of the select Committee on the currency moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union with a view to take up the Bank Bill from the Senate— I enquired if it was intended that no more petitions should be presented, and no more resolutions acted upon at the present Session of Congress— Several other members urged the allowance at least of the morning hour, to the reception of Petitions and Resolutions. But Sergeant persisted, and the house went into Committee. The Speaker called D. D. Barnard to the Chair, but he asked to be excused, and John C. Clark was substituted in his place— James I. Roosevelt from the City of New-York attempted to snatch the floor away from Sergeant, by moving the committee to take up the bankrupt bill—but Sergeant objected that the chairman had not announced the Committee to be in Session, though in fact this is never done. The Chairman however did so now; and Sergeant was too quick for Roosevelt in moving to take up the Senate’s Bank Bill— Roosevelt, failed in his dishonest attempt to get the floor, said he saw the house intended to give the go-by to the Bankrupt Bill, and the house laughed at him. Sergeant, after promising that the object of the special Session was to put the affairs of the Country in order, assumed that the concerns of the Government never could be managed well without the agency of a Bank and for proof went back to the institution of the Bank of North America by the Confederation Congress in December 1781. He then pursued the subject historically; but confined his argument almost exclusively to the position, that although one’s private opinion might be against the authority of Congress to establish a Bank, he might safely wave the constitutional question, as President Madison did in 1816.— After Sergeant, Robert M’Clellan of New-York wore out his hour against the Bill, as did Romulus M Saunders of North Carolina. Alexander H. H. Stuart of Virginia, vindicated the Bank of 1816. as a democratic establishment. Andrew Kennedy of Indiana spouted rabblement eloquence for his hour against the bill. John Thompson Mason of Maryland took the floor on the same side at 4 O’Clock: the Committee rose, and the house adjourned: Morgan gave notice that he would move a resolution on to morrow to take the bill out of Committee next Friday at 2 O’Clock. Captain Buchanan was here at tea— He has had a return of chills and fever— Evening visits from Mr Birdseye of New-York, and Mr. Allen of Maine, members of the house. "

Tuesday  I was again belated this morning in reaching the house, and missed the opportunity of presenting three abolitions, several others, not of the same character having been presented and received, by general consent— I found Levy the Delegate from Florida, attempting to get up for consideration his Resolution of enquiry upon the Secretary of War— I said I had an amendment to it to offer; whereupon all was drop’d by instinct, that is, by general consent— Levy, and Giddings and Randall of Baltimore came to my seat to enquire what my amendment was, and I gave it to each of them to read— The house will hear no more of Levy’s Resolution, unless he can slip it through in my absence— William M Oliver of New-York had given notice yesterday that he would this day offer a Resolution to amend the rules so that the yeas and nays may be taken in the house upon amendments rejected in the Committee of the whole— He offered the Resolution accordingly— Barnard objected to its reception, and Fillmore moved to lay it on the table. Much altercation whether it was received or not. Question upon laying on the table at last taken by yeas and nays, and carried 107 to 84.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, John C. Clark in the chair, on the Bank Bill from the Senate— John Thompson Mason of Hagerstown announced that he opposed the Bill on original grounds—all his own—his main argument was that the Legislature of Maryland had by the State Constitution no power to charter a Bank; whence he inferred that they could not grant to Congress the power to charter a bank in the District of Columbia; and of such materials was his hour’s speech composed. Charles Brown of Philadelphia followed for his hour; and said he should make a different speech from what he would have made if he would have made if he had got the floor yesterday— This is a sample of the man; an empty demagogue, but not crabbed or sour tempered— William H. Washington of North Carolina the youngest member of the house made a speech of 40 minutes in favour of the bill, worth more than all the declamations against it, past, present and to come— Fernando Wood, from the City of New-York came next against the Bill—he said he was not a talking man, but he talked nonsense and knavery for an hour, threatening to repeal the bill if it should pass, because a rabble of his constituents have passed resolutions that it shall be done.— William W. Payne of Alabama, closed the debate for the day, with violent denunciation of the unconstitutionality of a Bank; when he closed Morgan said that Payne had introduced into the Legislature of Alabama a Resolution instructing the Senators in Congress and requesting the Representatives to introduce and support a bill to establish a National Bank, with a Capital of 100 millions of dollars. Payne said he had nothing to say to that— A shout of laughter. "

Wednesday  I wrote this morning a short note to Mr Frye, who has my power of Attorney for the management of much of my property in this city requesting a supply, and received from him this evening a check on the Bank of Washington for 400 dollars— I finished this morning the despatch of about 250 copies of my Amistad Argument, sent me, directed to sundry lawyers in the free States from Maine to Michigan.— At the house, Morgan called up his resolution to take the Bank-Bill out of Committee next Friday at 12. O’Clock but the question now being on a motion to strike out the enacting clause of the Bill, no amendment to it can be moved, till that is decided; and as the debate upon it will be continued until the limited time for taking the bill out of Committee there will be no time even to offer amendments, and certainly none for debating them— After much underbrush conversation Morgan, after an ineffectual motion for a call of the house, rejected by yeas and nays 80 to 89. modified his resolution so as to fix next Tuesday, instead of Friday to take the Bill out of Committee; rejected by yeas and nays 55 to 136. Sergeant then renewed Morgan’s original resolution and moved the previous question— Gilmer moved to lay the Resolution on the table Lost, yeas 96 nays 106. and the Resolution was carried 104 to 97— Three Messages from the President were read one communicating a remonstrance from the French Minister to the Secretary of the Treasury against the revenue bill pending before Congress—an application from the Postmaster General for an appropriation to finish the Post-Office building, and one communicating the arrival of the Statue of Washington by Greenough— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, John C. Clark in the Chair— Bank Bill— John M. Botts made an hour speech ardent for the bill— He maintains that the constitutional power of Congress to establish a Bank is derived from the power of coining money and of regulating the value thereof— He reviews the objections of Jefferson against the Bank in 1791. and shews them to have been frivolous and absurd. Aaron V. Brown of Tennessee, George H. Proffit of Indiana, Milton Brown of Tennessee and Roger L. Gamble of Georgia followed each for one hour; the first against—Proffit against the bill but promising to vote for it M. Brown and Gamble for it. He closed about 4. p.m. a motion was then made to rise— No Quorum. The Chairman reported the fact to the house— I moved to adjourn—yeas and nays 17 to 70. Call of the house 64 to 23. Call continued till 129 members answered— J. C. Clark resumed the Chair. T. F. Marshall who had taken the floor declined speaking from indisposition— Weller—M’Keon—Alford and Hubbard consumed four hours— Pope took the floor, the Committee rose, and the house after 9. adjourned— Long thunder shower— I came home in a hack with R Chapman, and torrents of rain. Found Walter Hellen at our house. "

Botts moved to lay the Resolution on the table, which was carried by yeas and nays 99 to 79:— Committee of the whole on the state of the union John C. Clark in the chair on the fiscal bank bill. Mr Pope of Kentucky made his speech of an hour in favour of the Bill, and was succeeded by Thomas F. Marshall of the same State— It was Noon, and I was just then called to attend a meeting of the Massachusetts delegation in the chamber of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, to consult whether they would deem it expedient to offer or adopt amendments to the Bank Bill, and if any, what they should be.— Borden, Burnell, Cushing—Hudson, who spoke for Baker and Briggs, Saltonstall and Winthrop attended. Calhoun and Hastings are unwell. Parmenter was not notified— There was nearly an hour of discussion, but no agreement of opinion upon the subject of amendments, and I was finally chosen, without instructions to represent the delegation at a larger meeting held at one O’Clock at the same place, of one representative from the whig portion of the delegations from all the States. At this Meeting I was chosen chairman, and sundry amendments were agreed upon to be offered by J. Sergeant, Chairman of the currency Committee, who said he had received intimations that amendments might be proposed from the house without endangering the Bill— I returned to the house at 2. p.m. just as Wise was closing his hour speech against the bill—he had followed Marshall, whose speech was against the compromise clause— Bidlack had preceded Marshall against the Bill; Dean of Ohio raved like a maniac for a full hour against the bill and the whig party— Richard W. Thompson of Indiana, followed with a very spirited and sensible Speech in its favour.— I proposed a series of amendments, but was arrested in the midst of the argument by the expiration of the hour. Isaac D. Jones of Maryland followed me, in support of the Bill. Charles J. Ingersoll against it. Daniel D. Barnard, gave a general argument upon the necessity of banks for currency circulation and exchange. About 9. Motion for Committee to rise—rejected— No Quorum. caucus in the chamber of the Committee of foreign Affairs—determine to admit no amendments— Robert M. T. Hunter discourses an hour upon the conflict between capital and labour. Pickens takes the floor and yields it to Underwood, who promises to hold it only ten minutes then half an hour, and absorbs the whole. Roosevelt takes the floor— The Committee rose for want of a quorum, and at 5 minutes before 11. house adjourns by yeas and nays 49 to 37. "

Clark in the Chair—at 11. precisely his hour expired, and Thomas Butler King of Georgia, in competition with F. W. Pickens obtained the floor, and spoke about three quarters of an hour— He gave an ingenuous account of the change of his opinion from an undoubting conviction that a Bank was not essential to the regulation of the currency, to a decision still more clear that it was— William Cost Johnson, who has been absent from his seat during the whole discussion upon this Bill in the house, till yesterday, spoke for about 10 minutes chiefly to say that although he had been a member of the Committee on the Currency, and had agree to the Bill reported to the house, he was also willing to vote for the Bill now before the Committee.— At the last moment before 12 James A. Pearce of Maryland began to speak, and proceeded until silenced by vociferous call to order— The first question taken was on the motion to strike out the enacting clause— Rejected by Tellers 87 to 136. Then came the propositions of amendments—two or three were moved to the first section by others, upon which when the questions were put, not more than half a dozen voices answered aye, while the negatives sounded like peals of thunder. I saw that the caucus decree of last Evening was in full operation.— I nevertheless proposed the amendment of which I had given notice yesterday to the first section, and one other— They were rejected like the rest.— I then said that observing the repugnance of the Committee to admit any amendment, I should withdraw all the others that I had proposed, except that in the 16th Article of the 11th. Section, respecting the assent or dissent of the State Legislatures to the establishment of branches.— That question only was taken by tellers, and lost 45 to 110. T. F. Marshall who had first moved the amendment in terms different from mine, requested me to move it, because Mr Clay felt it as personally offensive from him. I offered accordingly his amendment and afterwards no other. The opposition members offered many— Underwood all his. all rejected. Sergeant moved the Committee to rise and report the Bill, without offering any of the amendments which had been agreed upon in the delegation Caucus yesterday— The bill passed to engrossment 129 to 97. and passed, read by its title 128 to 97. Upon which there was shouting and stamping, and clapping of hands in the gallery. Reconsideration was rejected pro forma: and the house adjourned a quarter before 3.

He comes here on business of his own, and said he wished an introduction to Mr Rufus Choate, one of the Senators from Massachusetts— I told him I would call for him this morning at 9. O’Clock and go with him to Mr Choate’s lodgings, and there introduce him, which I accordingly did— Mr Choate who lodges at Dr. Sewall’s at first sent word that he was very much engaged; but I sent my name, and he came down— I introduced my young quaker friend to him, and left them together— The house fell into a snarl in a struggle finally successful to take up the bill from the Senate to repeal the sub-treasury—reported by the currency Committee to the house, with amendments. Sergeant moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up that Bill— W. Cost Johnson proposed the District Bank Bill— D. D. Barnard, the Bankrupt Billthe Bill to amend the act to provide for taking the 6th Caucus— After much confusion this last was taken up, but Alexander Randall had an amendment to it to offer, but was not in his seat, and coming in shortly after was not ready— The Bill was laid aside, and the Bankrupt bill taken up and read through—immediately after which a motion was made to lay it aside and take up the repeal Bill— Barnard said he would not press the further consideration of the Bankrupt-Bill now, but the vote could not be carried to take up in Committee the repeal Bill.— After an excessively confused wrangle, and a hot cross-fire of calls to order a motion was made and carried for the committee to rise, Tillinghast the chairman gave the Chair to the Speaker, and Sergeant moved to discharge the Committee of the whole from the further consideration of the repeal Bill. Bidlack objected that as a money Bill, it must by the rules be first discussed in Committee of the whole— The Speaker decided that the motion to discharge the Committee of the whole from the consideration of a Bill was not debatable— I appealed from the decision, but the Speaker refused to entertain the appeal. The previous question was carried—on putting the main question, I did not vote, and asked to assign my reason. The Speaker said it was not in order. The vote by yeas and nays to discharge the Committee was 103 to 102. and it was carried by Sollers changing his vote.— Then came the question whether the Bill discharged took precedence of all other business in the house. The Speaker decided that it did. Hopkins appealed; but on learning from the Clerk that the same bill, was the first, in order on the Calendar withdrew the appeal, which I renewed. but the Speaker refused to receive the appeal. Next followed a Cock and a Bull squabble between James A. Pearce, and John T. Mason, two members from Maryland— Then a speech of an hour from Gordon of New-York and another from Shields of Alabama, both against the Bank bill— I presented the Petition from the Stone-cutters, which was referred to the Committee of ways and means and near half past 3 the house adjourned.

[“]Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling, and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.” How can this text be reconciled with the doctrine of free grace and predestination?— What diligence can make the calling and election sure if all that man can do, is worthless and unavailing? The institution of preaching itself presupposes that the conduct of men is influenced by persuasion— Here is exhortation, to give diligence, one of the greatest of human virtues, and cheering encouragement to the hearer that in the exercise of that virtue—he shall never fall— Is it not in a moral point of view, a pernicious doctrine, that the salvation of man depends not on himself or his own exertions, but upon the atonement? is not its tendency more to recklessness, to despair—to suicide, than to saving faith? Is not the doctrine of vicarious punishment and virtue an impeachment both of the Justice and the goodness of God?— Afternoon at St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley read prayers for the ninth Sunday after Trinity, and Dr Burroughs, rector of the episcopal church at Portsmouth New-Hampshire preached from Romans 11.21. [“]For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.” This chapter is addressed especially to the Gentiles, and the apostle in his parallel between the two classes of his converts, Jew and Gentile, is not a little puzzled with his own argument. He assumes that the Jews have forfeited their right to salvation, by the rejection of Christ, but maintains that God has reserved a portion of them to himself and that the exclusion of the rest is the instrumental cause of the admission of the Gentile world to the blessings of Christianity. He compares the Jewish Nation under the Mosaic Law to an Olive tree—and the Gentile world to a wild Olive tree; and pursuing the figure supposes the branches of the Olive tree to have been cut off, and the branches of the wild Olive to have been engrafted on the trunk of the Olive; and then comes the warning to the gentile convert—if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee— Dr Burroughs urged that the admonition was in like manner applicable to us, and earnestly contended that vice and iniquity did so abound that we must look for the most fearful judgment of God.— There was something of bathos in the first specification of complaint against the manners of the age, consisting in the profanation of the Sabbath—but it passed— Walter Hellen and Mary Cutts were here— And Dr Thomas, who prescribed Diet drink, for my complaint— "

Jones presented factious Resolutions of a democratic meeting in Fauquier County, Virginia, against the extra Session of Congress and all the great measures proposed since it met— Jones moved they should be laid on the table and printed— Cuthbert Powell who represents the Fauquier District, said that the Democratic meeting amounted to 33 persons—that their Resolution threatening the repeal of the Bank Law was strongly contested among themselves, and was not the sentiment of the People of the District— The Resolutions were laid on the Table, but the motion to print was rejected by yeas and nays 107 to 76. Bryan Y. Owsley of Kentucky offered a joint resolution to adjourn on Wednesday the 18th.

So utterly prostrate is the right of Petition in the house; and so ashamed are they who submitted to the expedient of excluding all petitions to keep out the abolitionists, that any record of their prostitution should remain— A multitude of other resolutions were offered, very few of which were adopted.— Robert Tyler came with a message, and the house was all agog for a veto of the Bank-bill— It was to announce that the President had signed a Bill—to continue some charitable corporation at Alexandria—whereupon the house burst into a fit of laughter. The Sub-treasury repeal bill was now taken up, and discussed by Pickens, Hiram P. Hunt, Meriwether and Steenrod. At 4. O’Clock John Hastings of Ohio, took a quire of paper out of his pocket, and began to read— I came home and dined, and returned to the house at half past 5— I had left not more than 50. members in the house— When Hastings finished his reading— Giddings moved the previous question— There was a call of the house, and 206 members had answered— I arrived just in time to vote upon an appeal from a decision of the Speaker, by James W Williams of Maryland— The decision was sustained— The bill passed by 137 to 87. Halsted moved a reconsideration, and amidst riotous confusion told the whole story, how the bill passed by the spurious representation from New-Jersey— Adjourned a quarter past 6. Hoarse sore throat.

IV:15 Tuesday  Wise came into the house this morning and asked leave to have his name recorded in favour of the bill to repeal the sub-treasury, passed last evening—but was refused— D. D. Barnard moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the bankrupt bill— Wise wished to take up the amendments from the Senate to the Navy pension-appropriation bill; but Barnard persisted, and by 77 to 57. the house went into Committee, Tillinghast in the Chair, and Barnard made his speech of a short hour in support of the Bill— There is no better subject for popular declamation than the distressed condition of hopeless insolvency— But the bill is a sponge. He said there were 500000 of these hopeless insolvents in the United States— Nisbett of Georgia followed with a neat and elegant speech for the bill— Gordon of New-York snarled against it— This man in speaking keeps butting his head against the air, like a he goat— Roosevelt from the city of New-York followed him in a remarkably pleasant, good tempered speech, gracefully delivered— Sampson Mason of Ohio took the same side, though he said he had long been undecided whether to vote for or against the Bill— The debate was very languid— Hardly any one seemed willing to say any thing on the subject, and the house was nearly deserted.— At last Charles G. Ferris from the city of New-York, mustered courage to make a very sensible and not ineloquent speech against the Bill— Ferris contrasts with his colleague Roosevelt. He is a heavy, coarse, vulgar looking man, with a slouching dress, and slovenly deportment; but civil, courteous, and unpresuming. He speaks seldom, but very well, and in pointing out the radical defect of this bill dwelt upon its great characteristic feature, the total disregard of the creditor— I believe no bankrupt Law, can in this Country be of much benefit to the class of Creditors— The Bankrupt Law of 1800 operated as a receipt in full for some hundreds of men who had large debts and nothing to pay— This bill will pass some thousands through the same process— There has been for forty years since that Law expired an overpowering prejudice against any bankrupt Law; and now by a sudden and unaccountable revulsion there comes a whirlwind to carry it through— Mr Salstonstall took the floor—the Committee rose, and at half past 3. After dinner Mr Gonon the Telegraph man came to claim my assistance— In January last he presented a Memorial to Congress, proposing the establishment of Telegraphic signals upon his system, from Washington to New-York— It was referred in the Senate to their Committee of Commerce, who on the 18th. of February last made a favourable report upon it, but nothing further concerning it was done— On the 29th. of last he presented a second memorial, which was in Senate referred to the Committee on Military Affairs. He says that its Chairman, Mr Preston thinks that the appropriation must come from the house— Dr Thomas here. "

John Foote and James Kelly, are two of the Stone-cutters who have been employed on the public buildings and are now without work for want of appropriations— They came now to complain of a new grievance. John Snyder, a member of the house from Pennsylvania, yesterday (the day before) offered a Resolution, that hereafter all repairs on fortifications on public buildings shall be made by contract, let out to the highest bidder— It is doubtful whether he intended to include in his Resolution, the works on the public buildings in this city: but these men were alarmed and resort again to me for aid and protection. They said it would if adopted put the workmen wholly at the mercy of the contractors, and make their bread depend upon their votes at elections; as it had under the last administration— I told them I would see what I could do for them— At the House—Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Tillinghast in the Chair— Bankrupt Bill— Fessenden, a promising young man from Portland Maine, made an hour speech in its favour— His slender form and pallid face indicate a feeble constitution ill suited to the Latitude of Portland. He speaks with great facility, without elegance—plain sound sense, but without striking thought or imagery, wit or humour always grave—always calm, always moderate—never very impressive—never original in thought or sentiment— He was followed by Archibald L. Linn from Schenectady New-York a young Lawyer of prepossessing appearance, who assailed several of the details of the Bill—which was defended by Nathaniel G. Pendleton of Cincinnati Ohio, the successor of Dr. Duncan, and a complete contrast to him in character— Pendleton is a finished gentleman, studious of dress, studious of language, with a complexion of more than Indian darkness, and eyes black as coals, yet sparkling with good humour— He was for the bill, in whole and in all its parts.— Joseph Trumbull of Hartford Connecticut, was more discriminating, and objected to some of the details, and Underwood of Kentucky was still more dissatisfied with it— He had several amendments to propose; he did not expect they would be adopted; and if not he should vote against the Bill— John Moore of Louisiana closed the debate of this day in favour of the Bill, and at half past 2 the Committee rose and the house adjourned in the midst of a copious rain— There was a whirlwind in part of the Pennsylvania avenue, which took off part of the roof of the central market. Walter Hellen was here this Evening— St. George Tucker and Mr Sedgwick of New-York were on the floor of the house this morning. Mallory of Norfolk, presented Resolutions of a meeting at Portsmouth, and made his Declaration of War against the whigs in the house. "

At the house, Wise, chairman of the Committee of Naval Affairs, reported concurrence with the Amendments of the Senate, to the Navy Pension Appropriation Bill— I offered as amendment to the Senate’s amendment a proviso to except from the provisions of the act prohibiting the allowance of pay and pension at the same time, persons to whom the allowance is made by special acts of Congress rejected 64 to 100— House concur in the amendments of the Senate— Barnard moves a Resolution to cease debate, and take the Bill out of Committee at noon to-morrow— Wise moved as amendment 3.

Pope was speaking against the bankrupt bill—following Hiram P. Hunt in favour of it, who had succeeded Milton Brown— Elisha H. Allen of Maine came next and last for this day for the Bill, and a quarter before 3 the Committee rose. Barnard gave notice that he should move again to morrow morning to take the Bill out of Committee at Noon. Wise moved to discharge the Committee of the whole from the further consideration of the Bill. Gilmer? was bristling up against it, till I reminded him that there was no quorum to vote and the house adjourned— Judge Randall, and two brothers were here this Evening— "

Call at the Treasury Department, to enquire for the warrant for payment of the Bill of Exchange, which I left yesterday at the Navy Department— It had not been received— At the City Hall— No one at the Office of the Register of Wills— House. Sergeant moved that when the house adjourn’d it should be over to Monday—carried by yeas and nays. 112 to 49. Barnard moved his Resolution to take the Bankrupt Bill out of Committee at 2. O’Clock p.m. this day, and carried it 74 to 61. John T. Mason attempted to introduce the proceedings of an Anti bank meeting; but could not prevail on Barnard to allow him. Nor could Graham who had a Resolution to offer about placing the statue of Washington just received from Greenough, at Florence.— Nothing would do, but to take the Bankrupt Bill out of Committee and pass upon it at two O’Clock— So the house went immediately into Committee upon it, and James I. M’Kay made a sensible speech against it. Birdseye of New-York preceded him. I went again to the City Hall— The Register of the Orphan’s Court was there, but not the judge, who he said had postponed holding his Court till the 24th. of this month. I shewed Michael Leary’s Letter with the certificates that he is the father of Jeremy to Mrwho said he had no doubt that the judge would receive it as authentic evidence of the fact, and would allow the charge in the Administrators account for payments to the father— When I returned to the house, M’Kay was about closing his speech against the bankrupt bill.— Immediately after which Trueman Smith moved the Committee to rise; for the house to reconsider the vote to take the bill out of Committee at 2 O’Clock— Wise objected and resorted to points of order saying that there had been too much dilatory shuffling on this subject, which nettled some of the whigs; but Barnard coolly assented to Trueman Smith’s motion. I asked Winthrop what all this meant— He said the Kentucky and Indiana delegations would vote against the Bankrupt bill, if the veto on the Bank should come in, and will not vote for it, while the veto is impending— Wise resorted to all his captious rules of order in vain. The Committee rose— Trueman Smith moved his reconsideration and it was carried—101 to 98. Atherton moved a reconsideration of the vote to adjourn over to Monday. Losttoand the house went into Committee again. Wise squirted at the whigs like a retreating skunk. Briggs and Morgan replied to him, for the Bill— White of Indiana discoursed on the same side. James W. Williams of Baltimore County against it, and proposed a substitute bill. He was encountered by Augustus R Sollers of the same State— Committee rose before 3.— Adjourned. M’Geery, an Irishman came to offer his services as a Tutor— I called on the Postmaster General with a petition for a removal and appointment of a Postmaster at Plympton— Hague the Astrologer here— Dr Winna. Elisha Whittlesey, with Mr Buckland—Mrs Thornton and Mary Talbot. "

The President of the United States, the members of his Cabinet, and all the members of both houses of Congress had received invitations to visit the line of battle ship Delaware lying off Annapolis, this day— Commodore Morris who is going out in command of her, had given me an additional verbal invitation, and I had concluded to go, until the feud between the President, and the two houses of Congress, festering ever since a special Providence placed John Tyler in the Presidential Chair came to an issue, by the passage of the Bank Law, which it is known he intends to negative— The excitement in both houses, and in public is so great that I thought it no time for festivity or hollow hearted pageantry. The President himself appears to have become sensible, that this exhibition of himself to public gaze and outward display of adulation was ill suited to the real feelings of the time, and did not go.— The house yesterday, adjourned over to Monday for this frolic, but the Senate refused to adjourn and sat this day as usual. I called at the Treasury Department for the draught in payment of the Bill of exchange— The Warrant from the Secretary of the Navy had been received, but Mr Ewing the Secretary of the Treasury was indisposed, and had gone to his house leaving the warrant unsigned— I received however this afternoon the draught on the Receiver General at Boston, for 1500 dollars, which I endorsed, payable to Schuyler Sampson Plymouth, or his order, and enclosed to him. Mr William Morse of Hanover, Massachusetts, a Constituent of mine, had written to me, requesting a copy of the Bankrupt Bill, as it passed the Senate— I went to the Office of the National Intelligencer to enquire for it, as I thought it had been printed in that paper— It had not, but Mr Gales gave me a copy of the printed bill itself. Mr Gales told me much about the abortive negotiations with the President to prevail upon him to sign, or at least not to veto the Bank Bill. He says that the compromise clause introduced at the last gasp in the Senate Bill was in the handwriting of Secretary Ewing— The familiar Spirit of Socrates was wont to advise him negatively; not to act. Is not this the true Spirit for the present occasion— This afternoon Mr Ezekiel Jones, Captain of a Revenue cutter, whom I saw at Scituate in 1839 called on me. He has been stationed on the Coast of Florida; has now brought the vessel into Baltimore to be repaired— He had sometime since written to me requesting my assistance to procure an appointment in the same service for his son, and he now repeated the request— I told him that the Secretary of the Treasury had assured me that there was at present no vacancy in the revenue service Thomas Hague who styles himself and Astro-meteorologist, was here, and put many questions to me for his horoscope— He is an Irishman, and publishes monthly a small pamphlet under the title of a horoscope full of silly prognostications from the stars about individuals, and me among the rest— He intimated to me that I should be seriously sick in my 78th. and again in my 81st. year, and gave me a copy of his horoscope for the present month— "

I have never known it to fail in this city from the 15th. to the 20th. of August inclusive— This morning at the 2d. Presbyterian Church Mr Moore preached from John 8.51 [“]Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.”— This is a part of that most remarkable scene in the temple, when Jesus announced himself to the people as pre existent to Abraham—as the light of the world—as proceeded forth and come from God, and asserting his eternity, as I am—the name by which Jehovah had named himself to Moses—I am!—no past—no future, one eternal existence, personified— And in this same discourse, after defeating the plan to entrap him into a collision with the Levitical law in the case of the woman taken in adultery, he had exasperated to the highest pitch the people whom he addressed, against himself, charging them with seeking to kill him, and reviling them as liars, thieves, murderers—among the most provoking things of this whole discourse was this solemn and emphatic averment that a man who should keep his saying should never see death— How could he be understood but literally— How could they believe but that he was a maniac—or had a devil? how could it end otherwise than it did by their taking up stones to cast at him.— Of all this Mr Moore took no notice— He explained nothing— Not even what was meant by never seeing death, or by keeping his saying— There is indeed a sense in which this glorious promise is true beyond all controversy— Were it possible for a man to perform all the precepts of Christ, he would be perfect, as God in Heaven is perfect, and Death to him would have no sting— In the afternoon at St John’s Church, Mr Hawley read prayers for the tenth Sunday after Trinity and a delicate, feminine young gentleman, a stranger preached from 2. Corinthians 5.20—the latter part of the verse—[“]we pray you, in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.”— In the former part of the verse, Paul speaking of the Apostles says— Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us—which the preacher modestly thought proper to omit: but in addressing his auditory, he assumed as of course that they were in a state of enmity with God, and told them so— This commonplace of gospel preaching, would have been more suitable, from a spiritual teacher, less perfectly satisfied with himself. Mr Hawley gave notice of two lectures to be delivered, the first to morrow evening in Dr Lawrie’s church upon the religious ceremonies of the Jewish Law— Mrs Talbot was here to visit the Ladies after the morning service at the Roman catholic church.

Sundry Petitions were presented in the house this morning, and Hopkins offered a resolution of instruction to the Committee on Post-Offices and Post-roads which was adopted. Weller presented the proceedings of an anti-bank Democratic meeting in Ohio, and John W. Jones offered a similar document from the Isle of Wight in Virginia— Llandaff W. Andrews a passionate and bad tempered Kentucky whig objected, and said he would object to every thing not strictly in order— Jones complained about stifling the voice of the People, but submitted— Snyder offered a Resolution for adjournment next Monday; but some one said wait for the veto— Barnard made half a dozen motions to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, but yielded the floor for various other motions, among which was one of W. W. Irwin from the retrenchment Committee, for leave to sit during the recess of Congress, with power to send for persons and papers, and to report at the next session by bill or otherwise— Andrews moved to lay the resolution on the table—carried by yeas and nays 139 to 40.— The census bill was taken up and passed with Randall’s amendment to print 20000 copies of the compendium—carried by yeas and nays 121 to 63. At last the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the Bankrupt Bill— Tillinghast in the Chair. Isaac E. Holmes of Charleston S. Carolina made a long-studied hour speech against the Bill— Holmes is a pompous Orator fancying himself a very profound statesman—he has a pickpocket habit of looking askance from the corner of his eyes while he is speaking, and he affects deep logical deduction— Francis James of West-Chester Pennsylvania, a plain downright wet quaker followed him for the bill, succeeded by John Sergeant, and he by Jacob M. Howard of Michigan. Their speeches were made with less than 40 members in the hall— The flock were in the Senate to hear the veto upon the Bank-bill, delivered there this day at Noon. When Howard finished, no other member rose to speak. Barnard moved the Committee to rise, and gave notice that he should to-morrow Morning move to take the Bill out of Committee at Noon— Wise moved to amend the motion for the Committee to rise, by adding “and report the Bill.”— The Speaker at first decided that this amendment was in order, and afterwards that it was not— The Committee rose and the house adjourned shortly after 2. When the veto message was read in the Senate there was some slight disorder in the galleries, whereupon T. H. Benton made a ridiculous scene, till a man was taken into custody, and the doughty knight of the stuff’d cravat abated his manly wrath— The veto message and its inevitable consequences will utterly prostrate the administration, and the party by which it was brought in. It surrenders the Country to the profligate political swindlers so recently driven from power! There is a Providence in the fall of a sparrow. Dr Thomas and Walter Hellen were here this Evening. "

Tuesday  I called this morning at the Department of State, and found in close conference with him Mr Frothingham, heretofore cashier of the United States branch Bank at Boston. I returned to Mr Webster the Note to the Spanish Minister Argaiz which he had sent to me for my perusal; and made enquiry when the answer from the Department was to be expected—to a Resolution of the House offered by me, calling for the aggregate returns of the census— He sent for Weaver from whom it appeared that instead of the document called for by my resolution he had commenced under it a new and different aggregate which has employed two clerks ever since, and is now not more than two thirds finished. And now provision is made in a bill supplementary to the census act which passed the house last Friday for printing 20000 copies of the Aggregate for which my Resolution called, leaving the resolution to apply only to the new and nearly worthless summary undertaken by Weaver to defeat my purpose. All which is done for the purpose of giving some paltry printing job to the publishers of the Globe— Before I went to the House, Mr Connell called on me, He is yet here, soliciting the appointment of Surveyor in the Custom-house at Philadelphia. Bela Badger an electioneering politician too notorious was nominated for that office some weeks since; but the Senate demur to the nomination— Connell is ruined by luckless bank and railway speculations, and has become a cormorant for Office— In the house Barnard offered and carried his Resolution to take the Bankrupt Bill out of Committee at Noon this day— In Committee he replied to the various objections against the Bill—followed by Saltonstall for it, and a final blast of Sprigg of Kentucky against it. At Noon the debate ceased: a multitude of foolish amendments were offered and all rejected. he offered one himself to strike out the first of November next and insert the 1st. of February for the commencement of the act, and at my suggestion to strike out the words, and no sooner—with this single amendment the Bill was reported to the house where Clifford moved as an amendment to the amendment a proviso, saving the State insolvent Laws, which was carried by yeas and nays 99 to 96. And then Underwood, moved to lay the bill and amendments on the table. Carried 110 to 97 and at half past 2 the house adjourned. Jovial evening party of whigs at Mr Daniel Webster’s on Capitol Hill— Conversation with Barton of Virginia Supper—Champagne, when I returned home I found Mrs Hellen and Walter, and Mr and Mrs Moody here— Music by Mrs Moody.

Gamble of Georgia moved a reconsideration of the vote of yesterday which laid the bankrupt bill on the table; whereupon Weller of Ohio moved a call of the house upon which the yeas and nays were taken 170 to 7. The call consumed upwards of an hour, and was pursued to the closing of the doors and windows, and the receiving of excuses. 206 answered to their names— Cave Johnson moved to lay the motion for reconsideration on the table— There was some parley about excusing Barton of Virginia, who was in the house and voted for the call, and then retired, indisposed—that question too was taken by yeas and nays 113 to 74. a party question! About half the alphabet of absent Members had been excused when Botts moved to suspend further proceedings on the call— Yeas and Nays again 111 to 76.— Then on Cave Johnson’s motion, to lay the motion for reconsideration on the table 92 to 111— Then on the reconsideration. Carried 108 to 98— Then the question came back on Underwood’s motion to lay the Bill and Amendments on the table. He offered to withdraw it, if he could at the same time offer an amendment, which the Speaker declared inadmissible, the previous question having been demanded. Refusal to lay the Bill and amendments on the table Yeas and Nays 99 to 112— Sollers then moved a reconsideration of the vote yesterday which adopted Clifford’s amendment to the amendment—and moved the previous question— Just at this point King of Georgia announced the arrival of John T. Stuart, a member just elected from Illinois, to whom the Oath was administered by the Speaker— Reconsideration carried 116 to 93. Clifford then modified his amendment by an additional clause— Voted down 90 to 119.— Then came the question on the engrossment of the amendment reported by the Committee of the whole postponing the commencement of the bill from 1. November to 1. Feb, next and the passage of the Bill to the third reading— Carried— Wise moved a call of the house, 212 members being present, to see who would dodge the question. Call refused by yeas and nays 89 to 116— And then under the previous question the bill was passed 110 to 106. Morgan moved a reconsideration and the previous question yeas and nays 99 to 115— Committee of the whole, Boardman in the Chair on the District Bank Bill; passed with an amendment, thrice voted for to get a count of 86 to 36 a precise quorum, within half an hour after 216 members had voted— The bill was passed 108 to 58. after a motion to adjourn, lost by yeas and nays 70 to 79— Dickens Secretary of the Senate announced their concurrence in the amendment to the Bankrupt bill. Adjourned at a quarter past 3— In the evening I went to hear the music of the marine corps band, on a stage in the Southern enclosure at the President’s house. He was on the South Portico and Mr Hawley came from him and invited me there. I went and he introduced to me his three daughters, Mrs Semple, Mrs Jones and Miss Tyler.

Tillinghast presented Resolutions of the Legislature of Rhode-Island— The yeas and nays were taken on printing the accounts for the expenses of the late President Harrison’s funeral— Carried 105 to 75 chiefly by a party vote. Snyder attempted to call up his Resolution for adjourning next Monday, but failed. Graham introduced a Bill to change the location of the Statue of Washington by Greenough; from the centre of the Rotundo prescribed by Law, to a station 30 feet towards the door leading to the library. I made some enquiries which produced a debate, and a final reference of the Bill to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, who have before them another Bill upon the same subject— The change of location, is urged by Greenough himself, for the sake of a favorable light. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, James W. Williams of Churchville Harford County Maryland in the Chair— The amendments of the Senate to the fortification appropriation Bill were taken up and captiously debated. The Committee of Ways and Means, propose an amendment to one of the Senate’s amendmentsmoved an amendment to the amendment proposed by the Committee—this was objected to as an amendment in the third degree; not allowed by the rules— The Chairman decided that it was in order—the rule being confined to proceedings in the house, and not extending to amendments proposed by the house— Proffit made a fractious, scolding speech, complaining of injustice in withholding appropriations from the West, and especially that for fifteen States there was but one member on the Committee of Ways and Means— Howard of Michigan followed in a milder mood— I went into the Senate chamber and heard Henry Clay for about half an hour comment severely on the veto message—till I was summoned back by a call of the house— The Committee had risen for want of a Quorum— The call produced 160 members, and the Chairman of the Committee of the whole resumed the chair—the debate on the amendments from the Senate and the amendments to them proposed by the Committee of Ways and Means, was continued to great tediouness, till Fillmore prevailed on the Committee to report both sets of amendments to the house, which thereupon shortly after 3. adjourned— John Connell was here to solicit a recommendation of him by me to judge Hopkinson, for an appointment as Commissioner of bankrupts. I declined— Dr S. R. Ingalls, brought me a recommendatory Letter from A. H. Everett— Miss Cutts was here— And Miss Freeman from Baltimore. "

Friday  Mr Waters is still a candidate for restoration to the appointment of an appraiser in the custom house at Boston, first bestowed on him by President Monroe, and from which he was removed by President Jackson.— Mr Nichols was here on a similar errand— He wants the Office of Consul at Havre or Hamburg—or Bremen, or Bristol.— At the house they seemed scarcely to know what to do.— The Committees were called for Reports, but none were made— For want of any thing else John G. Floyds M’Leod Resolution was taken up— About the first week in July Morgan had taken the floor on this motion, but it now came up unexpectedly, and he was unprepared— He made a short speech in answer to an old rancorous forgotten one of Bowne, with allusions to Bowne’s federal friend and predecessor Prentiss.— Morgan read Van Buren’s instructions to M’Lane in England, to make merit of the sacrifice of the Navigation interest of the Union, and imputing to the preceding administration an obstinate adherence to, and then an abandonment of the same interest. Bowne replied in a towering passion, acknowledging that Prentiss had been a federalist; but insisting that he had seen the error of his ways, and become a convert to democracy dyed in the wool— He then attempted a feeble panegyric upon himself, and a pompous one upon Prentiss, a worthless and malicious fellow— Morgan asked him if Prentiss had paid the bet of 1000 dollars that he lost last Summer— Bowne’s countenance fell, and he said he knew nothing about that— But it is well known that he did make the bet, and after losing refused to pay it—in justice, he said, to his family. Barnard, moved to postpone the subject till next Tuesday; wishing, he said to occupy about an hour upon it— Maxwell moved to lay the Resolution on the table— Lost by yeas and nays 79 to 111. Cave Johnson moved and withdrew the Previous Question— Ingersoll moved an amendment— Not in order— The subject was postponed— Amendments of the Senate to the fortification Bill, with amendments to them reported from the Committee of ways and means, and from the Committee of the whole, taken up. Two of the Senate’s amendments adopted—two rejected— Message from the Senate, announcing that the President had vetoed the Bank Bill: that the Senate had reconsidered it, and resolved that it should not pass—two thirds not voting for it— The vote was 25 to 24— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Dawson in the Chair— Sergeant moves to take up House bill N. 14: the Bank Bill reported by the currency Committee; and then moves a substitute by the name of a fiscal corporation—read— Committee rose, and the Bill was ordered to be printed— Adjourn’d a quarter after 3.

David Bronson of Anson, Maine had yesterday moved a reconsideration of the vote ordering the accounts of the expenses for the funeral of President Harrison to be printed. This morning he said his reason for moving the reconsideration was that he thought many of the charges outrageously extravagant. But he now understood that the accounts were not settled, but were to be audited and to undergo a suitable revision— He therefore withdrew his motion— Sergeant moved a Resolution, that debate on the new fiscal corporation Bill, should cease in Committee of the whole, at 4 this afternoon and the question then be taken on pending amendments, and the bill be reported to the house— Hubbub. Roosevelt moved an amendment to take the questions instanter— Morgan was for accepting the amendment. On private remonstrances, Sergeant modified his resolution so as to substitute 4. O’Clock p.m. next Monday, instead of this day, to take the bill out of Committee— Cave Johnson asks to be excused from voting on this question, and raves against the house and the rule and the gag— Called to order two or three times, and permitted by yeas and nays, and at last voted down, for contual disorder— Then Charles Brown played the same game for three quarters of an hour, till he was voted down— Rhett of South-Carolina, asking to be excused, with a paper of reasons—and he was voted down— He then demanded that his reasons should be entered on the journal— Refused—being against the rule— Andrew Kennedy of Indiana, made the fourth experiment on the patience and forbearance of the house, till he was voted down, and withdrew his motion to be excused— Full three hours were wasted in this wretched and brutal trifling, till Pickens himself intreated them to push it no further, and to give it up— The question upon the Resolution was then taken and carried— Garrett Davis charged Rhett with having voted for just such a resolution, as that which he now so bitterly vilified, which Rhett denied; but he did vote for the first Resolution of this character moved by Clifford 26. June 1840, to force the passage of the Sub-treasury bill— And now, after all this chicanery the house at the motion of Sergeant went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Dawson in the Chair, on this new Fiscal Corporation Bill— Sergeant, spoke his hour in explaining the bill; and Wise two hours against the Bill, but most especially against Henry Clay, whom he called Rumour— At the end of his first hour, he did not take his Seat but Turney of Tennessee moved to strike out the enacting clause of the Bill, and then giving the floor to Wise, who claimed and exercised it by decision of the chairman against numerous remonstrances— T. F. Marshall took the floor, the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— Miss Freeman dined here. "

At the Presbyterian church this morning, a stranger preached from John 3.16. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.” It is an abuse of this text, to pursue it into inference revolting to the moral sense of the hearer— “Whosoever”—said this young man—mark that word “whosoever[”] however numerous—however atrocious may have been his crimes—let him but believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, he shall not perish, but have everlasting life.— Mr Moore was in the pulpit, and gave notice, that a communication had been received from the pastor of the church, for the consideration of which there would be a meeting of the members of the Society to morrow afternoon at 6 O’Clock, which all were invited to attend— At St. John’s Church this afternoon, Mr Hawley read the evening service for the eleventh Sunday after Trinity, and Mr. Krusay of Philadelphia preached from John 14.2. “In my Father’s house, are many mansions.”— This discourse was not badly written; but contained nothing of any practical utility—commentary upon the import of the words house, and mansions—also upon the word many— The mode of delivery was as cold as the substance of the Sermon— Miss Cutts was here at tea— Evening visits from Mr Saltonstall and Mr Winthrop—and afterwards from Mr Isaac C. Bates, one of the Senators from Massachusetts for a confidential consultation— He shewed me an amendment to the Land-bill so called proposed by Mr Berrien of Georgia, and without which he announces that he will not vote for the bill. The amendment is that if at any time the impost duties should exceed 20 percent ad valorem, the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands shall be suspended, so long as such excess shall continue— The object of which is to force the continuance of what is called the compromise act of Feby 1833— He asked my advice, whether to vote for the bill should this amendment be adopted? I said I certainly should not— But he will— He complained bitterly of the manner in which injustice and indignity are heaped upon New-England—but heard the whole delegation from Massachusetts will submit to any mortification, while Mr Webster shall continue to be secretary of State; and he will remain Secretary of State till he shall be positively removed from the office— There is now every probability that this must soon happen; but the interval will be filled up with humiliating compliances— The first and meanest of these was that which disgraced the late vetoed bank-bill I disdained submission to it, and voted against the bill— But the whig portion of the delegation yielded—even those who had flinched at the revenue bill— Let it not be forgotten— "

Immediately after the reading of the journal, the rectification of the votes of Dean and Proffit, on the journal of yeas and nays, of last Saturday and a peevish complaint of Cave Johnson, that a Call moved by him, for some list of removals had not yet been answered, the House on the motion of John Sergeant went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. W. C. Dawson in the Chair, and took up the fiscal corporation Bill. T. F. Marshall spoke one hour, in avowed reply to Wise’s Speech of Saturday, and pulverized it with solid argument, and impassioned yet chastened eloquence. Wise’s ghastly face, was convulsed with torture under it, and his laugh was the laugh of an excruciated fiend. Marshall’s hour expired in the midst of one of his most beautiful flights of Fancy— Wise was upon the rack. Another hour would have impaled him. Marshall was followed by the dull prosing of Gilmer, ex-governor of Virginia— Governor Reynolds of Illinois had just been sworn in by the Speaker.— Gilmer’s argument against the bill was nothing; but he indulged his resentment against the imputation of forming part of a kitchen cabinet, which Mr Clay had given out covertly, in his speech last week on the veto.— Gilmer has just talent enough to have been sometime Governor of Virginia, and to have resigned his Office upon some misunderstanding between him and the Legislature of the State, relating to his mismanagement of the controversy with the Governor of New-York— Proffit of Indiana came next—having made a complete Somerset over to the democracy— The People of his State have just done the same, by a sweep almost total from whiggery. Proffit follows their lead. He is a self made man; with a grave, stern forbidding face, and a sly, shrewd, caustic humour, which when he speaks never fails to convulse the house with laughter. He is rather low in stature, but well proportioned, with an air of restless anxiety, which contrasts with the pungent drollery of his sarcasms— He is altogether a very pleasant member of the house, but not a trusty one to any thing but his own humour— He made now a bitter speech against the bill, succeeded by a more effective one of W. Cost Johnson in its favour— Then Pope rambled an hour for and against it. Horace Everett, with small power of Speech, but with much influence as a sensible, judicious, moderate and honest man gave the bill half an hour; and Underwood closed the debate— At 4. p.m—the questions began to be taken. Sundry foolish captious amendments were moved and rejected by tellers. The bill finally was screwed through all opposition, but Wise made a speech of half an hour on a motion to reconsider the amended title 125 to 94. The house adjourned about 7. Levi Anderson a file-cutter here this morning. "

                "text": "24. IV. Tuesday—  After the reading of the journal John W. Jones, and George B. Cary, members from Virginia presented Resolutions of popular meetings within their respective districts, protesting against a National Bank, a Bankrupt Law: a Law for the distribution of the proceeds of the public Lands—the Loan Law and to all the restorative measures introduced and in progress during the present Session of Congress. Jones said that as those presented by him had been printed by order of the Senate, he would only ask that they should be laid on the table which was done; but Cary demanded that those which he presented should be read, which they were, and ordered to be printed which they were not— Coles of Virginia presented a memorial from his district against a bankrupt Law— Other members presented memorials by general consent, and I presented five abolition petitions received since theof July the last day upon which I had presented any—3 of these were partly received— Boardman from the Committee on the public buildings and grounds made a report against the petition of the Stone-cutters for employment. R. M. Saunders from the judiciary Committee reported the Senate bill for the distribution of the census returns, with an amendment, which was adopted and the bill was passed— These and other small matters scarcely consumed the morning hour, when the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Horace Everett in the Chair— The bill to make an appropriation of 497657 dollars to pay the debts of the post-office Department was taken up and produced a running fire of four hours, against the Postmaster General chiefly from John G. Floyd and Samuel S. Bowne members from the State of New-York and Cave Johnson of Tennessee, and defences by Chittenden and Morgan, New-Yorkers, and Dawson of Georgia— Reynolds of Illinois who came in yesterday said he should vote against the whole bill, and would not vote a dollar, no, not a cent, to pay the contractors, for they knew when they made the contracts that they must depend upon the funds of the department for payment and every tub should stand upon its own Bottom— He said too that not only the Postmaster General, but the whole Cabinet ought to resign— The President could have no confidence in them— And if they refused to resign, the President ought to give them their walking papers— The sooner the better— Just after 3. on motion for the committee to rise, there was no quorum voting—they rose therefore; the chairman reported the fact, and the house adjourned— Joseph Trumbull told me that the Speaker told him this morning, that he had appointed Caleb Cushing chairman of the Committee of foreign Relations, at the special request of Mr Webster— It was after the Speaker had asked me, if I had any objection to serve on that Committee— There was a man by the name of Woodruff here this eve.

Mr Parmenter presented two petitions; and the Speaker, a Letter from the Mayor of the City, Seaton enclosing a copy of the proceedings of a public meeting of the Citizens to manifest their indignation, at the insult upon the President of the United States by a small and riotous assemblage of worthless persons, in the yard before the President’s house in the night after his veto upon the bank-bill— The communication was referred to the Committee on the District of Columbia, and ordered to be printed. The house went immediately into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Horace Everett in the Chair, upon the Post-Office Appropriation bill— A debate of nearly eight hours, ensued in the continuation of that of yesterday— Cary, Steenrod, Hopkins, Littlefield, all minions in debate began the exercises of the day, with petty objections to the Bill, and with venomous insinuations against the postmaster General— But Gordon came out with an hour speech, bitter as gall declaring that he would not appropriate a dollar to the service of the Post Office, while Granger should be Postmaster general— Arnold of Tennessee broke out in a counterblast of an hour against the miserable wretch at the other end of the Avenue, whom he considered as a Traitor to the whig party and to the cause of the country.— He spoke so loud, and vehement, and impetuously, that his articulation became indistinct, and I could not hear much of what he said— He was call’d to order by Roosevelt and Winthrop: and was decided by the Chairman Everett, to be out of order, for using expressions, disrespectful to the President of the United States. Arnold appealed, and the chairman began to put the question, whether his decision should be affirmed, when I rose and said that if the Committee were to vote on the appeal, as the call to order for words spoken, the rule required that the words should be taken down— They were accordingly taken down, and the decision was so manifestly wrong, that Arnold to save the chairman the mortification of a nearly unanimous reversal, withdrew his appeal, which Ingersoll immediately renewed; but at Arnold’s earnest request also withdrew— Stanly followed in a speech of sharp rebuke to Arnold, Botts and Proffit, who retorted, followed by Dawson who preached peace, where there was no peace, by a swarm of dirty slave-breeders, and the winding stair-case of Caleb Cushing— The debate closed for the day by a regular set to between Tom Marshall of Kentucky, and Wise—each for one hour, amusing enough— But Marshall was too spirited—and Wise’s endless egotism less sprightly than usual— It was little short of 6. O’Clock, when Andrews of Kentucky, moved the Committee to rise, and the house adjourned— The whig party is in the agonies of dissolution, and this day disclosed many symptoms of its approach— We are in the hands of a being—good and wise!

A young man, clerk in a German house at Baltimore himself a German named Berg called on me this morning and gave me a somewhat curious document— A sort of Consular certificate, dated at Konigsberg in the kingdom of Prussia, 22. April 1837. signed Olof Berg Swedish and Norwegian Consul for East Prussia, and sworn translator in the royal high Courts of Konigsberg. It is a recommendatory Letter or Passport for his Son, to which is annexed as a voucher, an original Letter from me to the house of Schwinck and Koch dated at St. Petersburg 18/30 July 1810. recommending to them Mr William Gray’s brig Rover Captain William Groves, which Mr Gray had despatched for Konigsberg, and which was expected to arrive there— Mr Olof Berg says that he was then a chief Clerk in the house of Schwinck and Koch—that they are both since dead. that upon the dissolution of their house in 1824. he became possessed of this Letter, and annexes it to his certificate to serve as a Letter of recommendation to his son 16 1/2 years old, coming to America— He is now in his 21st year, and situated to his satisfaction in the house in Baltimore— He had also and gave me another Letter from Mayer and Bruxner to the same house of Schwinck and Koch dated St. Petersburg 29. Jany 1815. being a Letter of credit for my wife— He enquired what prospect I thought there would be for a younger brother of his to come over in search of employment as an Overseer of a farm; but I could give him no encouragement for this— At the house, before I got there, Briggs moved a resolution to cease debate on the Post-Office appropriation bill, and to take it out of Committee at Noon this day. Linn moved a call of the house, which I entered while the question of the call was taking by yeas and nays it was then carried and when 150 members had answered to their names it was superseded—all postponing amendments to Briggs’s resolution were rejected and the resolution itself carried— Andrews had the floor but yielded it for an explanation to Botts, who accepted the challenge of Caleb Cushing to discuss the conduct of President Tyler relating to the Bank Bill; not now—but when the second Bank veto will come, as come it will— Andrews said little on the bill and Watterson consumed the last forty minutes against it— After engrafting upon the bill an useless amendment it was reported to the house—passed for engrossment and passed— Then the bill for paying the expenses of President Harrison’s funeral; and then the bill for placing Greenough’s Statue of Washington in the Rotunda. Adjourned at 3. p.m.— Rainy evening. "

IV:30 Friday  John Campbell of South Carolina offered a Resolution directing the Clerk of the House, after the close of this Session to have the Seats in the Hall numbered, and the names of the members drawn by lot to assign to each member his seat for one Session— Morgan and Hopkins objected— M’Kay moved to suspend the rules, which the Speaker said by a special rule of this Session was not in order during the morning hour— In the course of the day Campbell repeated the attempt to introduce the Resolution, and Pickens offered as a substitute a direction to the Clerk to have all the desks except the outer circle removed and then the numbers of the Seats drawn for the members in alphabetical order. after much chaffering the Resolution was laid on the table— Campbell told me that he would make an exception for me; but the real cause of all this heart-burning about the Seats was that by the good-will of Rice Garland, he gave me when he left the house at the close of the first Session of the last Congress, the right to his Seat, one of the best, instead of one of the worst which I had occupied during that Session— There was a multiplicity of small business transacted in the house this day. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Augustine H. Shepperd in the Chair— Bill for the suppression of Indian hostilities in Florida; taken up and laid aside, Levy the Delegate from Florida who introduced it not being present— It ought not to pass— Bill making appropriations for purchasing sites for fortifications, making surveys &c— After some discussion concerning a supposed claim of the United States against the State of New-York it was laid aside, and afterwards in the house the Committee of the whole was discharged from the further consideration of it, and it was referred to the Military Committee— The Land Bill was returned from the Senate with many amendments—an attempt was made to take it up for consideration which was only so far successful as to order the printing of the bill as amended— A joint solution for the distribution among the States of 700 copies of the digest of Patents was adopted and an appropriation bill, for the outfits and Salaries of sundry diplomatic agents was much debated and finally passed. Ingersoll moved to strike the outfit, and Salaries out for the missions to Naples and to Sardinia— I opposed this motion, but offered a Resolution instructing the Committee of foreign Relations to enquire into the expediency of reducing the expenditures of the diplomatic department by diminishing the foreign Missions— This was adopted— A Bill passed for repairing the Potomac Bridge—and one for re-paving Pennsylvania Avenue stop’d at the 3d. reading.

Saturday  Yesterday Morning I took to the judge of the Orphans Court at the City Hall the Letter from Michael Leary to me of 18 June last, with the certificates on it that he is the father of the late Jeremy Leary, and the judge entered a minute on the Letter, that upon payment to the father this Letter will be received as a voucher for allowance of the Administrator’s account— The Man Stokes who came here last evening was the same who came to me nine years ago, and for whom I then procured a copy of the Will of John Stokes from Raleigh, North-Carolina— He lately applied to Mr Seth M. Staples of New-York with whom I have had a correspondence at New York upon the subject—but Stokes who says he has been living several years in Charleston South-Carolina, says he has lost the copy of the Will which I procured for him, and he is now wandering about the country seeking for another copy. He did not even remember the place where it was registered till I told him it was Raleigh. Nor did he know that two other members of the family, a man and his wife from London had been here three or four years ago, in the same pursuit as devisees of John Stokes. The case of these claimants really deserves compassion— Mr Stevens and the two other Gentlemen from New-York, who were here last Evening have taken the loan of one Million of Dollars opened by the Secretary of the Treasury at the annual interest of 5 1/2 per cent— At the House this morning, the first thing done was a call of the house, pursued till 170 members answered to their names, and then superseded— The Bill making an appropriation for paving the Pennsylvania avenue with wood was then rejected by yeas and nays 69 to 103. The Bill to amend the act of 12. June 1840. to carry into effect the Convention of 11. April 1839 with Mexico— I believe there is an insidious purpose in this Bill, but it passed, after considerable discussion, and with an amendment proposed by Everett— Soon after Noon the House adjourned, absolutely for want of something to do.— I asked the Speaker what had become of the M’Leod Resolution— He said it was on the table. But there was a laugh in the house, and some one said it was in nubibus— After the adjournment and some casual conversation, I went into the Senate chamber where they were debating amendments to the Revenue bill from the house. Upon a question of exempting Sumach from duty, there was a sparring of a full half an hour, with sharp personalities between Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun about protective duties and free trade— Jane Jesup is here, and Miss Freeman was here at tea— Evening promiscuous party of Whigs of all shades at Mr Crittenden the Attorney Generals— Mrs Crittenden there sola— Side board supper, Madeira and Champagne— I walked home, between 9 and 10.

[“]No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.” There was apparently some allusion to the condition of the Church, in this text; but none except of general cheering and encouragement in the discourse— The preacher gave notice that he should preach there this afternoon—that the communion would be administered there next Sunday morning by Mr Smith pastor of the presbyterian Church in 9th. Street, and that the Presbytery taking into consideration the condition of the Church, now vacant, would, as they had done before on a like occasion supply the pulpit, until the Society shall have the opportunity of providing themselves with a permanent pastor— The communication from Mr Wood therefore, announced from the pulpit last Sunday, and upon which a meeting was called for the evening of the next day, was, and I supposed it to be, a valedictory to the Society— From the scattered and prostrate condition of the church, nothing else could be expected. There were not more than fifty persons present— Most of them women. As I was returning home, passing by the foundery Methodist Church, the congregation were pouring out by hundreds—it seemed almost as if by thousands: Men, women, children, with not one of whom I was personally acquainted, but all decently, neatly and not a few of them tastefully clad— The crowded Churches in this city are all methodists or Roman Catholics.— After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Krusay or Courcy (from Mr Hawley’s pronunciation of his name I could not tell which,[)] read the evening prayer for the 12th. Sunday after Trinity and preached from 1. Corinthians 15.29. “Else, what shall they do, which are baptized for the dead? if the dead rise not at-all. Why are they then baptized for the dead?” This text is hard to be understood, and the commentary of the preacher did not clear it to my mind from its obscurity— I know not what is meant by being baptized for the dead— There is no such rite in any Christian church now, but I suppose the allusion must be to some practice of the primitive Christians, when Paul wrote this Epistle— The whole Chapter is at once argumentative, sublime, and awfully mysterious— After Church I called at Mr T. B. Johnson’s but he had not returned from his ride— I visited Mr Charles J. Ingersoll at his lodgings.— Mrs Thornton and Mrs. Talbot spent the evening with us and Major Hoops a tottering more than octogenarian relic of the army of our Revolution, gave me also a transient call— I received from my wife a Letter dated last Thursday, with most painful intelligence concerning the health of my Son’s wife, since her confinement— She is at Medford.

Monday  John Maul was here this morning to invoke my assistance to obtain for him some place, from the Secretary of War— Any place he said would suit him— I told him I had spoken in his favour to Mr Bell, and would speak to him again. On looking over yesterday the printed journal of the house for the present Session, I found to my utter astonishment, that my name was recorded among the yeas, upon the adoption of the rule, reported by the Committee on the rules, excluding petitions, during the present Session—the question was taken on the 12th. of June, and this falsification of my vote is on page 120. of the journal— I went to the Capitol this morning at 9 to clear the matter up— I found that the error was in the manuscript Journal and on the list of yeas and nays taken upon the question— But French who keeps the minutes of the Journal remembered that I had voted against the Resolution, and the Journal itself shewed that I had voted ay upon a preceding motion to lay the reported rule on the table, and on a subsequent motion to reconsider the adoption of the rule— There were two other errors on the printed journal of the same vote, setting down the yeas as 106 while the names including mine are but 105. and the nays 60. while the names without mine were 61— Birch told me that the sheet of the journal should be printed over again, and the mistakes rectified— Robert C Winthrop told me in the house that after I came away from Mr Crittenden’s Saturday evening, a regular deputation was sent over to the President’s house, to constrain him to join the party; to which he had been invited, but had sent an excuse— On this deputation were Dawson and Triplett—they went over—roused him, if not from bed, after the house had been closed for the Night; obtained access to him; took him by storm after the Kentucky fashion; led him over to Crittenden’s, in triumph, where Clay received him at the door, with—Well Mr President, what are you for—Kentucky Whiskey, or Champagne.— He chose Champagne, and entered into the Spirit of this frolicsome agony, as if it was congenial to his own temper. But all this was as false and hollow as it was blustering and rowdyish.— At the house I attempted to call up the M’Leod Resolution, But Barnard who had the floor upon it, was at first not there, and when afterwards he came in the morning hour was out.— I called up my resolutions offered on the 23d of June, concerning investments in State Stocks; but the Speaker said it was petition day— He therefore called the States over for Petitions, but there were none to present— The amendments of the Senate to the Land-proceeds distribution bill were reported back by Morrow from the Committee on the public Lands and John C. Clark instantly moved the previous Question— Most of them were adopted— The amendments to the fortification bill succeed— The house adjourned without closing that debate at half past 3. Mr Minott Thayer of Braintree was here this Evening. "

Kingsbury, Postmaster at Weymouth, which I received a few days since, relating to this same complaint about the reduction of the mails—and I left with Mr Ewing, papers received from Mr Henry Lunt in support of his claim to a portion of the prize-money deposited in the Treasury from the prizes taken by the Bonhomme Richard and Alliance in 1779.— I afterwards introduced Mr Thayer on the floor of the House of Representatives.— Mr Joseph T. Adams also called on me to request me, to add my signature to those of almost the whole delegation from Massachusetts, in both houses, recommending him for an appointment to office. He wishes some place of Chargé d’Affaires, or some profitable consulate. I declined signing the paper, upon the general rule that I have prescribed to myself. At the house, the Journal reported Hopkins’s moral lecture against the practice of pairing off; on which he called the yeas and nays, which refused to excuse Botts and John W. Jones, for absence because they had paired off. Goggin objected to that part of the journal, and the Speaker said it should be rectified. Linn Banks presented Resolutions of a meeting of Slave-breeders in Orange County, Virginia, against all the measures of this Session and made a Speech upon them through long continued vociferous calls to order. His seat is contested— His Resolutions were laid on the table, but not ordered to be printed— Everett threatened to read a speech on the subject at some future day— Mr Barnard made an excellent hour speech on Floyd’s M’Leod Resolution— The Senate’s amendments to the fortification bill then produced a long debate after which Fillmore moved to change the daily hour of adjournment to 12 O’Clock—the house having nothing to do. Stanly moved to adjourn over to Thursday. Then a hubbub, and adjournment about 2. p.m— I went into the Senate chamber and heard the debate there. Coll. Todd, Miss Cutts and Captain Buchanan were here this Evening. "

He said Mr Argaiz had intimated that he should consider this note as closing the discussion— At the house Zadok Casey took his seat as the third member from Illinois. I prevailed finally upon the house to adopt my 4th. Resolution offered on the 23d. of June instructing the Committee of Ways and Means, to report a Bill prohibiting the further investment of public funds in State Stocks. W. O. Butler of Kentucky made an hour speech against Webster on the M’Leod Resolution— Precisely at Noon the house adjourned, after refusing by yeas and nays to adjourn half an hour before, and concurring in an amendment of the Senate to the Post-Office appropriation Bill— The adjournment was for a whig caucus instead of which I went into the Senate chamber, and heard them debate the fiscal corporation bill— I left Benton prosing Anti-bankism— Evening visit from a Choctaw chief named Nail with two other.

Nail, the Choctaw chief, came last evening with his two companions to request my assistance in getting through the house, a bill from the Senate, to indemnify him and his tribe for lands of which they have been shamefully deprived; and I promised him whatever aid might be in my power.—This morning Mr Stokely, a member of the House from the State of Ohio came with a young man named Schaeffer a German Pennsylvanian—a friar mendicant for the establishment of some common school for the Germans in Western Pennsylvania— The Pennsylvania Germans are among the most thriving portions of the population of this Union, and ought not to resort to beggary to maintain their common schools. Mr Schaeffer presented me a subscription paper with the name of President Tyler down for 50 dollars, and D. Webster and J. Bell each for 20. I declined subscribing. Mr Homer came much distressed for a loan of 20 dollars to pay for his board— He said he had written to Boston for money which he should receive in a very few days, and would then faithfully repay me— I have heard such before; but I lent him the money; took his promissory note payable on demand, and entered the sum in my book of household expenses— At the house, August C Dodge, delegate from the territory of Ioway took his seat, and Halsted Chairman of the Committee of Elections, reported that David Levy is not a citizen of the United States, and therefore not entitled to a Seat as Delegate from the Territory of Florida. The Speaker read a Letter from Shields of Alabama, stating that he was necessarily called away, and asking that another member may be appointed in his place on the Committee of Elections—ordered accordingly— Gentry obtained leave of absence for Christopher H. Williams for the rest of the Session. M’Kay offered a Call on the Secretary of War for a Report to the next Session of Congress which was received and adopted; whereupon I called up the Resolution offered by me on the 23d. of July calling on the Secretary of the Treasury for a report at the next Session concerning the debts of the States, which was also adopted without opposition. M’Kay then obtained the adoption of six joint-resolutions, requiring an investigation by the Attorney General of the title of the United States, to the sites of Fortifications &c— Committees called for Reports. Fillmore, from the Ways and Means reported a Bill to repeal the 6th. Section of the West Point Appropriation Bill of 1838. 7. July and to prohibit the further investment of public funds in Stocks of the States—it passed through its three readings without opposition. Much other business transacted rapidly and the house adjourned— Senate chamber. Spirited and ludicrous debate on the fiscal corporation Bill— Rives’s appeal, and apology to me. Home at 6. O’Clock to dine— Evening party at Mr Bell’s. President Tyler there— I came home soon after 10. Music. Dancing— Heat. "

Friday  Mr Hawley paid us a visit last evening; attracted by observing the notice of the liberation of the Smithsonian fund from the shackles of the West-Point appropriation act of 1838. He has a sharklike appetite for crumbs from the Smithsonian table for some charitable institution, and also for himself— This morning Mr Thayer called, and asked for an introductory Letter to George E. Badger, Secretary of the Navy which I gave him— He was to have started this morning for home, but he received a Letter from a Mr Hart at the Navy-yard, Philadelphia, requesting him to see and remonstrate with the Secretary of the Navy, concerning certain removals and appointments, which delays his appointment for another day— Mr Moody called here also this morning. At the House a joint Resolution granting the franking privilege to the widow of the late President Harrison was taken up— I moved to strike out the limitation of two ounces or under, which was done— At Cushing’s motion it was changed from a Resolution to a Bill— Lot Warren objected to it as excluded by the rule restricting the action of the house during the present Session; but that rule is confined to the action of Committees— The bill was passed— J. G. Floyd finished his replication Speech on his M’Leod Resolution, and was followed by Horace Everett with a short outline speech— Boardman moved to lay the Resolution on the table, whereupon Floyd called for the yeas and nays and at half past 11. the house adjourned, after an abortive attempt to adjourn over to Monday. Coll. Hayne of S.C. came to my seat to request a conversation with me at some convenient time, about a plan which he has formed for settling by a compromise the great Slavery question, and he wishes me to undertake— His views are pure and benevolent; I promised cheerfully to see and hear him on the subject without fixing the time— In the Senate my Bill to prohibit further investments of U.S. public funds in Stocks of the States was no sooner read than Woodbury and Sevier the contractors of the bargain consummated by the 6th. Section of the West-Point appropriation act of 1838 immediately started up, and one of them moved to lay it on the table— It was however referred to the Committee of finance, of which Henry Clay is chairman, and I commended the Bill to his care.— He referred me to George Evans a member of the same Committee who said would have charge of the Bill— The Senate this day passed the fiscal corporation bill 27 to 22. with a certainty that it will be vetoed by President Tyler— I was dallying in conversation with several members in the house, when the vote was taken— I went in soon afterwards and found them engaged upon the fortification bill—but immediately after they went into Executive business and I came home. Mr Colahan and Mr White are young men from Philadelphia Mr Connell and Dr Thomas passed most of the Evening with me. "

Saturday—  I called this morning at the Treasury Department The Secretary was not there, but I gave to Mr. M’Clintock Young the Chief Clerk, the affidavit of Mr Henry Lunt, in support of his claim for certain prize money, which I had received from him—and I gave the Treasurer Selden, my receipt for a draft of 1500 dollars, on the Receiver General at Boston, which I have remitted to Schuyler Sampson, at Plymouth. At the House, Boardman had moved yesterday to lay the M’Leod Resolution on the Table, and the yeas and nays had been called— I had been urged by several members to speak on this question, and had hesitated whether I would or not, down till I entered the house this morning— In my hesitation I had made no preparation to speak, and had not one line, noting the topics to be touched upon. I finally asked Boardman if he would withdraw his motion to lay the Resolution the table— O yes, if I would renew it— I said I could not do that, if any one should wish to reply to me— Well he withdrew his motion without condition— I then rambled through a Speech with out method or compass till the Speaker’s hammer came down announcing that my hour was out—several motions were made for permission to me to proceed, but I declined— I scarcely know what I said; but Wheeler the Reporter told me he had ample notes, and would send them to me— He told me too that his nubibus hic tumidus, fluctibus ille minax was from an ode of Horace— When I finished, or rather when my speech was amputated Wise rose and said he wished as a Virginian to defend Stevenson, whom I had lashed, and I intreated that he might have liberty to proceed; but he had spoken his hour on the question before the house; and they refused to hear him now— Boardman renewed his motion to lay the resolution on the table and it was carried by yeas and naysto— Wise then asked leave to offered a Resolution calling on the President for copies of Stevenson’s dastardly Letter to Commodore Hull—he was told that it had been communicated to the Senate, and was published in their documents— The majority was for suspending the rules, but not two thirds— Wise will hang his defence of Stevenson upon some other question, when I shall not be allowed, or not prepared to reply to him.— The house adjourned before 12. David Levy the Delegate from Florida, against whom the Committee of elections have reported, as not a citizen of the United States, came to my Seat to crave my assistance in his favour—but his case, though hard, is desperate— I went into the Senate, where they were debating the revenue bill—at 3.

Mr Gould, whom Mr Henry brought with him and introduced to me last Evening has invented a plan of a commonplace book, an improvement upon Locke’s, and which he wishes to introduce into common schools, as a part of the education of children. Short hand writing is a part of his system, and he read me parts of a dissertation upon his project for which he wanted a recommendatory notice from me. I declined giving it on the general rule that I have prescribed to myself; but said I believed it would be very useful, if a practicable system of such a manual could be simplified to the intellect and industry of common minds, which I doubted— I had occupied and amused a long life in the search of such a compendious wisdom-box, but without being able to find or make it— I had made myself more than one of Locke’s commonplace books; but never used any one of them. I had learnt and practised Byrom’s short hand writing; but no one could read it but myself— I had kept accounts by double entry—day-book, Journal and Ledger—with cash-book bank book, house-book, and Letter book— I had made extracts, copies, translations, and quotations more perhaps than any other man living, without ever being able to pack up my knowledge or my labours in any methodical order, and now doubt whether I might not have employed my time more profitably in some one great well compacted comprehensive pursuit, adapting every hour of labour to the attainment of one great end— This morning Mary, and Miss Cutts went with me to the Capitol, and heard the Chaplain of the house, Mr French, read part of the episcopal service for the 13th. Sunday after Trinity, and preach from Proverbs 14.34. “Righteousness exalteth a Nation.” he left out the other part of the verse—“but sin, is a reproach to any people”— It was a valedictory discourse addressed to the members of Congress, not ten of whom were present Nor were one half the seats of the members of the house occupied. Mr French and Mr Tustin the two present chaplains of the two houses, are sensible, intelligent, pious, amiable men; and talented but not attractive preachers. Mr French’s discourse was benevolent, affectionate, and solemn exhortation dealing with due discretion, all in generalities— After dinner, at St. John’s Church Mr Hawley read the service for the 13th. Sunday after Trinity, and a stranger preached from 1. Corinthians 15.53. “For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality.”— A discourse upon death— Always a grave subject— At my time of life, especially solemn as admonition to be prepared for it— The argument of immortality was presented 1. as possible, from instinct 2 probable—from analogy 3. certain, from Revelation and well argued But with a gloomy picture of death— Evening visit from Charles J. Ingersoll. "

Morning visit from Mr Waters, returned from his excursion into Virginia; and waiting for the result of his application to be restored as an Appraiser, at the custom-house in Boston— There are numerous nominations, pending before the Senate; made at the commencement of, or very early in the Session, and upon which the action of the Senate has been and is yet suspended—among them is that of Edward Everett, upon the charge of his being an abolitionist. This morning at the house John W. Jones, presented Resolutions of a democratic meeting in the County of Amelia Virginia, against all the measures of the present Session of Congress.— laid on the table. Taliaferro moved a resolution, that William Smith who contests the election of Linn Banks, be allowed pay as a member during the present Session, because the Committee of Elections, have at the request of Mr Banks allowed him time till the next Session to take testimony to prove his election— Motion not received. George W. Summers Chairman of the select Committee on the contingent expenses of the house, asked leave for the Committee to report at the next Session, and stated some of the expenses of printing and stationery as very exorbitant—the Resolution was adopted— The report of the Committee of elections against David Levy, returned as Delegate from the Territory of Florida, then came up— Halsted enquired of Levy whether he desired to be heard by Counsel— Levy then asked a postponement of the question till the next Session, that he may have the means of proving by testimony that his father was entitled to the rights of a Citizen of the United States, on the transfer of the territory of Florida from Spain to the United States—he supported his demand in a speech of more than an hour, and Halsted, Stanly, Gamble and Wise took part in the debate till half past one, when Pope moved to adjourn, and it was carried— A man named Taylor came to my seat and invited me to go at 5 this afternoon and witness some experiments of submarine explosion at the Navy-yard— The reporter sent me his notes of my speech of Saturday upon the M’Leod Resolution, so wretchedly put together that it will take me almost as much time to write them out, as if I had no notes at all— Immediately after dinner I rode down to the Navy-yard, and witnessed some of the submarine experiments— Mr Taylor had just returned from an excursion of about ten minutes, at the bottom of the river, say, about 20 feet deep, and I saw him uncase himself in his cumbrous armour, something like that of a Roman Soldier or a feudal knight— The next experiment was the successive explosion of three barrels, to shew the different operation of the upward downward and lateral impetus— Then the destruction of a small scow in the stream, by a torpedo under her bottom; and lastly the firing of three explosive swivel balls at a target—but they did not explode— After a short visit to Captain Beverly Kennon, I came home, and found Dr. and Mrs Miller here.

I have been not a little perplexed in coming to a conclusion upon the case of David Levy, the Delegate from Florida—on his contested election— There is no competitor—the objection is that he is not a citizen of the United States— I fear he will not be able to prove that he is; but it is perhaps equally hard to prove that to be a citizen of the United States is a qualification indispensable for a delegate from the Territory of Florida. The question was taken this morning upon his application for time till the Winter Session, and it was carried 123 to 44. the members of the house yet present being reduced nearly to 170.— Harris of Virginia, together with W. A. Goode, presented anti-session democratic resolutions from Clarke County in that State—laid on the table—he complained that the house would neither hear, read, nor print them. Owsley of Kentucky offered two resolutions of amendment to the Constitution—one to restrict the Presidential office to one term of service— The other to make a majority of the whole number of members of both houses, paramount to a veto— Hopkins objects, and the resolutions are not received.— William Russell, a plain, sensible, Ohio farmer, who sits at my right hand presented Resolutions of a whig convention of delegates in that State—laid on the table— He told me he was in a state of extreme agitation, at hearing the sound of his own voice in that Hall. W. B. Calhoun offered a Resolution of Instruction to the Committee on the public buildings to enquire about ventilation— Taliaferro offered again the Resolution, he had attempted to introduce yesterday, to allow pay as a member to William Smith who contests the election of Linn Banks, because the Committee of Elections at the request of Banks had allowed him time till the next Session to take further testimony—the balance of the evidence being at this time against him, and in favour of Smith.— The Resolution was now received; but the Committee had made no report, and they had not the power to allow Banks time till the next Session to take testimony, without the sanction of the house— I objected to the Resolution as not in order, but the Speaker said it had been received by general consent and the objection was now too late— Banks made a passionate speech which nobody heard or heeded— Fillmore move to lay the Resolution on the table— Carried— Ferris reported from the Committee of foreign relations a resolution requesting the President to consider the propriety of entering into negotiations with the British Government, to procure the release of the citizens of the United States, transported to Van Diemen’s Land for participation in the Canadian Insurrection— This Resolution was sliding down without a dissenting voice when I stop’d the Speaker as he was putting the question, and remonstrated against it. Holmes of South-Carolina, as usual replied to me— Stanly moved to adjourn—carried— I went into the Senate chamber where they were passing the revenue-bill 33 to 11. Evening visit from Mr Waters and Mr Brown— Rest of the Evening, with Mrs J. Adams and her daughter Mary-Louisa at Dr Miller’s. "

My poem on the wants of Man is published in the National Intelligencer this morning, from the Albany Evening Journal, from a copy taken by Christopher Morgan, and sent to Mrs Seward, wife of the Governor of New-York.— I have given copies of it in my own handwriting to John P. Kennedy of Baltimore—to Mrs Dawson, wife of William C Dawson of Greensborough Georgia and to Mrs Hunt, wife of Hiram P. Hunt of Troy— New-York. I have promised copies to George W. Summers of Kenhawa C. H. Virginia and to Garrett Davis of Paris Kentucky— Alexander Randall of Annapolis Maryland, John Greig of Canandaigua of New-York, and William H. Washington of Newbern, North-Carolina, have with my permission taken copies of it themselves; and I consented at Morgan’s request to its being published— Ferris’s Van Diemen’s land Resolution, was called up by Horace Everett, immediately after the reading of the Journal, as the unfinished business of yesterday. Everett made a short Speech, and said he had assented in the Committee of foreign relations to report this resolution, under an impression that it was offered in a conciliatory spirit, and with the hope that it might have that tendency— But after Ferris’s Speech in support of the Resolution yesterday, his opinion concerning it was entirely changed, and he moved to lay the Resolution on the table— Ferris immediately intreated him to withdraw the motion, to give him an opportunity to explain; which Everett did, on condition, that he would renew the motion to lay the resolution on the table which Ferris promised to do. His explanation was a mere hollow-hearted denial of all intention to inflame the irritation between the two countries; and an assurance that his intention was altogether conciliatory— Fernando Wood of New-York urgently begged Everett to withdraw the motion to lay on the table, and allow him to speak— Everett declined; the question to lay on the table was rejected by yeas and nays 80 to 81. almost every member from the State of New-York, whig or democrat voting against laying on the table— Wood then made an incendiary speech, and John M’Keon another in the midst of which the morning hour expired and Fillmore moved the orders of the day.— An amendment of the Senate to the diplomatic appropriation bill was referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—so were their amendments to the revenue bill, and these were immediately taken up, Barker Burnell in the Chair— One of the Senate’s amendments was to strike out from the dutiable articles Tea and Coffee Wise moved to add Salt—lost in Committee of the whole, but carried in the house by yeas and nays 94 to 88.— Then moved by Stanly sugar 105 to 75 and Cotton 105 to 78— House in a snarl and adjourned— Towards Sunset, I went with Mrs Thornton and Mrs Talbot, with her Son Theodore, and her daughter Mary, Mrs John Adams and her daughter Mary Louisa and Mr King the painter to the President’s house grounds to hear the music no music, but much company.— The Ladies and Mr King spent the Evening here.

H.R.U.S— Fillmore moved a call of the House— But Hopkins for the same purpose moved to adjourn and asked the yeas and nays to give the members time to come in— The vote was 150 nays including that of Hopkins himself— The unfinished business was the motions for reconsideration of the votes of yesterday, exempting from duty Salt, Sugar and cotton— All reconsidered by yeas and nays. Salt 95 to 79. Sugar 101 to 80. Cotton 119. to 60.— Wise then withdrew his motion to amend the Senate’s amendment by exempting salt, and Stanly withdrew his motion to exempt sugar and cotton. The amendment of the Senate exempting tea and coffee was concurred in 178 to 7. of which my vote was one— There was an amendment of the Senate excluding all duties over 20 per cent ad valorem, to which Fillmore moved an amendment which was carried— The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Samson Mason in the chair, on the amendments of the Senate to the Diplomatic appropriation bill—there was one striking out the item for a chargé d’Affaires at Naples; disagreed to after a long debate in the midst of which Robert Tyler came in, and the Speaker took the chair. R. Tyler then announced that the President had signed three Bills, and then, a message in writing— It was the veto—to the fiscal corporation Bill, which was immediately read— Jeremiah Morrow of Ohio then rose and moved that the message be entered on the Journal of the house—printed for the use of the members of the house, and that to morrow, at 12 O’Clock be appointed, to reconsider the Bill, which was adopted unanimously; Mason then resumed the chair of the Committee of the whole, and M’Keon finished a speech which he had before begun in favour of agreeing with the amendment of the Senate, which struck out the appropriation for the mission to Naples. Cushing Steenrod, Wise took part in the debate— I urged the house to disagree to the Senate’s amendment— Ingersoll followed and Stanly made some cutting remarks upon Wise— Fillmore followed, but had said only a few words, when Wise crossed from his seat to that of Stanly, began by hectoring and finished by insulting him, whereupon Stanly called him a Liar.— Wise struck or attempted to strike him, and a fight ensued; a rush of members to spot, whether to separate the combatants or to take sides with them, it was difficult to say— The Speaker took the Chair and roared Order—Order—but no order came— Many cried out the Sergeant at Arms! the Sergeant at Arms! but no Sergeant at arms appeared— After about 5. minutes of Chaos, Wise appeared in his seat— Addressed the Speaker—said he was perfectly cool, and most humbly begged pardon of the house; and told how he had gone over to remonstrate with Stanly—that words had ensued, till Stanly had applied to him a word which he could not brook and he had struck him— Stanly said he had no pardon to ask of the house— That he had told wise he was a Liar, and would have chastised him severely, if other members had not interfered— Ingersoll offered a Resolution to investigate the rencontre—a Committee of 7. adopted— Adjourned about 4.

H.R.U.S. on the reading of the Journal this morning the names of the 7 members of the Committee to investigate the rencontre between Wise and Stanly as Charles J— Ingersoll calls it, were announced by the Clerk— Ingersoll, Morrow, Everett, Caruthers, Saltonstall, Holmes and Ferris.— Everett asked to be excused, because he had expressed an opinion on the transaction, yesterday, but the house refused to excuse him— After the hubbub was over yesterday I moved the house to Committee of the whole on the State of the Union to take up the amendments of the Senate to the Diplomatic Appropriation Bill—done— Pope in the chair— I took part in the debate, to disagree to the amendment striking out the Neapolitan Mission, and to agree to the amendment making an extra-allowance of 3 Months pay for this Session to the Officers of the two houses, succeeded in both— Then the Committee took up the amendments of the Senate to the Smithson fund bill, with which the house at my motion agreed, and so the bill has gone through both houses. Walter Hellen was here last evening, and Mr Kavasales, who told me that Mr Badger, the Secretary of the Navy had promised to recommend him for a chaplaincy in the Navy. This morning, there was much business done before noon. W. C Dawson announced with great satisfaction, that the sudden and transient difference between Mr Wise and Mr Stanly had been entirely adjusted by the intervention of their common friends, to their mutual satisfaction, and that the former friendly relations between them are restored.— At Noon Botts called up the Veto message; and the reconsideration of the fiscal corporation bill, and he pronounced a severe philippic of one hour upon President John Tyler; whom he accused of Treachery and Perfidy to the whig party. He was answered in another hour speech by Thomas W. Gilmer, who was not less personally severe upon Botts; who resented it more in temper than in words. He referred to a bet of 10000 dollars upon the last Presidential election—which Botts avowed that he had made—and Gilmer used the term jockey with indirect reference to some horse-trading of Botts not generally known to the house but felt by him—some time after Alexander H. H. Stuart announced that this difficulty had been adjusted by the intervention of mutual friends, and read a written statement to that effect— The debate on the bill was continued by Proffit and Lane of Indiana, Mason of Ohio, Isaac D. Jones of Princess Anne, Maryland, Richard W. Thompson of Indiana, till half past 6. when Gamble of Georgia moved the previous question, which was carried, and the vote on the bill by yeas and nays was 103 to 80— Not two thirds— Bill lost— The last amendments on the revenue bill, and the Smithson fund bill were passed and the House adjourned— Meeting at Mr Webster’s of the Massachusetts-delegation— Bates and Choate— Senators, Adams, Baker, Borden, Burnell, Cushing, Hudson, Saltonstall, Winthrop— Absent, Briggs, Calhoun, Hastings, Parmenter— More to-morrow— Home at 11. p.m—impransus.

                "text": "11. V:30. Saturday.  The meeting at Mr Webster’s last evening was at his request— He stated that the Secretary of the Treasury Thomas Ewing, the Secretary of the Navy, George E. Badger of North-Carolina and the Attorney General John J. Crittenden of Kentucky had called on him this day and informed him that they, and John Bell of Tennessee, had determined to send in their resignations of their respective Offices (the latter of Secretary of War) to President Tyler at 11. O’Clock to-morrow Morning.— Mr Webster then addressing me, said, that being thus placed in a peculiar position, and seeing no sufficient cause for resigning his office he had requested this meeting to consult with the members of the delegation, and to have the benefit of their opinions, assuring them that as to the Office itself it was a matter of the most perfect indifference to him whether he retained or resigned it—a declaration which it is possible he believed when he made it— But he had prefaced it by stating that he saw no cause sufficient to justify his resignation. It was like Falstaff’s recruit Bullcalf. “In very truth, sir, I had as lief be hang’d sir, as go; and yet, for mine own part, sir, I do not care: but, rather, because I am unwilling, and for mine own part have a desire to stay with my friends: else, sir, I did not care, for mine own part, so much.” I asked him what reasons his colleagues had assigned for their determination to resign—he said they were various— The Secretary of the Treasury Ewing thought he had been disrespectfully treated by Mr Tyler—and further that Mr Tyler claimed some authority concerning the management of the Treasury which Ewing thought contrary to Law. Mr Crittenden had personal relations with Mr Clay which rendered his position now as a confidential member of Mr Tyler’s administration specially irksome, and to which he thought he could no longer submit. Mr Bell and Mr Badger were sensitive to some part of the Deportment of the President to them which they thought manifested a want of confidence in them— At least Mr Badger, for Mr Bell was not with the others when they came to him this day, and he had not stated what his reason for resigning was— For himself Mr Webster said Mr Tyler had never treated him with disrespect, and he had no doubt it was his desire that he should remain in the Department of State. He gave a very brief narrative of the progress of the two bank-bills and intimated his own belief that Mr Tyler would have signed the second bill, but for the publication of Botts’s Letter to the Richmond Coffee house— Inquiry was made how that most intimate confidential intercourse between the President and the correspondent of the New-York Herald was to be considered coupled—with the continual ferocious and scurrilous abuse in that paper upon all the members of the Cabinet, including Mr Webster himself.— He said Mr Tyler had two indiscreet Sons, and he believed that the exceptionable intercourse has been established and carried on through them—but the joint resignation of the four heads of Departments together was a Clay movement to make up an issue before the people against Mr Tyler. We all agreed that Mr Webster would not be justified in resigning at this time, but we all felt that the hour for the requiem of the whig party was at hand.  Mr Webster told us last evening, that the Postmaster General Francis Granger, desired and intended to remain in office; but he resigned this morning to-gether with the four other heads of Departments, leaving Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, the sole remnant of the Harrison administration, alone in his glory.— At the House this morning, a message was received from the Senate, announcing that they had agreed to the Resolution of the house to adjourn, on Monday next, striking out the words at 11. O’Clock A.M—with which the house immediately concurred— Charles J. Ingersoll presented a report from the Committee appointed to investigate, the attack and assault by Wise upon Stanly in his seat, which Ingersoll’s resolution called a rencontre— The report commenced with a written statement of the facts by each of the two parties, not materially differing from each other— Then the report concludes with several Resolutions— 1. That the whole report and the two statements of facts should be spread upon the Journal of the house, as a reprimand—and then other resolutions that hereafter if any member shall strike another, he shall be expelled and if any one shall insult another he shall be fined 100 dollars And upon this report Wise Ingersoll moved the previous question— I asked him to withdraw it, and he refused— I then moved to lay the report on the table, but withdrew it on a promise from several members that the previous question should be voted down— I rose and enquired to whom this reprimand to be recorded on the Journal was meant to apply— Ingersoll answered by a sneaking, insidious, inflammatory, equivocating Speech, without naming either of the parties, finally said that every one might apply it as he pleased— Stanly enquired of him whether the report was intended to apply the term reprimand to him; and he said he could not tell— He said the Committee were all elderly men and had agreed unanimously to the report, but three of them, Everett, Saltonstall and Caruthers, disowned it, and Caruthers said he had moved or intended to moe, and he did actually move in the house to add to the word reprimand the words to Henry A. Wise— Warren moved as a substitute a resolution to expel Wise, who with a forlorn and crafty affectation of humility said he hoped the house would not pass any vote of censure upon Stanly, and that for himself he would submit to any judgment the house would pass upon him; for there was but one man in the house, whose judgment he was unwilling to abide by, and that was me— He thought by this insult to provoke me to an intemperate retort which would divert the attention of the house from himself to me— I retorted only by disclaiming all personal hostility to him, and by opposing any vote of censure upon him.— Alexander H. H. Stuart at last moved the recommitment of the report, with instructions to report a Resolution that as Wise had apologised to the house, and settled with Stanly, the house would take no further order on the subject, which was adopted by yeas and naystoAdjourned about 3. p.m. "

As I was going to church this morning, I met Miss Cutts who put into my hands a note which she had received requesting her, if she could by any female diplomacy, obtain from me this day before night a copy of my verses addressed to the two Misses Bruce written at the request of Mr William Cost Johnson and given by me to him, with my permission to have them published if he pleased in the Southern Literary Messenger, a Quarterly periodical, published at Richmond Virginia— I found that the Note was from John Howard Payne, a poetical, dramatic and political adventurer, now here, an applicant for an appointment as Secretary of Legation, to any of our foreign missions—a most familiar and intimate acquaintance of President Tylers two Sons John and Robert, and a confidential correspondent of James Gordon Bennett’s New-York Herald, a paper in which the most secret proceedings of the President and his cabinet have for the last six weeks been divulged, with the most fulsome adulation to President Tyler, and the most unbounded and scurrilous abuse upon every member of the Cabinet— This paper has at the same time had almost daily notices of me; sometimes minatorial, but for the last ten days nauseously flattering.— Some three weeks since, the Herald’s correspondent having heard of my verses to the Misses Bruce, promised Bennett a copy of them for publication the next week—and the next week said that he could not furnish them yet; but he should have them— Mr Payne’s note says that Mr Cost Johnson had promised him a copy of the verses, but afterwards said that he had lost it— Miss Cutts came this afternoon for an answer to Mr Payne’s request. I told her that I would with much pleasure comply with it, but that I had given the verses to Mr Johnson with permission to dispose of them at his pleasure, and did not feel myself at liberty to give another copy without his permission.— I have no doubt that Payne wanted the copy to send to Bennett, so that the Herald might get the start of the Southern Literary Messenger in the publication.— At the presbyterian church this morning a Mr M’Lane preached from John 3.3. “Jesus answered and said unto him, verily, verily, I say unto thee— Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Quintessence of Calvinism.— In the afternoon, at St. John’s Church, at 4 O’Clock, Mr Hawley read prayers for the 14th. Sunday after Trinity, and Mr Krusay, preached from 1. Peter 4.17. [“]For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?” On the 30th of May last, being Whitsunday, the day after I arrived here to attend the present Session of Congress, and the day before the Session commenced, I heard at the same St. John’s Church, a sermon from this same text by Mr Armstrong of Wheeling. what a strange co-incidence of time, place, circumstance and them as this double warning that the time is come, that judgment must begin at the house of God.

Marshall of Kentucky rose and enquired of the Speaker, if it would be in order for him to make a motion, on any subject whatever— The Speaker said it would— He moved that 5000 copies of the veto message be printed, and then made a speech of nearly an hour and a half in his own peculiar style of eloquence, sublimated by no thin potations.— Bitter invective upon John Tyler— Extravagant commendatory vituperation upon Wise, lofty sentiment, comprehensive views, and alcohol evaporating in elegant language constituted this speech, at the close of which he withdrew his motion— Everett from the joint Committee soon after came in and reported, and about eight O’Clock the Speaker adjourned the house without day.

                "text": "14. IV:30. Tuesday  General Parker called upon me this morning, with Zealous B. Tower and Horatio G. Wright, two young men recently graduated at the military Academy at West-point, and now, attached to the board of Engineers here at the seat of Government. Tower is the son of Nichols Tower of Cohasset in my 12th. Congressional District of Massachusetts, and was by my nomination admitted as a Cadet at the Academy. He has stood on the annual roll at the head of his class through the four years of his academical term, and Wright stands next to him, with the advantage of standing first on the line of conduct—upon which Tower stands low.— N. 56. with 21 of demerit— A man by the name of Francis Sommerauer a native of Germany came to beg, having been a soldier in the army, discharged for disability of rhumatism, but debarr’d from a pension because the surgeon’s certificate does not attest that the rhumatism was caused by the service— Morning call from judge Cranch— I lent him my translation of Ovid’s two heroids from Phyllis to Demophoon, and from Penelope to Ulysses, and asked him to compare them, with the originals, observing their contrasted characteristics, the moral de-ducible from them, and the difference in the measure of the versification which I purposely selected—one the ottava rima, in stanza’s, and the other the English Anapestic dodecasyllable verse, as suited to the condition of the writers, and to the sentiments adapted to the diversities of that condition, the seduced, betrayed and deserted maid, and the faithful, affectionate, anxious and devoted wife mother and daughter.— I called at the Bank of the Metropolis, and received for a check of the Speaker a draft on the Merchants bank at Boston, for 400 dollars; 425 dollars in gold and 60 cents in silver.— I exchanged at Charles J. Nourse’s Office 200 dollars of the gold for Virginia bank bills with a premium of 2 3/4 per cent. In Mr. Nourse’s office I met Mr Henry A. Wise, who spoke to me and offered me his hand—civilities, which I accepted and returned—though I should not have offered them, after his openly pointing to me in the house as the only man there unfit to be his judge, by supposed personal hostility to him, at the very moment when I was toiling to save him from all censure, and others were offering repeated motions for his expulsion— I went to the Capitol and took my seat in the house for the next Session, calling Follansbee the door keeper to witness it.— Met there H. Everett, and Stanly who was franking documents; and who thinks worse of Wise than I do. I took at the Clerk’s Office the supplementary document of Trist’s despatches.— At the National Intelligencer Office; saw Mr Seaton, and paid him a bill— Met there H. Clay, who was going to visit J. Sergeant sick— I followed him there, but Sergeant was too sick to receive me— Mr Henry Clay, and Mr Francis Granger paid me evening visits.— Much interesting conversation with both of them which I have not time to record— "

V— Wednesday—  Mr Kavasales came twice this morning to crave my interposition, by soliciting the new Secretary of the Navy AbelUpshur for the appointment of chaplain in the Navy which had been promised him by the late Secretary Badger— The Revd. Mr Henderson brought me a Letter of Recommendation from Mr J. J. Gurley— Mr Henderson is travelling to collect contributions for building a church at Galvezton in the Republic of Texas, an object for which I deem it the duty of the People of the Republic of Texas themselves to provide. Coll. Thomas was here; much concerned about the settlement of his accounts in which slow progress is made; and about his application for the Navy agency here, which he will not obtain.— I took the revised manuscript of my speech on the M’Leod Resolution to the Office of the National Intelligencer for publication— It was so wretchedly travestied by the man who took the Notes that I have had as much trouble with it, as I should have had to write it out in extenso— Mr Gales promised to publish it next Saturday, and to send me the proof slips to morrow evening. Met Stanly at the Office, who had just called at my house, and would call again to-morrow Morning, if he should postpone his departure till the afternoon— Gales told me that Mr Webster was very unwell, and I called at his house, but he was not there— I found him at the Office of the Department of State— I spoke of the Call from the house for the aggregates of the census adopted early in the Session at my motion—and enquired if I could be furnished with a copy of it before my departure— I enquired also, what was the present state of the Negotiation with Great Britain concerning the case of M’Leod. He said there had been no further correspondence, since that which was published till this day, when he had received from Mr Fox a Note, which he would shew me, if I would call at the office at 2— O’Clock to-morrow: and he would then also give me an answer respecting the aggregate of the census— We had much conversation upon the M’Leod case, but upon nothing else— This afternoon a person by the name of Perry, from Hagerstown Maryland but a native of Virginia and married to a Washington, came to request me to solicit President Tyler for the appointment of him as Postmaster at Hagerstown instead of Howard Kennedy to be removed— He told me a piteous tale of his wants and his losses, and shewed me, several Letters of ardent recommendation of him by members of Congress to the late Postmaster general, some of them quite as earnestly urging the removal of the present Postmaster, Kennedy. I walked down to Mr Frye’s stopping on my way to hear the music in the presidential grounds— With Mrs Smith, Mary and her daughter Mary-Louisa, I spent the Evening at Mr Frye’s— T. B. J. Frye went off equip’d for a shooting party down the river to-morrow. "

I had not— Mr John Pope came and took leave of the family; about to return home, and intending to bring his wife and family with him at the winter Session.— Thomas Wyatt is an Englishman now publishing a catalogue of marine shells with coloured plates, for 15 dollars which he says cost in England, 48 dollars—by his subscription paper he required a payment of 5 dollars from each subscriber in advance. I paid him ten— He said he was obliged to pay 2000 dollars for the engraving and colouring of his plates, and in calling for 200 subscribers to contribute 1000 dollars of the fund, he would add the other thousand from his own resources— He added that he had been reduced to the necessity of resorting to this expedient, having lost 15000 dollars, nearly the whole of his fortune, 15000 dollars by the catastrophe of the Bank of the United States.— Edward Stanly, a member of the House from North-Carolina, called to take leave— He has excellent principles, and a lofty Spirit; with a quick perception, an irritable temper and a sarcastic turn of mind, sparing neither friend nor foe.— He is the terror of the Lucifer party, and Wise made that desperate attempt last week to scale him on the floor, by which he only succeeded in flooring himself— Stanly’s spirit is not to be subdued, but the thunderbolt of heaven has fallen upon the whigs, and he with all the honest men of the party is disheartened and perplexed.— We have no hope, but in the redeeming power of Heaven, to overrule for good the seemingly most calamitous events.— A man by the name of Samuel Woodruff came to beg—the ruin of a Gentleman and a scholar— In rags—drunk with alcohol, and begging for money to carry him in the cars to Baltimore. His appearance was shocking—his demeanor almost frantic. He said the President’s son John Tyler, had grossly insulted him— Mr Thomas Harrison came to solicit again my influence to obtain for him the appointment of surveyor of the customs at Boston— Mrs Reed was here this afternoon, to enquire about a manuscript Tragedy of Medea, written by her daughter Miss Read; which at her request Mr Barker Burnell some time since put into my hands to read and which is quite a creditable production— I have not yet read it through; but Mrs Reed requested me to leave it here, on my departure for home, and said she would call and take it. Miss Reed is about 25 years of age.  I called twice this day at the Department of State—the first time the Secretary, Webster, was not at the Office—so I passed over to the Treasury Department, and saw Mr Walter Forward, the new Secretary— I spoke to him upon two subjects— 1. The Smithsonian fund—of the history of which he is ignorant, and of which from the civil, courteous, and wholly indifferent manner in which he received my communications, I presume he will care just as little as did his predecessors Ewing and Woodbury— I told him what I had done, and what I propose to do; and he promised to send me a statement of the present condition of the fund and the amount of the stocks of the several States which have been purchased under the authority of the 6th. Section of the West Point Academy appropriation of 1838— And 2. I spoke of the Resolution of the house, adopted at my motion on the 23d. of July last, calling on the Secretary of the Treasury for a report upon the debts of the several States— Mr Forward appeared not to have heard, or not to have thought of that Resolution— But he said he would attend to it, and that he would write to the Secretaries of the several States to collect the information— I then returned to the Department of State, and found Mr Webster, who told me he was very unwell, and who appeared to be in no very good humour— Neither Weaver, nor any one of the clerks employed on the census returns was there, and he told me I was too late, when it was not 3. O’Clock, and I had been there an hour before, and found him not at the office.— But he promised to send me an answer on this subject to morrow—and he gave me to take home with me and read, Mr Fox’s note of the 5th. of this month upon the case of M’Leod— It is an instruction deeply earnest to Fox from his Government, upon the opinion of the judge of the Supreme Court of the State of New-York; reminding Mr Webster that he had admitted the exemption of M’Leod, from all individual criminality for acts done under the authority of his Government, and expressing the deep anxiety of the British Government, for the preservation of Peace and their reliance upon the corresponding disposition of the President. Towards Evening I called to see Mr T. B. Johnson who was not at home— I then called on Mr John Bell, the late Secretary of War, whom I found with a large coal fire in his room— I had some conversation with him; but we were twice interrupted by other visitors—the second time by Dr Crump, who I supposed came on business, and therefore took my leave— I received this Evening from the National Intelligencer Office the proof slips of my speech on the M’Leod Resolution.

I revised the proof slips of my Speech delivered on the 4th. instt on the M’Leod Resolution, the language of which wholly extemporaneous is mean and tautological, full of repetitions and desultory, but has the merite de l’apropos. The Speech has for the time saved Webster from the catastrophe which has befallen his colleagues— It has given him the means of saving himself from ruin, and his country from a most disastrous and cruel War— My reward from him will be professions of respect and esteem speeches of approbation and regard for me to my friends, knowing that they will be reported to me; secret and deep laid intrigues against me, and still more venomously against my son— Such is human nature, in the gigantic intellect, the envious temper, the ravenous ambition, and the rotten heart of Daniel Webster— His treatment of me has been, is, and will be an improved edition of Andrew Jackson’s gratitude— But these are things according to Plutarch, not to be told in the biographies of great men— I took the slips to the office of the National Intelligencer, and left them with Mr Gales for publication to-morrow. Gales says that Caleb Cushing wrote some of the most inflammatory Letters against the late cabinet published in the New-York Herald— I went next to the Capitol, but neither Mr Clark the clerk of the house, nor Burch was there— I bespoke the remaining sheets of the Journals of both houses, and the indexes to be sent to me at Quincy— I called at judge Cranch’s, and took a Letter from Mrs Cranch to Quincy. He had not yet read my two heroids; but promised to send them back to me before next Monday— He liked the measure of the Stanza, better than the Anapestic Alexandrine— After I came home, I had a long call from Dr. George B. Todsen, still an unsuccessful applicant for a petty office— Mr Frye and his Son the Doctor dined and took tea with us— Mrs Frye was unwell and could not come— I was able to write this Evening, and employed industriously the time— A rare blessing.  It was on Saturday last the 11th. of September that Thomas Ewing Secretary of the Treasury, John Bell, Secretary of War, George E Badger Secretary of the Navy, and John J. Crittenden Attorney General, and afterwards Francis Granger Postmaster General, resigned their offices— On the same day, Walter Forward of Pennsylvania was nominated Secretary of the Treasury— John M’Lean of Ohio, now a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, Secretary of War— Abel P. Upshur of Virginia Secretary of the Navy, Hugh S. Legare of South-Carolina, Attorney General, and on Monday Charles A. Wickliffe of Kentucky Post-Master General; all of whom were confirmed by the Senate before their adjournment on that day. "

                "text": "18. V:30. Saturday.  I had received while Minott Thayer was here a Letter from Elisha Whittlesey, auditor of the general Post-Office making some enquiries concerning the solvency of Simeon White late Postmaster at East Randolph— Mr Thayer promised to make enquiry on his return home— Mr Whittlesey had called on me, three days ago for an answer—day before yesterday I received Mr Thayer’s report, and this morning communicated it to Mr Whittlesey at his Office— Mr White is solvent but careless.— I asked Mr Whittlesey why the annual report of the receipts from the post Offices had been for several years discontinued—he said he did not know; but had two clerks now employed in making it up. There has been none since 1835. My next call was at the Treasury Department where I requested of the Secretary, Forward, a more particular statement of the State Stocks in which the Smithsonian funds principal and interest have been invested. At the Department of State I returned to Mr Webster, Mr Fox’s note of the 5th. instt— He said he thought of answering it by saying that M’Leod would be tried, at his own solicitation by jury on the 27th. of this month—and that if he should not be acquitted, there will be an appeal to the court of Errors of the State of New-York, and from them to the Supreme Court of the United States— My Speech on the M’Leod Resolution was published in the National Intelligencer this morning. Mr Webster asked me to have it published in a pamphlet and said he would order 1000 copies of it, for circulation— He said the Great Western had arrived at New-York— That the New Parliament had assembled in England— That the address against the Ministers had been carried in the house of Commons by a majority of 91. and the Queen had sent for Sir Robert Peel, and authorised him to form a Ministry at his discretion— That the subject of M’Leod’s detention had been noticed in Parliament, and he read me in the New-York Herald of yesterday an extract from a Speech of Lord Palmerston, fully confirming the statement made in my Speech that Mr Webster’s Letter to Mr Fox ofApril, and the Instructions to the Attorney General, had softened down and conciliated in an eminent degree the bitterness and exasperation provoked by the previous communications from the Van Buren administration, and Pickens’s report last winter— I asked Mr Webster, if Mr Tyler fully concurred in the proceedings of the administration, upon this subject before the decease of President Harrison— He said he did, and reminded me that his Letter to Mr Fox was dated some weeks after Mr Tyler had assumed the Office of President of the United States— The census aggregates were not ready for me, but Mr Webster promised and directed that a copy of them should be made up, and sent to me at Quincy, next week— From the Department of of State I passed over to the President’s house and saw Mr Tyler— His Son Robert was with him and Dixon H. Lewis of Alabama the man mountain, with his wife, on a take leave visit like mine— They soon withdrew, and I spoke to Mr Tyler about the Smithsonian fund, and the debts of the States.— There are now 620000 dollars invested in State Stocks bearing an interest of 6 per cent a year, payable half yearly— I told him I had at length succeeded in two measures at the recent session of Congress.— one by introducing into the bill for distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, the 4th. section whereby the portion coming at any time to any State, shall be first applied to the payment of any debt principal or interest from the State to the United States; and the other by the repeal of the 6th. Section of the West Point Appropriation act of 7. July 1838. which required the investment of the accrueing interest in States Stocks, and substituting the investment of them in Stocks of the United States— Though this has been attended much against my will with authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to reduce the interest from 6 per cent a year which the State bonds now bear to not less than 5— The Secretary of the Treasury has obtained one Million or a Million and a half of the 12 million loan authorised at the recent session of Congress at 5 1/2 per cent—but he wants already two millions more and has no prospect of obtaining them at a rate lower than 6 per cent, if at that; and I said if there should be an investment of the next semi-annual interest I hoped it would not be taken at a lower rate of interest than 6. per cent. But I was extremely desirous that the United States should not assume but resume the whole responsibility of that fund, and look themselves to the States for their punctuality of payment— Mr Tyler, in general terms approved of these observations, and assured me, that he would co-operate cordially with me for the faithful application of these funds to the purposes of the testator— He said he had my Letter to the late Secretary Ewing, and had read it.— I spoke also of the call of H.R.U.S. on the Secretary of the Treasury, for a report on the State debts, and gave him some of my views upon that deeply interesting public concern— He certainly did not concur with them; neither did he controvert them. When I suggested to him the certainty that the European Governments will ultimately hold the United States responsible for these State debts, he looked grave but made no remark.— I went lastly to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and requested Mr. Seaton to print my M’Leod Resolution Speech, in a pamphlet, and send me 100 copies of it to Quincy. I told him that Mr Webster had said he would order 1000 copies. Seaton lamented the manner in which the whig presses are assailing Webster— I spent an hour of this Evening with Mr Thomas B. Johnson.

At the second presbyterian church this morning Mr. M’Lane preached from John 14.27— “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.” This is a most affecting text, and a suitable them for a pathetic discourse; but it is not peculiarly adapted to the calvinistic creed, and Mr M’Lane did not make much of it— In the afternoon at St. John’s church, a Stranger, quite a young man read the Evening service for the 15th. Sunday after Trinity, and the Bishop of Maryland Whittingham, preached from John 4.10. “Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is, that saith to thee, give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.” and John 7.37. “In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood, and cried, saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink 38. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water”— The meaning of the words living water, he said in both these passages was identical; and was explained in the next verse of the 7th. chapter 39. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given: because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) The whole reference of both passages was to the outpouring of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost, as related in the second chapter of the Acts— And this gift of the holy ghost was the prototype and origin of the rite of confirmation which he was about to administer— The whole argument of the Sermon was to maintain the rather untenable position that this ceremony of confirmation was in substance the same thing with that gift of the holy ghost to the apostles on the day of Pentecost— There is not a little ecclesiastical presumption not to say arrogance in this pretension— It implies the authority of the right reverend bishop to confer the gift of the holy ghost. And the only difference which he recognized between the miracle of the day of Pentecost, and his laying on of hands, for confirmation, was the descent of fire from heaven on the former occasion which he called a paltry circumstance; and repeated the words— He finished by administering this rite of confirmation successively to ten women, among whom was Mrs Forsyth, and three men, one of them at least 60. years of age; all with profound, and dignified episcopal humility. Returning from Church, I met Mrs David Hoffman of Baltimore and her daughter, returning from the Virginia Springs. In the Evening, I called in to take leave of my neighbour Albion K. Parris and his family. Mr Richard Cutts and his daughter were here— Mr Whittlesey and three of his sons, and Mr Charles A. King the Painter. "

His claim is founded on the fact that he ruined himself by borrowing money of banks to build four houses, in Pennsylvania avenue— When he got through the work pay day came and returned, till it could no longer be postponed. The houses were sold at quarter cost at sheriffs’ sales; Mr Elliot says he honestly paid all his debts, and has nothing left; not even enough to supply him with daily bread. Mr Gould brought with him and left with me a copy of his dissertation upon Commonplace book keeping and indexing He asked my autograph signature to another which I gave— Call at the Treasury Department— Saw there Mr John Pope; who is extremely anxious for the appointment of his brother Nathaniel, as a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the place of Judge M’Lean, if he should accept the offer.— The chief-clerk of the Department, M’Clintock Young, told me that the Document respecting the investment of the Smithson funds was not yet completed—nor the report of the auditor, upon the claim of Henry Lunt for prize-money—but that as soon as they shall be ready he will send them to me at Quincy.— I then called at the Department of State; and met coming out of the Secretary’s chamber as I went in, the new Attorney General Hugh S. Legaré, who immediately said to me that he had read my Speech on the M’Leod Resolution— I said jokingly I hoped it would help him in his argument— He said most certainly it would. I spoke to Mr Webster of the Memorial from the protectors of the Amistad Africans to the President, praying that provision may be made for transporting them to Africa in one or more of the public ships which may be ordered upon that Coast.— He requested me to see and speak to the President concerning it— And he promised to call and see me on his way to Marshfield, where he proposed shortly to pay a visit— I went to the Navy Department, but the Chief Clerk and acting Secretary Semms was with the President— At the War Department Major Lea the Chief Clerk, acts as Secretary till the arrival of judge M’Lean— I reminded him of the promise made to me by the late Secretary Bell, that Mrs Derby’s son should receive a warrant of Cadet at West Point Academy next Summer— At the Pension Office, I left with Mr Edwards a Letter from Jacob H. Loud concerning a widow’s pension claim, and spoke to him concerning the claim of Phebe Thayer. He promised to report to me upon both. At the President’s. Conversation concerning the Amistad Africans. He has no recollection of the memorial addressed to him on this subject Spoke of the Colonization Society—also of his great solicitude for W. S. Smith— Catlet at the Presidents house. At C. J. Nourse’s Office and the Bank of Washington— At the Office of the National Intelligencer— Badger and Crittenden were there— My Letter to be published to morrow— Capitol— Burch will have my Sonnet to the Sun-dial— Walter Hellen, Miss Cutts, Mrs Greenough and her Son here this Eve— "

Badger with three Sons, the eldest about 5 and the youngest under 1 year of age—Mrs Matthew St. Clair Clark, the three sons of Mr Whittlesey and Dr Sewall were of the company; Mr Badger and his family joining us, and Dr Sewall, leaving us, at Baltimore, where we arrived at 20 minutes after 8.

Immediately after breakfast Julia De Windt came in as a visitor— Mr and Mrs Downing went yesterday for Boston— Mr and Mrs Whittemore have a son, named De Windt— I walked to Peck’s slip on the East river and engaged a State-room for Mary and her daughter, and a berth for myself in the Steamer New-York to depart for Norwich at 5 this afternoon— A coincidence—another man named Adams engaged at the same time the other State-room, for himself, wife and baby. I called then at Arthur Tappan’s shop, and thence went to Lewis Tappan’s Office, N. 7. Exchange building. Found Mr Joslyn there with him— Long conversation with them respecting the Amistad Africans— They were about writing to the Secretary of State for an answer to their Memorial to the President, requesting that the Africans may be sent home in a public vessel or vessels— I told them of my interviews with the Secretary of State, and the President, before my departure from Washington, and of my impression that the President will do nothing on the subject without a previous act of Congress. I mentioned that he had either not read or did not remember their memorial to him, and that he proposed to me to shift off upon the Colonization Society, the burden of sending the Mendians to Africa, while the Society itself is begging crumbs from the Southern Slaveholders, to pay its debts and ship off some of their emancipated Slaves— These gentlemen are very anxious to send all the Africans, including the young girls home, this autumn— But in that they will certainly be disappointed. Mr Leavitt is gone to Albany— I went on board of the Steamer Rhode-Island at the Battery wharf, going this afternoon for Stonington. Returning to the Astor-house I found there Mr Isaac T. Smith, of the New-York Lyceum, with whom I went by his invitation to their reading room and library—where my name as a visitor— I took leave then of Mr Smith, and called at N. 365 Broadway; to see Mr Charles A. Davis, but he was gone to a festive convocation, on the opening of the New-York and Erie Railway as far as Goshen. I found Dr Frothingham of Boston with Mrs Davis— He went with me to the Astor house, to visit Mary and her daughter— He had engaged his passage for Boston in the Steamer for Stonington this afternoon— My namesake the past Midshipman J. Q. Adams, visited us also at the Astor house. He is attached to the schooner Flirt, instead of the revenue cutter Madison, and ordered to the Coast of Florida. We dined at the Astor house, and at half past 4. O’Clock embarked at Peck’s slip in the Steam-boat New-York, for Boston, by the way of Norwich and Worcester. Fellow-passengers all Strangers. "

In the tediousness of solitary wakeful hours, I sometimes struggle to beguile the time by hitching together rhymes, and thus in the cars this morning between Norwich, Worcester and Boston I composed three Stanzas of eight lines as disjointed as the state of my own mind— I committed them to paper in the course of the day, and that was all I could do— I could not even resume the broken thread of my diary— I visited my Garden, Orchard, Nursery and seminary to see the ravages of drought, worms and caterpillars among my seedling trees, which are greater than they ever were before, in proportion as the Season is more advanced.— Charles returned from Boston, before dinner. He and his wife passed the Evening with us. His Sons John Quincy and Charles Francis were here, most of the day— Henry Brooks, not out. "

                "text": "24. V. Friday.  John A. Green, editor of the Quincy Patriot, came this morning with of the paper to be published to-morrow upon which was printed about half the Stanzas of my ballad upon “the Wants of Man” He was reprinting it from the United States Gazette, which had taken it from the Albany Evening journal, which first made it public, from the copy sent by Morgan to Thurlow Weed. Many errors of the press had crept into it, and it was without the eighth Stanza, written after Morgan had sent off his copy, and first published in the National Intelligencer. I revised Mr Green’s slip, and gave him a copy of the additional Stanza— Mr Green sent me this Evening the slip containing the remaining Stanza’s the whole now being 26.— Nothing that I ever wrote was half so popular, though it was chance begotten, to make autographs for poor Charles Ogle’s Note paper, and though the full copy had remained in my Port-folio fourteen months, to dumb forgetfulness a prey; till I accidentally mentioned, it and afterwards lent it to John P. Kennedy to read— What a lesson this might be to me, if I knew how to improve it!— A youth of 15. named Edward Clark Grafton came out from Boston, and brought me a Letter of introduction from P. P. F. Degrand— He is an applicant for a midshipman’s warrant, and came to solicit my influence. Talked of going himself to Washington, which I told him would in no wise advance his suit— There was rain great part of this day, and a sultry, drowsy, South-west wind. I attempted time after time to sit down, and write to retrieve the arrears of this diary from last Monday, and found myself dropping asleep over the page— I wrote nevertheless to Mr Webster for a copy of the full returns of the census— And to William S. Smith enclosing a key of the black leather trunk, which I had packed up at Washington to bring with me; and which I was then obliged to leave behind because the key of it could not be found— I request him to lock and ship off the trunk, and to send me back the key by the Mail— And this afternoon, finding that I could not write, I walked to Mrs T. B. Adams’s— Met on my way the Revd. Mr Lunt, who was coming to pay me a visit, but turned back and returned home. Between Mr Edward Miller’s house and that of Mrs Adams, I met her and her Sister Mrs Foster going to Mr Miller’s to tea. Mrs Adams said to try how other people’s tea tasted. She turned back with me, to her own house where we found her daughters, Mrs John Angier, and Elizabeth C. Adams. I made a short visit, as they were all going to tea at Mrs Miller’s; and returned home, where Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us. Charles had gone into Boston again this morning, and returned home to dine. I went up the hill this forenoon, and spent an hour with his wife— Saw there their third son Henry Brooks born1838. and for the first time, the fourth, born the 23d. of last July, a fine promising child, as are all the others.

                "text": "25. IV. Saturday.  My Son sent me this morning a copy of the publication which he has just made in two duodecimo volumes of 300 Letters from my father to my mother from 12 May 1774 to 16. Feby 1801. This is a sequel to the previous publication by him of my mother’s Letters to my father and others, made about this time last year in one duodecimo volume, and of which the second and third edition in two volumes, are already nearly exhausted. An excellent memoir of my mother’s life, precedes the collection of her Letters; and a short but very judicious preface accompanies this second compilation— In the interval between the two, Mrs Caroline Amelia De Windt, my Sister’s only daughter, of Cedar grove Fishkill Landing, on Hudson’s river New-York, has published a similar volume of my sister’s journal, on her first visit to Europe and residence in England and France, together with a memoir of the life of her husband Coll. William Stephens Smith, and a few Letters to her from him and from other persons. These volumes have brought our family into public notice more than they ever had been before, and impose upon all those of us who survive, or who may hereafter bear the name a redoubled obligation, if not to prove worthy of it, at least to preserve it from disgrace by vice or crime. The weather continued sultry, with successive showers till this afternoon towards the setting of the Sun when it cleared up with promise of a cool fair day to morrow— I called at the Quincy Stone bank, and deposited the draft of 400 dollars from the Bank of the Metropolis at Washington, upon the Merchants Bank in Boston; and we all, that is, my wife, my daughter Mrs John Adams, her daughter Mary Louisa, and Louisa C. Smith, dined with Charles and his family on the hill— They were disappointed in the company they had expected from Boston, Mr Peter C. Brooks, and Mr and Mrs Andrew Jackson Downing of Newburgh in the State of New-York. We took tea and spent the Evening also at Charles’s house—where in the course of the evening, Elizabeth C. Adams came in with her brother the passed midshipman Joseph Harrod. I made out this day to recover one day of my journal’s arrears— My excusatory Letter, to invitations from Colleges, Lyceums and other Literary Associations which I had left unanswered was published in the National Intelligencer on the 21st. instt. that I left Washington— On the same day was published in the same paper the Letter of George E. Badger, late Secretary of the Navy, assigning his reasons for resigning that office— In that Journal, of the next day appeared a Letter from John Bell, the late Secretary of War, with a statement of facts, for the same exculpatory purpose on his part.— Two Letters from Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, one to the Editors of the Intelligencer, and the other to Hiram Ketchum of New York, have assigned to the public his reasons for not resigning his office— The whole of this controversy has assumed too much of a personal character; but its inevitable result will be the total overthrow of the whig party throughout the union.

I found them at the door of the stone Temple where the service of the day was performed by Mr Joseph Allen of Northborough. His morning sermon was from Acts 26.25. “But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.” The argument of the Discourse that Religion, is a reasonable thing, and no evidence of insanity, in its professors— It would seem as if not much reasoning can be necessary to prove that, but it was urged with much earnestness by the preacher— Not however with much reference to the Laws of Nature and of human existence, as from authority of great names—Newton, Milton, Locke, Addison whose deathbed advice to his stepson the Earl of Warwick was related—and especially from Washington, whose piety stands duly attested— Mr Allen dined with us; with Mr and Mrs Downing, Mr Degrand from Boston, and my Son. Mr Allen’s afternoon discourse was from Luke 17.20. [“]And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: 21. Neither shall they say, Lo here! or Lo there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.” The word observation here means ostentation— Charles Thomson’s translation has it “commence with parade[”]—and Martin’s French translation—avec éclat. The declaration to the Pharisees that the kingdom of God was within them applied perhaps more to others than to them— Mr Allen is about 50 years of age, was graduated at Cambridge in 1811. a Classmate of Edward Everett, and has been settled 25 years at Northborough, the successor to Mr Peter Whitney’s father. He married a daughter of the elder professor Ware, with whom I occupied a chamber at Cambridge, from March 1786. when I entered college till the commencement of that year, then held in July. Mr Allen is a preacher of a class intermediate between the old and the new School— Mrs John Angier and Elizabeth C. Adams were here after church. Mr and Mrs Downing with Mrs John Adams and Mary Louisa, went and passed the evening at Mrs T. B. Adams, and returned to lodge here. Josiah Quincy junr spent the evening with us, and Degrand left us about 9. P.M. He brought out as usual a budget of Newspapers, in one of which is a Letter from Daniel Webster to the two U.S. Senators from Massachusetts Isaac C. Bates and Rufus Choate, dated 26. August, supplicating a postponement of the Bank Question, till the winter Session of Congress, to ease the Conscience of President John Tyler— Also the private Letter from John M. Botts which Tyler sent back unopened— "

Monday—  Mr and Mrs Downing breakfasted with my Son, at his house upon the hill, and then left us to return to Boston and thence to morrow, for their residence at Newburgh—in the State of New-York. Mr Downing has a Nursery plantation at his place of abode, and published some months since in a handsome octavo volume a Treatise on the theory and practice of Landscape gardening, adapted to North-America; with a view of the improvement of country residences: containing historical notices and general principles of the art, directions for laying out grounds, and arranging plantations, the description and cultivation of hardy trees, decorative accompaniments to the house and grounds, the formation of pieces of Artificial water, flower gardens &c with remarks on Rural Architecture, illustrated by engravings— This book he did me the honour of dedicating to me. Mrs Downing is the eldest daughter of John Peter De Windt, and of Caroline Amelia, only daughter of my Sister, wife of Coll. William Stephen Smith—  This morning I had a visit from our aged Minister, Revd. Peter Whitney, my junior by four years at Harvard University where he entered the same year, that I was graduated 1787—now 72 years old, 40 of which he has been settled as pastor of the first, and until within a few years the only congregational religious Society in Quincy. His present condition is a memento to me of my own— All his physical senses failing, he still attempts occasionally to preach, and stumbles through his service as he can— The duties of the office are performed by his colleague, Mr Lunt. This afternoon Russell Freeman came out from Boston with George Adams, brother of Joseph T. Adams, sometime Editor of the Boston Centinel, and now a hopeless applicant for office at Washington. Freeman has been a constant applicant for re-appointment as Collector of the Customs at New-Bedford, ever since he was removed from it in the first year of the reign of Andrew Jackson— It has been ever since in faithless hands, and has been now recently trusted to others probably not more trustworthy— Freeman is very indignant, but still more imploring— He came in search of encouragement to go again to Washington, having already been there twice since the downfall of the Van Buren Administration, and resided the weeks each time, and as he says at an expense of near 500 dollars— I advised him not to go, and assured him, that if he should he would meet with nothing but disappointment— He shifted his trumpet; but did not take snuff— I saw the Sun rise and set from Charles’s house; the Southern declination already too great, rising and setting 7 minutes after and before 6. I met Dr Palfrey with his wife and two daughters coming down the hill from Charles’s, returning to Boston— The Ladies took an afternoon ride, and Charles and his wife were successively here, part of the Evening— "

IV:45 Tuesday  Mr Cornell, heretofore pastor of the orthodox, so called congregational church in this town, and now teacher of a private school visited me this morning—he is also this year President of the Quincy Lyceum, and came to invite me to deliver the introductory Lecture before that Institution, in the last week of next Month, or the first or second week in November to the course for the winter—which I agreed to do. In the summer of 1835. Mr. Cornell a graduate of Brown University then very recently settled as the first minister of the Calvinistic church, just before erected, in the overflowings of missionary zeal wrote some strictures upon the moral and religious character of the inhabitants of Quincy at which the felt themselves much aggrieved and they held two town meetings and appointed a committee of which I was chairman to vindicate their good name— They had a correspondence with Mr Cornell from which he extricated himself as well as he could; and the Committee reported resolutions, accepted by the town, declaring the imputations cast upon them by Mr Cornell slanderous— Mr Cornell’s conduct throughout that transaction, was not more remarkable for candour than for Christian charity—but he continued to preach Calvinism a year of two longer. He then discovered that the performance of his pastoral duties was unpropitious to his health, resigned his office and opened a private school, which he still keeps, with good reputation, and some success— He says he has now forty scholars and the aid of an assistant.— It was through him, and at my recommendation that Henry Wood’s son, obtained admission this year as a Cadet at the United States Military Academy at West-Point— Since his retirement from the clerical profession, Mr Cornell has associated himself with the democracy as they call themselves, and by their means once attempted to obtain a vote of the town to expunge from the town records the resolutions of 1835. against his pious calumnies— He has also had aspirations to election as a representative of the town in the State Legislature— During the whole of this time he has fawned upon me, and acted with the party hostile to me. He often invites me to visit his school, and I actually attended one of his exhibitions last Spring— Mr Cornell is a worldly minded Saint—a character in no wise rare— I walked over the hills this afternoon, and under a large, sound, beautiful black oak tree found, fallen from their cups on the ground, about a pint pot full of acorns. I have been many years endeavouring to gather acorns from this tree, and have never been able to find any sound ones before— A parcel of boys were at the same time gathering shagbark walnuts from the trees in a row with my superb Oak— I did not disturb them in their pilfering, for there is a sort of Yankey common Law, which gives up hickory nuts as lawful spoils for the boys!— Charles spent the Evening with us, but not his wife— "

What a transition it is, from the bustle and excitement, diversified in its objects from day to day, during a Session of Congress at Washington, and the stagnant green surfaced pool of life, in this rural retreat!— I have been this whole day without the interruption of one visitor— At evening twilight I walked up the hill, to see Charles and his family, and he and his wife afterwards came, and passed the remainder of the evening with us.— I have brought up the arrears of this Diary, and with pressing necessary occupations especially of correspondence, an irresistible impulse continually entices me away, like the hare in his race with the tortoise, sometimes into flowery, often into thorny paths, till night overtakes me, with the proper business still to do, and time wasted in idleness— I have a passion for writing in verse, and want invention for fixing upon a subject— I awoke this morning, just before the old clock, in the entry adjoining my bed-chamber, struck four— I strain’d from hard bound brains eight lines an hour, and when the Clock struck five, which from the intensity of toil in working up the Stanza, seemed scarcely an interval of ten minutes, I rose, and upon lighting my lamp with a friction match, I sat down and wrote out the stanza— I discovered that it was nonsense! This frequently happens to me, and is very discouraging.— I read ten Letters each morning of the new collection published by my Son, and this evening I read some of the miscellaneous collection published by my niece Mrs Caroline Amelia De Windt— Her book is dedicated to me, and contains one Letter from me to her, and several from my father and mother—with part of my Sisters journal while she was first in Europe, and Letters to her from her husband on his excursion from London to Spain and Portugal in 1787. This afternoon by way of exercise, I went over to the farm house to search for documents of my own composition among the books and papers transmitted last Summer from Washington. I found only a chaotic mass, of pamphlets and consumed the time till day light disappeared, in unavailing efforts to separate them into some kind of order— I wrote a Letter of five lines to Schuyler Sampson at Plymouth, enclosing one from the Commissioner of Pensions James L. Edwards concerning a claim to a Pension of Mrs Goddard widow of a Surgeon in the Navy, who died in 1803— At the close of evening I looked into the first volume of Rousseau’s Nouvelle Héloïse, for the Letter containing the sneer upon the Science of blazonry—found it in the second and twentieth Letter, skim’d over all that preceded to find it— I first read this book when I was twelve years old and did not understand it— I read it again at 16. and thought the most exquisite portraiture of love that ever was written. It looks to me now like an ugly caricature. "

Heavy rain last evening and almost the whole night through— This was the day of the monthly Meeting of the Massachusetts historical Society, which it was my design to have attended—but the sky was so overcast with clouds and so threatening that I gave up the visit to Boston, and passed another quiet uninterrupted day, till towards evening, when I walked to see Mr and Mrs John Greenleaf, and their eldest daughter Mrs Lucy Dawes. Mr Greenleaf is nearly 80 years of age, 70 or more of which he has been totally blind; and for several years past he has been losing by degrees the sense of hearing— His wife was Lucy Cranch, second daughter of my Mother’s elder sister. She was born at Salem in September 1767. two months after me— They have both been for years with scarcely a spider’s thread hold upon life, but are now in health, much improved over that in which I saw them last Spring. Charles and his wife were here this evening; but he left us to pay a visit to Mr Lunt— There was a bare sprinkling of rain this afternoon and it cleared off for a Sunset promising fair for to-morrow— Mr John A. Green sent me for revisal a slip of the Quincy Patriot for next Saturday, with about a third part of my Speech in H.R.U.S. on the M’Leod Resolution, for my revisal. He came for it late this evening, and I returned it to him— I read this morning ten of my father’s Letters to my mother written in 1775 and 1776. and this evening I finished reading those in the volume published by Mrs De Windt. The latter, none of which I had before seen affected me beyond measure— If ever there were angels upon earth they were my mother and my sister— If ever an Archangel it was my mother— The Letters to Mrs De Windt herself are among the most precious of the collection— Taking the series, from that of 5. October 1761. to Mrs H. Lincoln, to that of 23. March 1818. to Mrs De Windt, a period of 57. years, and what a life do they display—from 17. to 74—the last written but 7. months before she died.— The virgin daughter—the friend—the wife—the sister—the mother, the grandmother—the neighbour—the stranger—the Patriot—the Christian; is there a relation between human beings, of which a perfect model might not be drawn by analysing the composition of these Letters?— How small by their side are those of Madame de Sevigné, all charming as they are, or those of Lady Mary Wortley Montague, sprightly and intelligent, but cold hearted and sarcastic as they are— And how comprehensive—how energetic—how profound are the Letters of my father! They overawe me— I dare not turn upon them a critical eye— Take the three compilations together, and the English language cannot shew their parallel— Will my country understand them?— I began a Letter in answer to Mr Grace.

Transition to an autumnal Northwester-morning frost and clear sky, but with a border of black cloud along the eastern horizon, and intercepting the view of the rising Sun— The day differed altogether from its two immediate predecessors, by a constant series of interruptions from visitors, and consequent loss of time— Mr Oliver is at present an inhabitant of Brookline near Boston, but reminded me that he had heretofore been an alderman of Boston, and during the mayoralty of Mr Quincy, had dined with me at his house in this town— He is now going on a tour to Plymouth and called to see me on his way.— Next came Mr Isaac T. Smith, whom I had seen last week at New-York, and who notwithstanding the notice which I had then given him, and had even published in the National Intelligencer of my inability to deliver Lectures during the approaching Season still came to request a Lecture for the New-York Lyceum— He said also that they proposed requesting me to sit for my portrait, but had not fixed upon the painter— They thought of Rembrant Peale at Philadelphia— I said he had painted me once, and was not very successful in the likeness. And I told him definitively that it was so very uncertain when I can deliver any lecture, that it is impossible for me to contract any positive engagement; but that if on my way to Washington I should find it practicable to stop a day or two at New-York I have invitations from several other associations in that city, which would have a prior claim upon my compliance to that of the Lyceum, before which I have already delivered two Lectures. Elizabeth C. Adams dined with us— My Son went to Boston, and brought back his daughter Louisa Catherine from her eight days visit to her uncle and aunt Sidney Brooks at Watertown— Since my wife returned from Washington, this child has been generally staying with her, and is to continue with her now till her departure for the South— Mr Lunt paid me a visit this afternoon. I lent him a dissertation upon the scriptural doctrines concerning marriage and divorce, by a person named Wheelock, of the adjoining town of Milton; printed in the form of a folio-newspaper, and which I received this morning from I know not whom with Letters by the mail. Mr Lunts hymn book will not be published before the first of November— Stereotyped— He prints 1500 copies, the cost of which will be about 1000. dollars. He expects it will be adopted by his own church here, by Dr Frothingham’s Church in Boston, and by a church at Plymouth.— A young man named Rowan, came with a subscription paper, for contributions to enable him to qualify himself for the professor, of the Law, by attendance at the Law school at Cambridge— As a reward and encouragement for his conversion from intemperance. We took tea, and spent the Evening at Charles’s on the hill— "

Mr Curtis came over this morning from Roxbury, and left with me Letters received from Petty Vaughan since we wrote to him last May— He has enclosed a Letter to him of 17. June from his Fenchurch street Solicitors Teasdale Symes and Weston, urging the necessity of our executing as Executors of Ward Nicholas Boylston and myself as Administrator de bonis non, with the Will annexed by Thomas Boylston, the Deed of Release and indemnity to Petty Vaughan, which they had drawn up for him; which he sent us last Spring to sign and seal, but which we then declined to do— On reading over the Letter of the Solicitors I thought it furnished additional reason for us to persist in declining to sign the deed of release and indemnity, and Mr Curtis concurred in that opinion— I promised to prepare a reply and to see Mr Curtis again next week— He told me that John Lane Boylston was about removing with his family from Princeton to Providence Rhode-Island, and that Mrs Boylston his mother was going to live with him. She has been living three or four years at Mr Curtis’s house; but since the death of Mrs Curtis last winter, finds herself lonesome, and prefers to go and reside with her son—who turns out a poor farmer, and makes no headway on the Estate at Princeton— Morning visit from Mr Quincy, President of Harvard University— His son Coll. Josiah, has his family here for part of the Summer; but is now gone to Albany upon the business of the great Western Rail-road from Boston to Albany, which is to be opened on the first of next December— I asked President Quincy for the last triennial catalogue of graduates at Cambridge, which he promised to send me— He is well satisfied with the present condition of the University where they have now 240 undergraduates—and the law school flourishes beyond all former example numbering this day 120 pupils— The astronomical observatory is less fortunate; a troublesome person having purchased a lot and removed a barn to cover it directly intercepting their Meridian line— So that they have been obliged to change the site of their observatory. Deacon Spear was here this afternoon, and proposed to me a ride of inspection, before my return to Washington to view sundry roads which have been opened through my grounds. I agreed to go, but fixed upon no time— Mrs and Miss Torrey were here this afternoon—and with Mary Louisa, Mary Dawes, Mr Lunt’s two daughters, Charles’s Louisa and John Quincy, and Charles and his wife this Evening.

Sunday  The weather had all day yesterday the appearance of a gathering storm; and when I went to bed last Night the moon was visible but with clouds rapidly scudding over her face in wild disorder: when I came into my library this morning, a heavy gale with the rain pattering on my Northern closet windows announced a regular autumnal Northeastern storm which continued with unabated severity through the day— I rode with my Son, and his two elder sons, John Quincy and Charles Francis to Meeting, and home morning and afternoon— Mr Lunt’s morning text was from 1. Thessalonians 5.23. “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly: and I pray God your spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” entire sanctification was the subject of the discourse, and the various ways in which it is attended with imperfection were pointed out and exposed by deficiency—indifference to religion—by excess running into enthusiasm and fanaticism—by erroneous direction absorbed in unprofitable speculation, or swelling into overweening confidence and self justification— Mr Lunt gave notice that the administration of the communion which should have been on this day, was owing to the severity of the weather postponed until next Sunday— The afternoon Sermon was from Genesis 12.1. “Now the Lord said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show thee.”— The wonderful character and history of Abraham was presented in a summary of the principal events of his life recorded in the book of Genesis.— Mr Lunt dwelt with proper emphasis upon his faithfulness and remarked upon most of the trials to which it was subjected. Abram was of the 4th. generation in descent from Noah; but his immediate parents had degenerated into idolatry— It pleased Almighty God, to make him the chosen vessel through which his unity and omnipotence was revealed to mankind, and so fired in their hearts and minds that it should never again be extinguished. Why this special revelation was reserved for one man and his posterity for many ages, the holy Scriptures do not disclose; nor why that other revelation of man’s immortality and the retributions of a future life were withheld from Abraham and his descendants for so many ages and finally divulged by a lineal descendant from him in the person of Jesus Christ— From Abraham dates the doctrine of one supreme omnipotent creator of the universe and of man— From Jesus Christ dates the doctrine of eternal life and future rewards and punishments, those two first principles are the sources of all that is good and great in the Nature of Man, and for these two principles the world is indebted to the Hebrew Nation.

The storm continued through the Night, and the whole of this day with great violence; and when I went this morning to the wood house for wood to make my fire I found snow was falling— Here, it melted as it fell, but in our neighbourhood it momentarily bleached the ground and at Worcester, fell it is said four inches deep. Not quite so terrific as that which I witnessed in this same house on the 9th. of October 1804. but more like it than any thing I have met with since— It confined me all day to the house— Towards evening as the gale subsided, and the rain somewhat abated I was preparing to go up the hill to Charles’s house, but he, and his two elder sons came down here. They returned home however without staying to tea— My day was all but wasted— I received from Gales and Seaton at Washington, franked by the Clerk of H.R.U.S. Matthew St. Clair Clark, 100 pamphlet copies of my speech on John G. Floyds M’Leod Resolution—already as worthless as a last years almanac— I received also from the Department of State, franked by Fletcher Webster acting Secretary, a printed copy of the full returns of the census, which I had last week written to request— I directed the packet immediately to J. E. Worcester Esqr. Cambridge, and forwarded it with a few lines of Letter by this day’s mail. My Granddaughter Mary-Louisa, only surviving daughter of my dear deceased son John, reads to me now every morning one, and frequently two chapters of the French Bible of Martin—and I read to her the same chapters in the common English Bible— She also takes a lesson every morning in Fenning’s Algebra— With the four rules of Arithmetic and vulgar fractions she is already familiar, and she came of her own accord to me, and requested me to teach her the use of logarithms— I would cultivate these dispositions, and supply to her the place of a father—but how adequate can my power possibly be to my will? How deep are the disappointments of education! I have on hand at this moment— A commentary upon Mr Grace’s Dissertation upon the families of Adams and Quincy and a Letter to my niece Mrs De Windt on the publication of her book purporting to be the Journal, and Correspondence of my Sister— For the latter I want to send her my versification of the story of Charles the 5ths. Clocks, and I wasted hour after hour of this day in a fruitless search after it— My papers are in confusion I fear inextricable at least without the consumption of more time than I can possibly bestow upon the effort to arrange them so long as I shall remain in public life— I wrote something for Grace this Evening.

I am reading with my Granddaughter Mary Louisa the first book of Chronicles, she in French and I in English, alternately five verses at a time. We are studying also the vulgar fractions in Fenning’s algebra, and I am endeavouring by giving her tasks to copy to improve her hand-writing, which has been neglected— I take this occasion to renew the attempt I have heretofore, more than once made to form a collection of the numberless trifles in verse that I have written— There is no small number of them the manuscripts of which are mislaid, and for which I lost again much of this precious day in a luckless pursuit— But in ransacking over my old papers I found six Stanza’s of a version of John Baptist Rousseau’s ode to Fortune—deemed in the golden age of French Literature, the most beautiful Lyric effusion in that language. I had written these lines I think in the Summer of 1804—at all events more than thirty years ago, with the intention of completing the Translation, and sending it to Joseph Dennie for publication in the Port-Folio.— But after the sixth Stanza, My Muse deserted me— I stuck in the mire, and gave up the remainder of the task in Despair. I had forgotten that I ever had made the attempt; but now, with the exception of two or three inadmissible and wretched lines, the rest was too good to be lost, and I renewed the attempt to finish the Ode.— Of course there was nothing else to be done this day; and before going to bed I had struck off four of the nine remaining Stanzas, and taking the fifth with me to bed, had it all upon the brain before I slept— The version now is not so close as was that of the first six Stanza’s— The allusions to antient history, Greek and Roman, must be rendered rather by paraphrase than by translation— The Ode to Fortune is confined to the Fortune of War— Its theme is vicissitude, and invective against heroes— His examples are Alexander, Hannibal, Sylla, Varro the Roman Consul at the battle of Cannae whom he calls the compagnon de Paul—Emile, Augustus Caesar, Mark Antony, Lepidus, Varus, Tiberius, Attila, AEneas, and Scipio Africanus, who is not however named— He says nothing of modern heroes, though Charles the 12th. of Sweden must have been ready to his hand when the Ode was written.— Charles served Dr Johnson and on precisely the same moral doctrine as one example— Charles went to Boston this morning, and returned before dinner. He brought me the two Volumes of President Quincy’s History of Harvard University which is at last published.— Charles was here part of the Evening I finished reading the first volume of my father’s Letters.

I rose with Rousseau’s Ode to Fortune in my head, and could not shake the phantom off, till I had completed the version of the four remaining Stanza’s, and thus, of the whole Ode. It would now be a task for a sagacious critic to discover which part of my version was made at the age of 37. and which at the age of 74. and perhaps if I had made due progress in the art of self knowledge I might give an account why a task which at the former period, I gave up in despair, I found now upon resuming it, so easy to accomplish— The facility of composition is incomparably greater to me now, than it was then; but of original thought I have less now than then— In cases of translation the thoughts are all found ready to your hand, and all you have to do is to clothe them— Pope makes it his boast  So did Rousseau in this Ode— The Poem is far more contracted than its title. Dr Johnsons 32 lines upon Charles the 12th. in his Vanity of human wishes seems to embrace nearly all the substance of Rousseau’s Ode— But on the other hand perhaps the admirable 12th. Stanza of the Ode “Montrez nous, guerriers magnanimes”—contains the substance of all Johnson’s 32 lines.— Rousseau generalizes— Names no one but old Greeks and Romans, Goths and Vandals— Johnson specifies modern and controversial names— Is not this an indication of the different Governments under which the two Poets wrote— My translation and the original ode, are like a coarse broadcloth English frock coat, compared with an embroidered velvet habit de cour of the age of Louis quinze.— I had a morning visitor Joseph Hardwick collector of the parish tax who brought me a bill for 2 for the present year— I walked up the hill to Charles before dinner, to see his wife and children, and returned through the rain— Mr Beale, and his daughter Anne were here this Evening, and he spoke of two young men, who want to purchase house lots upon some of the land given by my father to the town— It reminded me, of the duty to call a meeting of the temple fund corporation— Louisa Catherine 2 who had gone up the hill on Sunday, returned here this Evening. The Acadia Steamer arrived at Boston yesterday after a passage of 16. days from Liverpool, the longest she has ever made— During the gale of Monday she was obliged to lay to 17 hours with her head to the wind. She brings a Messenger from Stevenson; since the opening of the tory Ministry. "

At length one fair day succeeds to the terrible gale which has made so many widows and orphans within the last four days— I read the Bible this morning with my two Granddaughters, and Mary Louisa has not yet tired of her Lessons of Algebra and in the use of Logarithms— They absorb much of my time, but I am willing to believe, that none of my time was ever more usefully employed— Would that I could faithfully discharge my whole duty to this child!— My poetics are far more questionable, and it is much against my will, that they encroach so much upon my proper labours— This afternoon I planted in my seminary patches a number of black oak acorns, and peach stones which I brought with me from Washington; and I gathered perhaps a half gallon of shagbark walnuts wind fallen from my old tree in the garden; the nut of which was planted by my own hand about the 10th. of October 1804.— Mr Green, the Editor of the Quincy Patriot, brought me this afternoon a slip for his next Saturday’s paper, being the second half of my speech on the M’Leod Resolution—the first part of which was published last Saturday— On comparing it with the pamphlet edition I detected and marked several egregious errors of omission, which Green promised to have corrected. Alonzo Taft, a grandson of the minister in the time of my boyhood of the parish which now constitutes the town of Randolph came to ask my assistance to obtain repayment to him of a sum paid by him for his passage from Gibraltar in 1825. He was sent home from the Mediterranean Squadron then commanded by Commodore Rodgers— He made application for this claim, upon the late Secretary of the Navy Paulding, but failed to obtain it, by deficiency of evidence. He has now an affidavit from the Master of the vessel which brought him. I advised him to add his own statement upon oath, and then send the papers to me—promising to do all I can to obtain payment of his claim— He told me that he had heretofore been intemperate in his habits, but was now wholly reformed.— Dr Bemis and Mr Foster came from Charlestown and invited me to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum in that town, as I did last year. I told them I could make no positive engagement; but if as was possible I should pass a week or ten days in Boston, before my return to Washington, and there should be an Evening, which I could devote to the purpose, I would do it— Mr Cornell and Mr Spear came to request that I would deliver a Lecture before the Quincy Lyceum next Wednesday, which I promised and another hereafter which I took ad referendum.

                "text": "8: V. Friday.  Another dull, sunless day—lowering from Sunrise till afternoon, followed by steady rain till deep into the Night— I had received from William Lincoln, a warm and earnest invitation to attend the Cattle-show, ploughing match, and exhibition of manufactures at Worcester next Wednesday— The answer of Barzillai the Gileadite to the invitation of king David, would serve as a model for me henceforth to answer all such applications to participate in multitudinous festivities. I answered Mr Lincoln’s Letter, pleading an engagement which I have for that day, for respectfully declining the visit to Worcester, and sending them a toast, according to the approved fashion of declinatures of the present day— My Granddaughter Mary engaged also much of the morning with her lessons in Fenning’s Algebra, and in practising the use of Logarithms— I have received a Letter from Samuel Hazard at Philadelphia, enclosing a copy of a Letter from my father dated Quincy 24. Jany. 1813. to the late John Langdon of Portsmouth, New Hampshire making certain enquiries, and stating certain facts respecting the first establishment of an American naval force during the War of our Revolution— Mr Hazard says that he has been permitted by the family of the late Governor Langdon, to take this copy of my father’s Letter, and he enquires whether I have among my fathers papers found Governor Langdons reply—and if so requesting a copy of it with permission to make use of it in his Register, if deemed expedient. My wife has been looking over files of my fathers papers, and very soon found Governor Langdon’s answer to the Letter of my father of 24. Jany 1813— It is dated 27. Jany 1813. and confirms every fact stated in my fathers Letter. My Granddaughter Mary-Louisa very soon made a copy of it for Mr Hazard, but with it was found another Letter from Governor Langdon of 8. July 1813. in answer to one from my father of the 3d. of that month, with which he had enclosed “sketches of the Naval history of the United States.—” Here was another source of enquiry opened, which induced me to postpone the answer to Mr Hazard for the present. Charles went to Boston and returned for dinner. He spent part of the Evening with us but the rain prevented his wife from coming— Among the Letters that I received was one from W. W. Sifford at Lancaster Ohio, requesting my autograph for a young Lady of that place named Warner.— This fashion of gathering autographs and scraps for Albums, has become one of the ridicules of the present age in this Country— The Lecture Mania is yet more annoying— Notwithstanding the notification published in the National Intelligence the day that I left the City of Washington, not a day passes but I receive invitations to deliver Lectures.

It is unimaginable how an absence from home of a single night discomposes the whole system of my occupations and how a search for a single paper absorbs the useful labours of a day. The Night of Saturday passed in Boston, has thrown my diary three days in arrear, and will take me three days to bring it up— Louisa C. Smith went into Boston this morning— Mr Jonathan Baxter junr. Secretary of the Quincy Lyceum brought me a member’s ticket for the Season, and two tickets for a lady or a lad under 16. years of age— I received from Mr W. S. Smith a packet containing the key of the black leather trunk, which I had last sent him. He had made out to lock the trunk with the other. This afternoon, four gentlemen met here at the same time. Two of them from Milton, Mr Rowe and Mr Robbins—the other two from Lynn—Mr Oliver and Mr Newhall.— Both deputations from the Lyceums of those places to request me to deliver Lectures at each of them— I have not firmness to resist these personal applications, and have some difficulty in suppressing the temptation to answer rudely, which would be inexcusable— One of the applications which I received last Friday was from Walterman Thomas, Bourne Thomas, Luther Rogers, Charles W. Macomber, Daniel Phillips, Edward P Little and John Tilden, a Committee from the town of Marshfield, for the improvement of North River— Their invitation is that I would visit Marshfield, and going with many of their Townsmen to the spot where they wish to operate— And they specially desire this on account of my visit two years ago to Scituate.— They further propose to me to meet their citizens in some house of Public Worship during my visit to Marshfield for the interchangement of friendly feelings, and that their children may have an opportunity to look upon the man whose name is so closely connected with the honour and prosperity of their country— This is a matter of public business, interesting extensively to the inhabitants of several Towns in the 12th. Congressional District, and which of course forbids my declining the invitation to visit the spot— And being there I cannot decently refuse to go with them to the Meeting house— But there is competition between Marshfield and Scituate for the location of the canal— A Speech, in the Meeting house will be indispensable; and then what town in the District will not be entitled to a visit, a convocation in the Meeting house and a speech? I told the Gentlemen of Milton and Lynn that I could make no positive engagement but if I could make an opportunity to lecture for them would do it and give them seasonable notice— Charles and his wife spent this Evening here— I read a few of my fathers Letters.

Smith came back with him— Mr Beale came in to enquire, if I was going to attend the Cattle show at Worcester to-morrow.— I had declined— He said he proposed to go, early to-morrow morning and expected to return to-morrow evening— I redeemed the immediate arrears of my Diary, but could accomplish nothing more, except answering Mr Hazard’s Letter, to send him a copy of Govr. Langdon’s answer to my father’s Letter of 24. Jany 1813.— Mr Kirkland Lathrop, Minister of the Brattle-street Church was here this afternoon— He spoke of the trial of Alexander M’Leod, at Utica in the State of New-York; before judge Greely, of the Supreme Court of that State, and a jury; for the murder of a man named Durfee, and the burning of the Steamboat Caroline in the night of the 29th. and 30th. of December 1837.—This trial, which commenced on Monday the 4th. of this Month continued through the last week, and is probably not yet concluded— All the Newspapers have been full of reports of the progress of the trial; which involves at once a question of Peace and War with Great-Britain, and of civil War, and the existence of the Union between the General Government, and the Government of the State of New-York— This is one of the consequences naturally flowing from the Jeffersonian doctrine of nullification, and of State rights— And that doctrine had its origin in that root of all evil Slavery— This in the case of M’Leod, and the burning of the Caroline is complicated with the convulsive condition of Canada, the fermenting spirit of insurrection against the British Government in that Country—the sympathies and antipathies, always existing between the bordering population of rival nations, and the reckless spirit of adventure, avarice and ambition burning in the bosoms of multitudes, especially of young men, having little or nothing to lose, and in imagination every thing to gain by war and confusion— Mr Lathrop spoke of a Letter from Mr Roebuck to Captain Napier, and of his answer dated in August last in England, and republished here in the New-York Herald— They discuss the question of collision between our general Government, and that of the State of New-York, where by the Government of the United States, though admitting the obligation to release M’Leod, from the time when the British Government avowed the act of burning the Caroline as their own, have yet been disabled from effecting his release by the refusal of the Government of New-York to deliver him up—whence Mr Lathrop says, Captain Napier gravely concludes, that there must be War, whether M’Leod shall be finally released or not— A military conclusion— We all took tea and spent the Evening at Charles’s on the hill.

Greenleaf’s wharf for smelts— Mr Morton is a young lawyer, about two years settled in this town— He came this morning with my Note of 160.80. to John Leary, Administrator of his brother Jeremy, and the Note of John Kirk to Jeremy, both which John Leary, left with him on leaving this town, to return to Ireland, which he did about a week before I returned from Washington. I shewed Mr Morton the Letters from Mr Lewis, and from Michael Leary, intreating me to remit Jeremy’s property to Ireland for his father and mother, and not to trust it to the hands of John Leary, and I mentioned to him that I had signed John Leary’s administration bond in the probate Court at Washington.— I said I thought the best thing for me to do, was to write to Michael Leary, and authorize him to draw upon me for the amount of the two notes, sending with the Bills an order from John Leary upon Mr Morton to deliver the notes to me. With this course Mr Morton declared himself satisfied— Passed Midshipman Joseph H. Adams was here this morning—and again with his sister Elizabeth, this evening. Mr Young, the Architect of the custom house at Boston came, and said he had been informed that I had visited that building last Saturday, and he regretted that he happened not to have been there at the time. He invited me to come again, and I should almost always find him there except between two and three O’Clock afternoon. He said he should be very glad to shew me the interior arrangements of the building.— He added that there would be needed a further appropriation next winter, and they would want the assistance of their friends— Mr Young told me that the contracts for Quincy granite for the Boston Custom-house, amounted to between 80, and 90,000 dollars— He also told me that the expence of building in granite was more than double that of marble.— But he said granite was proportionally more durable— It is scarcely conceivable to me how day after day of my time wastes away, without leaving a trace behind— I had promised to deliver this Evening a Lecture before the Quincy Lyceum— After some propensity to discourse upon a topic, involving controversial politics, I finally determined to repeat the lecture upon Society and civilization— I have had a cold, hoarseness and sore throat, coming upon me these two days; I was not a little apprehensive that I should slump through in the performance, and seriously thought of sending an apology and asking a postponement.— The uneasiness of indecision, disqualified me for labour this afternoon, but I got comfortably through the delivery of the Lecture. The Revd. William M. Cornell is this year President of the Lyceum, and Justin Spear Secretary— After the Lecture the Constitution and By-Laws of the Lyceum were read.— I got home with the 9 O’Clock bell. "

Thursday  Sun rose 5:30 and set 5.30—  I went up the hill to see the Sun rise; the sky was clear, except a long thick range of black cloud on the border of the Southeastern horizon from which about 5 minutes after rising, the Sun emerged— A cold Northwest wind, and sharp white frost. Mr Clother Gifford came to me, as a phrenologist, and proposed to give my head a scientific phrenological examination, which I declined; regarding the whole pretended Science as a mischievous humbug, with all the evil tendencies of fortunetelling— I did not say so to Mr Gifford, but merely declined submitting my head to his examination.— He intimated to me, that he was a highly distinguished abolitionist, and supporter of the right of petition— Mr Brigham brought with him a young man named Hill, who came to ask my advice upon a project to set up in Boston a new whig daily Newspaper for a subscription of 3 dollars a year payable in cash upon the model of the New-York Tribune of which he brought with him and shewed me a number.— He thought the Atlas, lately considered as the Oracle of the whig party, and specially devoted to Mr Webster, since the death of its former editor Haughton, had ceased to walk straight and had lost much of the confidence of the whigs— Mr Hill said the object of his paper would be, to sustain the course of Mr Webster; and also the course of Mr Cushing— I said that was more than I could do— For that I entirely disapproved of Mr Cushing’s recent address to his Constituents— Nor in advising Mr Webster to retain his Office, would I blame his Colleagues, or any one of them for resigning theirs.— Nor has it for a moment been my intention to approve of Mr Tylers vetoes, or of any part of his conduct throughout this controversy— As to the establishment of a new daily whig newspars in Boston where there are already three such papers with wide circulation, I was not sufficiently acquainted with the present condition of Boston to advise whether such a measure is expedient or not. My son could give him better council upon that question than I could— If Mr Hill should undertake it, I would cheerfully give him any suitable assistance in my power to carry it on— Mr Minott Thayer, and Dr Storrs’s son called here— Mr Thayer clings to the idea of a call upon me by the three towns of Braintree Quincy and Randolph, for an historical address concerning the town of Braintree; which I was yet willing to undertake if the three towns should desire it— Joseph H. Adams dined with us— Charles and his wife at eve. "

This morning the Sun rose perfectly clear at 6.32, as I observed from the S.E. corner of Charles’s house— Sharp white frost; but the wind got round to S.W. before Noon— Moderate Showers and a milder atmosphere followed.— I have a very severe turn of my catarrhal cough, with hoarseness and sore throat, grievously aggravated by my persisting to Lecture last Wednesday Evening.— I had a restless and almost sleepless night, and rose this morning with a feverish head-ache, and a dejected Spirit— I took a note from Harriet Welsh up to Mrs Charles, but her cook-maid told me she was gone to Weymouth which was a mistake She and Charles were here this Evening. He had been this morning to Boston, and returned home to dine— My library and house are choked up with pamphlets, newspapers and voucher papers public and private—all in such disorder that a search for any one book, paper or document is almost without exception an irretrievable waste of time— I spend now hour after hour of almost every day in fruitless search for papers none of which I can find. The only alleviation for this is that I sometimes find what I am not looking for, but which I want as much as I do the object of my search. In hunting over this day the pamphlets in one of my closets, I found a number of packages of the Returns of Commerce and Navigation, from 30. September 1838 to 1839. reported to Congress 1. July 1840. but not printed and received here till last May, when in the very few days that I spent here, I had no time to direct them to the proper persons— I left them here therefore, and thought no more about them, till on rummaging over the closet, the last two or three days, I find them encumbering the shelves. I have also multitudes of my own Orations, Addresses, Eulogies and other pamphlets, for want of having distributed, when they were fresh and readable, have now got to be classed with old lumber, and with which I know not what to do— This confusion in my library, leaves me no time for my necessary correspondence, and I receive great numbers of Letters which I never answer. We have this day the account that on the trial of Alexander M’Leod at Utica, in the State of New-York, for the murder of Durfee, in December 1837. at the destruction of the Steamboat Caroline, the verdict of the jury pronounced him not guilty, and he was immediately discharged— This relieves us from all immediate danger of hostile collision with Great-Britain, but leaves the Negotiations with that Country upon the Maine boundary, the South-Sea boundary; the Slave-trade, and the seizures of our vessels on the coast of Africa, thorns to be extracted by purer and more skiful hands than are to be found in the administration of John Tyler.

Another uninterrupted and wasted day: my catarrhal cough continuing with unabated severity, although the sore throat and hoarseness have almost entirely subsided— I hear my two Granddaughters read. Mary-Louisa in the French Bible five verses at a time, which Louisa-Catherine and I alternately, immediately read over again in the English Bible. Mary-Louisa continues her study of Fenning’s Algebra, and reads and translates from Berquins dialogues— They are also reading La Fontaine’s fables, and Moliere’s comedies in French, and the Vicar of Wakefield and Rasselas in English— I hope and pray that the time which I devote to these children, and especially to the fatherless daughter of my dear Son John may not be lost— A large portion of the day was again consumed in searching in vain for papers, through a chaos, which will never be brought into order— I received this morning a packet from Washington containing four copies of the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury with the Returns of Commerce and Navigation for the year ending 30. Septr. 1840— This report, sent into Congress on the third day of last March, the expiring day of the 26th. Congress, is now after nearly eight months first sent to the members of that Congress, in print— I reserved one for myself, one for Charles and despatched one to Samuel T. Armstrong at Boston, and one to Nathaniel M Davis at Plymouth— I despatched also several of the document of the last year, and answered Letters of invitation from Isaac T. Smith at New-York, and George W. Warren at Charlestown, to deliver Lyceum Lectures which I decline. Mr Lunt was here this afternoon, but I was on the hill, witnessing his labours in blasting rocks and building a stone wall as durable as the pyramids— Charles and his wife, were here an hour or two this evening; and Miss Samson the seamstress who has been here at work these three days left us and returned to her home at Braintree. The Acadia Steamer departed from Boston this morning for Liverpool— The storm of the 3d. and 4th. of this month was a severe trial of the safety of this boat, and also of the Caledonia— They were crossing each other between Boston and Halifax— The Acadia lay to 21. hours and took no damage— The Caledonia lay to 52 hours—lost her life-boat, and suffered other injury— One man on board had a limb broken— Mr Cunard has contracted with the British Government, to add two more boats to this line of packets, and to start them once a week.— This together with the western railroad, which is to be opened to Albany on the first of next December, and which brings Albany almost as near to Boston as to New-York is of great promise to the prospects of Boston.

                "text": "17. IV. Sunday  Mr Lothrop, minister of the Church in Brattle square, Boston, but who has a Summer residence on Milton-hill preached here at the Temple, this morning from Psalm 4.6. “There be many that say, who will show us any good?” The Discourse was a system of optimism— It began by asserting that the transcendent Wisdom of Solomon sometimes deserted him; and this was particularly exemplified in the gloomy pictures and sentiments scattered over the book of Ecclesiastes. Mr Lothrop thinks that all is not vanity, and that the physical and the moral world, are full of good things, which it is the duty of man to enjoy, with gratitude and praise to God who gave them— It is certain that the holy Scriptures declare that the Creator himself saw that his whole creation was good.— The doctrine of the Jewish Religion in the age of Solomon, and that of the Christian religion now is that all this good, was forfeited to man by his apostasy, and that from that day the earth was accursed for his sake. The goodness of God is celebrated with transcendent raptures of many of the Psalms of David, but others are plaintive and indignant against the wicked— Mr Lothrop however enumerated many sources of good, enjoyed by man, and exemplified it by many benevolent and some pathetic illustrations—the beauties of nature, the fulfilment of the duties of life,—the effusions of family affections, the exercise of mutual good offices, works of charity, in addition to all the prosperities which contribute to the comfort and happiness of men, are all good; and all to be acknowledged as good— I have myself often thought that a comparison between the youth and old age of Solomon, and of Louis 14. would explain much of the Book of Ecclesiastes— Excessive prosperity and especially great ostentation of magnificence, overstrain the capacities of the human frame for enjoyment— Mr Lothrop, and Charles, who was his Classmate at Cambridge dined with us— The afternoon Sermon was from 1. Corinthians 1.24 “Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.”— In the text this is applied specially to Christ crucified, the stumbling block to the Jews and the foolishness to the Greeks— The reference is to the doctrine of the resurrection— Mr Lothrop however considered the word Christ in this passage as comprehending in its meaning the Christian religion, and embracing the whole power and wisdom of God— The discourse was not so impressive as that of the morning, but Mr Lothrop has paid great attention to the polish of his style. His composition is elegant.— Returning from Meeting this afternoon, I found Archibald Campbell and Isaac Hull Adams, at our house— They are engineers, and employed on the construction of railroads. Campbell’s is but a flying visits, and he departs to-morrow— Joseph H. Adams passed midshipman has received orders to go to Washington for some supervision of the depot of Maps and Charts. In my reading I draw towards the close of the two published volumes of my father’s Letters—and I am reading over Mr Lunt’s two centennial Discourses on the Braintree Church. "

Mr Rand belongs to Milton, and resides on the edge of the town next to Quincy— He came this morning in company with Dr Duggan, and invited me to deliver a Lecture before the Milton and Quincy Lyceum. I received and declined the same invitation two years ago, and then made a conditional promise, to Lecture at some future time if I conveniently could— I now declined, from incapacity, under my catarrhal cough, which gives no sign of approaching departure— The morning was fine with promise of a fair day—but clouds gathered all the morning and blew up in the afternoon a long squall of successive hail snow and rain in the midst of which a knock at my eastern door brought me to open it for an elderly man shivering with cold, and drenched with the shower, with a carpet bag in one hand a long staff in the other and a pair of old saddle-bags over the other— I invited him into the parlour where for the space of three quarters of an hour he warmed and dried himself, and then told me that his name was Thomas Williams—that he was a clergyman born at Pomfret in Connecticut; had resided in various places—many years at Providence; and now lived at East Greenwich in the State of Rhode-Island; and that he called upon me to make certain enquiries— In the meantime Mr Gilman Davis came in from Boston with his Son whom he introduced to me, and a very warm recommendatory Letter from Coll. Josiah Quincy junr— More than a year ago Mr Davis applied to Mr Paulding then Secretary of the Navy, for a Midshipman’s warrant for his Son who has an overpowering passion to enter the Navy. With the application he forwarded urgent recommendations from Marcus Morton, George Bancroft, Postmaster Green Rantoul and the like— The answer was that his name was on the roll of applicants at the Department—but little encouragement, and multitudes of applications— Upon the change of administration the application was renewed with a recommendation from Coll. Quincy, to Daniel Webster The complaint is that 50 new Midshipmen have received warrants and Davis has been overlooked. The father said he was going to Washington himself to look to it; and he wanted me to give him a recommendatory Letter, which having no acquaintance with the Secretary of the Navy Upshur, I declined, but said I would cheerfully give any aid in my power to obtain for the young man the warrant— Mr Clark brought me a tax bill from Milton, for the penny-ferry 3 acre lot of salt marsh, valued at 200 dollars. Mr Williams gave me his funeral discourse on the character of Dr. Emmons: his enquiries were concerning abolition, free masonry, secret Societies, Voltaire, Weishaupt and the like; including the seventh vial of the apocalypse. Mr. G. W. Beale and his daughter Anne here this evening. "

I had received yesterday an invitation from President Quincy to attend the exhibition at Cambridge this day; but as it did not appear that as a member of the board of Overseers, I had been chosen upon any Committee this year to visit the University, as I could not go without much inconvenience and loss of at least one day, I concluded not to go. Mr Worthington and Mr M’Mullen came as a deputation from the young men’s association at Albany, to repeat an invitation, more than once heretofore given to me to deliver a Lecture before them. They brought with them commendatory Letters from Governor Seward, from Tunis Van Vechten, Mayor of Albany, and from Dr J. N. Campbell, the Clergyman heretofore Minister of the second presbyterian church at Washington. My catarrhal cough continues without any symptom of abatement, but on the contrary with evident aggravation— I was therefore compelled again to decline this invitation with a promise that if the cough should leave me, and I find it practicable I will yet return to Washington by the way of Albany, and deliver the lecture there. I had much political conversation with these two young men, and spoke my mind with more freedom than prudence— The worst consequence of these importunities, is their effect upon me as flattery. I am so tickled with professions of veneration that I believe them all sincere. It might be wiser to treat them all with contempt. But it would not be so good natured— A man by the name of Benjamin Parsons came with a subscription paper for a second much enlarged edition of a very shallow unitarion volume or pamphlet of whiche sent me a copy last winter or Spring— He called upon me afterwards to explain his system to me— But I had entirely forgotten him, and I declined subscribing to his second edition— He fancies himself a first rate theologian, and has letters from Elliot of St. Louis, and from another yankee divine at Louisville assuring him that his work has been very extensively read and has done an immensity of good, in and about those regions, and urging him fervently to publish his projected new edition— I continue my search for papers without finding any of those that I want. I took up again this day my commentary upon Mr Grace’s heraldry and genealogies, but was so much interrupted that I could make no progress— I finished reading the two volumes of my father’s Letters published by my Son, which have deeply affected me, by the reminiscences that they carry through with them— There are some that I had not read before.

It was two years last August since the last Meeting that I had attended; and there had been but one Meeting since; which was at Boston, on the 16th. of last April.— President Quincy was now absent, probably detained by the foul weather, a rainy day having succeeded to a clear morning; and Mr Miller, whose health is infirm, sent an excuse for that reason— Mr Greenleaf, Mr Beale, and myself were the only members of the board present, with my Son as Secretary— Mr Greenleaf presented a report of a Committee on the accounts of the late Treasurer Noah Curtis, who was also the Town Treasurer, and of their transfer to the present Treasurer, also of both Town and Temple Corporation— There is upwards of 1500 dollars in the hands of the Treasurer—chiefly consisting of Notes from the Town of Quincy.— The present Treasurer is George Nightingale.— Several votes were passed—with the view to leasing house-lots, on the Hancock, Babel and centre rock pastures, and to opening the Street through the centre of the Hancock lot— Captain Underwood has purchased the corner house lot on which the dwelling house stands; and there has been some expectation that the town, would finally fix their new town house there To this however I do not myself incline, and would prefer that the town, should in no case stand in the relation of a debtor to the corporation. The Members of the board, and Mr Lunt, with Charles and his wife dined with us, but about an hour before dinner Mr Luther Rogers one of the Committee men from North Marshfield came in with a Letter from Daniel Phillips about the arrangements for my visit next Thursday to Marshfield— They now propose to me to stay there over night and to make it an affair of two days— This is double double toil and trouble, but I must submit my neck to the yoke— Mr Rogers has a son named Clift Rogers, residing in this town, with whom I agreed to go, so as to be on the ground at Marshfield, between 9 and 10 O’Clock on Thursday morning— This Evening a young man from Plymouth named Francis Le Baron, came with a Letter of recommendation from Mr Solomon Lincoln— Mr Le Baron declares himself about 17. years of age, and is extremely desirous of obtaining a warrant of Cadet, at the Military Academy at West Point— I told him the rules of the War Department respecting the bestowal of warrants, and the fact of young Wood’s admission this year, as the Cadet from the 12th. Congressional district; and that his only possible chances of admission were the contingency of Wood’s resigning, and a change of the District under the next apportionment. "

                "text": "21. IV. Thursday.  Every morning when clear I see Charles’s Wain as perpendicular to the horizon, and I have been several mornings watching to see the rising of Arcturus. This morning for the first time this Season I saw him about ten minutes risen, just over the spot whence the Sun rises at the Summer solstice—he was barely perceptible in the midst of the morning twilight— I have finished reading Mr Lunt’s two centennial Sermons with the Appendix, from which I have collected several interesting facts, upon which I wish I had time to meditate. They ascertain the date of the second marriage of my bisaieul John Quincy’s mother, widow of Daniel Quincy, with the Revd. Moses Fiske and those of his and of her death.— A man by the name of George Gregory came this morning and asked me to subscribe for the republication of a small pamphlet on a disgusting subject— Under strong temptation to insult him I made out civilly to decline— My wife, with Mrs John Adams and Elizabeth C. Adams went to Boston, and returned with Harriet Welsh before dinner, that is just before four O’Clock afternoon. While they were gone, about 1. O’Clock came in Christopher Hughes our Chargé d’Affaires at Stockholm, not two hours landed from the royal packet Steamer Columbia, which came in this morning with 109 passengers having left Liverpool on the 5th. of this month, and accomplished her passage against head winds and heavy gales, in 16 days, touching on her way 6 hours at Halifax. Hughes comes home, on a leave of absence for the winter, and he rattled away for two hours without intermission—but could not stay to dine with us, having engaged to return to Boston to dine with Harrison Gray Otis. He left with me a budget of Notes and Letters of mere civility from the Duke of Sussex, and sundry other Lords and Ladies, nouveaux parvenus not in rank, but in the rolling ball of time since I last left Europe. I scarcely knew one of them by name.— Immediately after Hughes came in E. Hussey, a Quaker, and J. M. Sargent, Curators of the old Lyceum at Lynn—with a recommendatory Letter from Ellis Gray Loring—to invite me to deliver a Lecture before that institution—not the same with that from which Mr Oliver and Mr Newell came last week— I excused myself upon the plea of my cough, though they would hardly take no for an answer— They remained, closely listening to all Hughes’s humours, with which they were much entertained— Charles Welsh, Miss Harriet’s nephew, eldest son of her brother Thomas followed her out here upon some pursuit of his own, but returned immediately to Boston. Mr Lunt came in the Evening for his two daughters, who with little Mary Dawes were here, romping with our two Granddaughters— And Charles and his wife also spent the Evening here. "

                "text": "22. IV:15 Friday  A man by the name of John Rogers brought me this morning a highway tax-bill at Randolph of 21 cents assessed to the heirs of John Adams— I enquired what and where this land was upon which this assessment was made, which he could not tell, and as I knew of no such estate, I referred him to the Assessors for an explanation— I despatched sundry public documents and assorted a few papers; in preparation for Letter writing this afternoon— I received by a special messenger a card from Mr Harrison Gray Otis, with a note inviting me to dinner to morrow at 5 to meet Lord Morpeth, which I accepted.— Charles went to Boston, and returned home to dine— We at our house had barely risen from table when Mr Samuel T. Armstrong came in on a visit from Boston— This Gentleman was a bookseller of Bibles and school books, in which business he is said to have made a large fortune— In the year 1833 when the Antimasons thought proper to nominate me for the Office of Governor of the State, and the federalists and Masons set up John Davis against me, they wanted a mechanic a Bostonian and an orthodox calvinist church member for Lieutenant Governor and their convention at Worcester selected Armstrong— About that time I first became acquainted with him, by meeting him at dinner at Dr. George Parkman’s, and from that time there has been a very kind, and friendly intercourse between us.— In 1835 when to keep me out of the U.S. Senate “honest John[”] Davis was chosen, Armstrong became acting Governor for the year, but when the election for the next year came Armstrong no longer suited the party.— They took Edward Everett for Governor; and he being a Bostonian Unitarian, they chose George Hull of Sandisfield a western Calvinist for Lieutenant Governor, and eased off Mr Armstrong, by making him for one year Mayor of Boston: after which they put him two or three years on the Senatorial ticket for the County of Suffolk in the Legislature of the State and then dropped him altogether.— It was by his agency that in 1836 I was invited by the city Government of Boston to deliver the Eulogy upon James Madison— He is a very religious man, and a good citizen— His visit was followed by that of Mr and Mrs Abbott Lawrence, with their second son Bigelow, and their youngest daughter, Catherine, and Miss Leslie their visitor from Philadelphia. Mr Lawrence is to dine to-morrow at Mr Otis’s; and they both gave me a pressing invitation to stop in the City to-morrow night at their house, which I almost accepted.— There is to be a great whig Caucus, at Faneuil-Hall next Monday Evening at which Mr Lawrence is to preside, and where Choate and Robert Winthrop are to make speeches. Mrs T. B. Adams and her daughter Elizabeth with Fanny Foster took tea, and spent the Evening with us. Whist— Mrs Foster did not come— Her son Frank arrived this day from the Isle of France—the ship in which he was coming from Calcutta, having been blown up. "

                "text": "24. V:15 Sunday.  I had yesterday morning a long second visit from the Revd. Thomas Williams, the object of which was to read to me a discourse of two hours reading upon the pouring out of the 6th. and 7th. vials of the Apocalypse. Upon Voltaire, Weishaupt, the illuminati, Professor Robison, the abbé Baruel the ΦB.K. Society Mr Jefferson, and divine judgments. After reading his book through, he asked for my opinion upon the subjects discussed in it— I told him that the Book of Revelation was to me profoundly mysterious, and I had never seen any explanation of it as prophesy, satisfactory to my mind— That I doubted whether it ever had been correctly explained, and that I was therefore not competent to pronounce upon the soundness of his speculations.— The man has every other appearance of a sober intelligent modest consciencious minister of the gospel— He is one of a class who may pass by the general denomination of apocolyptic monomaniacs.— This morning Mr Lunt preached from John 9.25. [“]He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not; one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.” Mr Lunt according to his usual manner read the whole chapter whence he took his text, and expounded the narrative of the restoration of sight to the blind man, on the Sabbath day. The questions by the disciples whether the man was born blind, for any sin of his own or of his parents received an answer of universal application, that natural physical infirmities, are not to be considered as inflicted in punishment for sin— A moral principle of great importance— But from the remainder of the answer, Jesus seems to say that the blindness of that particular individual, was preordained to furnish the occasion for the performance of a miracle by him, by giving sight to the blind. There is something remarkable in the manner of performing this miracle, which was noticed by Mr Lunt, but without much comment— The pharisees took exception to it as a violation of the Sabbath; and the Jews instead of being converted to faith were exasperated against all who were and had proscribed from the Synagogue everyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ— Mr Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from Revelation 12.1. “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven: a woman clothed with the Sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars—” The text was used only as introductory to a discourse upon the character of the Apocalypse, as one of the canonical books of the holy Scriptures. Mr Lunt considers it merely as an allegorical representation of the calamitous and persecuted condition of the Church in the early part of its struggles with the Jewish and heathen world— The woman, the Dragon, Michael and his angels, and the wars in heaven he viewed as the mere personifications of the conflict between the spirit of good and the spirit of evil— Mr Lunt is not disposed to add mystification to mystery.  Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us. "

Monday  This was the anniversary of my father’s marriage in 1764. a day never to be forgotten by me; and never remembered but with an effusion from the heart of gratitude to God. On rising this morning I was surprized by the appearance of a splendid Northern light—the first that I remember ever to have seen in the morning.— At 5. Arcturus rose above the horizon, and at 6.46. the Sun, which I saw from Charles’s house with Fahrenheit at 32. Mr John Minott an ex-inspector of the customs, dismissed from Office by the new Collector at Boston, Governor Lincoln, for political sins came and kept me two hours on tenterhooks with a confused detail of his own history for many years, so disjointed and ill adjusted that I could make of it neither head nor tail— The substance of it was, that he wanted my influence to obtain from Governor Lincoln a restoration to the office of inspector of the customs— I told him I had no more influence for that purpose than one of the pillars of the building.— Minott Thayer had applied for permission to Genl. Miller to appoint this John Minot an inspector at Salem, and had written to me that he had obtained it— But that it seems was a mistake. General Miller only had leave to appoint him in case of a vacancy; and there is none— This was a facheux. Isaac Hull Adams came to take leave, going to-morrow to Hartford where he is engaged to assist in making maps of the surveys of the North-eastern boundary which have been made under the separate authority of the Government of the United States— Mr Clift Rogers son of Luther Rogers of Marshfield came this Afternoon, and agreed to come with a horse and Chaise, to take me at half past 5 O’Clock next Thursday morning, for my visit to Marshfield.— He left with me a large hand-bill Notice, dated Marshfield 22. October, and signed by Daniel Phillips, Luther Rogers E. P. Little, and Luther Hatch—containing a programme of my movements on that day—including a boating party to the beach—a dinner at Mr Luther Rogers, and an interview with the citizens of that vicinity in the episcopal church at 3. p.m.—I agreed to be ready to start with Mr Clift Rogers at half past 5—on Thursday morning, with fair weather or the promise of it—and if not that day, the next or the next— Our Ladies, except my wife, who was unwell, took tea, and spent the Evening at Mrs T. B. Adams’s. I went there my self at 8. and spent an hour, found Charles and his wife there. Mrs Foster and her son Frank— No Strangers— I walked home with Charles—pinching cold— I finished regularly reading throughWheelock’s folio Newspaper Dissertation upon Marriage and Divorce. The whole substance of the Argument is that there can be no lawful marriage without conjugal affection and that all others are null and void. "

Sun rose 6.47. clear  The first object that struck my eye on entering my Library this morning was Arcturus, about 10 minutes risen— The Thermometer on the South side of the house was at 20 just before Sunrise, and the same at Charles’s house where I witnessed the rising of the Sun— I never witnessed here the thermometer so low so early in the Season. A man by the name of Charles Simmons came, and after accosting me with a nauseous compliment proposed to me to subscribe to a new edition of the works of Dr Nathaniel Emmons, the last pillar of the Orthodox protestant church in six Octavo volumes at two dollars a volume, which I declined.— My Son went to Boston, and returned home to dine— Harriet Welsh went with him, having paid us a visit of 6. days— Amidst the distractions of an attempt even partially to overhaul and assort my pamphlets and papers, I am losing all trace of the arrears of my correspondence. I have been nearly six Months brooding over Mr Grace’s genealogical Letter and dissertation upon the families of Quincy and Adams— And some weeks have passed away since I began writing in the form of a Letter some remarks upon them— I finished the work this morning, by a sort of convulsive exertion, and after dinner I took it with my Letter-book to Charles’s house to be copied. I had received a Letter from Mrs Hammett of Bangor, informing me that she had sent to Mr William Simmons in Boston a packet of my mother’s Letters to Mrs Cushing wife of the late judge William Cushing of Scituate.— Mrs Hammett who is a niece of Mrs Cushing had spoken to me at Bangor of these Letters, and had promised to let me have an opportunity to peruse them. Charles brought the packet containing them from Boston; and I read them all this Evening.— They are twenty-four in number, with part of one more. Their dates are from 4. April 1800 to 15. May 1814. and relate chiefly to invitations of mutual visiting, between Scituate and Quincy; obituaries of common friends, and allusions to the most prominent political incidents of the times as they successively occurred. Mrs Cushing was not a familiar acquaintance of my mother’s early life— The first Letter of this collection was written in the last year of my father’s Presidency. Mr Cushing had succeeded his father as one of the Judges of the Superior Court of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, he was the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a place which my father had declined— At the first organization of the Courts of the United States, Mr Cushing was transferred from the State Bench of Massachusetts and appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, which station he held until his death, in September 1810. One of these Letters is of condolence upon his decease. "

I sent this morning into Boston, a box of Documents and papers to be ship’d for Washington, by the brig Columbia, Enos Kent master, and Mr Carr received and brought out the box and trunk received by the same vesselMarston master, which sailed from Alexandria on the 16th. and arrived at Boston last Sunday the 24th.— Mr Lunt called here this morning with MrHedge of Plymouth, who has a Son for whom he wishes to obtain a warrant of admission as a Cadet at the Military Academy at West-Point.— I stated to him the fact of the admission of Wood as the Cadet from the 12th. Congressional district of Massachusetts, but offered to make application if Mr Hedge desired it for his son, and to have his name entered on the book of the War Department as a candidate— He did not declare his determination— Peter Mackintosh, a claimant 84 years old, of a pension for military service in the Revolutionary War, came with Ephraim Marsh, to enquire for papers relating to the claim, which they say I presented at the War Department, and which the Commissioner of Pensions states in writing being found insufficient were returned to me— Of all which I have no distinct recollection, and know not where to look for the papers if I have them.— Mackintosh’s own memory is so far gone, that he could not tell me how long it was since I presented his claim and he forgot to bring with him, a Letter which he had received from me. I promised to look up his papers and vouchers if I can find them— Mr Watson came to enquire if he could obtain a Midshipman’s warrant for his son for bearing his own name— Mr Watson himself was an officer in the army during the last War with Great-Britain, and has since been in the custom-house, from which he was removed by David Henshaw, for his political preferences, and to which he has not been successful in soliciting a restoration— Mr Watson says his father was of the army during the War of Independence— Mr Harrison Gray Otis, with his daughter Mrs Ritchie, and a small boy, a child of his son William came also out of Boston, and paid us a morning visit— These attentions, and the invitation to the late dinner, are tenders of reconciliation, which I am bound to meet in the same Spirit— Otis has withdrawn from all the pursuits of worldly ambition, but adheres yet to those of Fortune in which he has been more successful— My wife took tea at Charles’s, and I followed her there and spent an hour with them. After which we all came down together for the remainder of the Evening. Their daughter Louisa Catherine is afflicted with an inflammation of the face, which confines her to the house— "

I return to my habitual occupations, but with the aggravated pressure of two days of life to record, and with proportional inability to accomplish any thing else— I opened my black leather Portmanteau trunk just received from Washington, and found it filled with files of Letters of the last and present years, and a great increase of old pamphlets and newspapers to be assorted, if ever I should have time to undertake it— Now it is utterly impossible— I am endeavouring only to collect the superfluous copies of my own publications, of which I have almost enough to stock a booksellers shop, and to pack them in one or two chests or boxes, for as many of them as I now have, I scarcely know where to look for any particular one, when as not unfrequently happens I receive a Letter from a stranger requesting a copy of any one of them— While I find it impossible to arrange my own papers my wife and my son are arranging and assorting the papers of my father— I received last Monday a Letter from George Bancroft mentioning that he had seen a Letter from James Warren of Plymouth in which he says he had written to my father an account of the Battle of Bunker hill—and if such a documents exists, Mr Bancroft requests a sight of it— He says he has other curious revolutionary papers, bearing testimony of my father’s merits and services. Bancroft professes too much desire to do honour and justice to my father.— I distrust him— The principles of his history are in direct collision with those to which my father adhered through life, and whatever of approbation he may affect to bestow upon my father, will only be to cover some insidious attack upon his memory.— Charles found the Letter from General Warren which Mr Bancroft desires to see, and sent it to him— This afternoon Mr Barrett, and Mrs Sarah Weld, son and daughter of Mr John Barrett once an inhabitant of this town, but many years since deceased came out from Boston Mrs Weld, whose husband is a grand son of Mr Weld who was many years Minister of the congregational church at Braintree has a son nineteen years of age for whom she is desirous of obtaining a Warrant of Cadet at the Military Academy of West point.— Her husband wrote to me last Spring upon this subject, and I had the young man’s name entered as a Candidate for admission, but I was obliged to tell Mrs Weld that the chances for her son, at his age are very slender for success— Mr Barrett is the teacher of a school in Boston. Ruth Turner was here at work, and Charles and his wife spent the Evening here— Among my occupations, is that of writing lines for the Album of Fanny Foster, which has worried me for several days past.— Charles went to Boston, and returned to dine— My only excursion from the house this day, was up the hill this afternoon.

Saturday  It is mortifying to reflect upon the precious time which I suffer to be absorbed in responding to applications for autographs and signatures with Sentiments in Albums, Lectures, Orations and Addresses.— Mrs Phineas Foster’s daughter, a modest, lovely child, just entering upon her teens, sent me a few days since a blank Album with a request that I would write my name and a few lines in it— The lines have been breeding in my brain Night and Morning several days, till this morning, when I wrote them in the book. I finished also a Letter long since begun, to my niece, my Sister’s daughter, Mrs Caroline Amelia De Windt of Cedar grove, Fishkill landing New-York, who has published a volume of my Sister’s journal and correspondence, with a Memoir of the life of her husband, Colonel William Stephens Smith; as a sort of Supplement to the four volumes of my father’s and mother’s Letters, published by my Son— Mrs De Windt has dedicated her book to me—and it is ornamented with two engravings; one from the Portrait of my Sister painted by Copley, which I gave to my Mother, and after her decease, at her desire, to Mrs De Windt, and the other a view of the house in which I now write, and in which my father lived and died from a drawing by Miss Elizabeth Susan Quincy.— I send with the Letter to Mrs De Windt a copy of my Tale of Charles the 5ths. Clocks, which is related in prose from Robertson’s history, in a Letter from Coll. Smith of 30. June 1787. written at Madrid— There has been since yesterday a great change in the temperature of the atmosphere, which was this day quite warm. Mr Cornell came this morning, and repeated the invitation to me to deliver another Lecture before the Quincy Lyceum of which he is now the President. I could make no promise, but without absolutely refusing, told him I would, if I should find it practicable— My Son with his wife, daughter and three elder Sons dined with us, and he was here again in the Evening— The mildness of the weather invited me out this afternoon, and I planted many shagbark walnuts in my seminary. Towards evening I made an attempt to assort one collection of my writings and discourses in pamphlets— They will form four considerable Octavo Volumes— I would they were all, more worthy of being preserved for posterity— I continue to give lessons to my Granddaughter Mary-Louisa, and finished reading this morning in French the 2d book of Chronicles.

Yesterday and this delay belong to a different climate from that of the whole preceding part of the month and the change to warm weather brought with it to me an attack of lumbago, from which I have been for several years exempt.— Mr Lunt preached this morning from 1 Corinthians 13.13. “And now abideth Faith—Hope—Charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.—[”] All religion, and all virtue is contained in this verse.— The whole chapter is an amplification of the transcendent virtue of charity— There is something remarkable in the mode of expression—and now abideth—the verb in the singular number—Faith—Hope—Charity—each separately abideth—forever— These three—what? The apostle gives them no qualification— He calls them not virtues, or graces— He says each of them abideth— The word imports eternity. These three—what?—what of them? What figure of speech is this? What volume of declamation could equal in emphasis these few words, which embrace the whole duty of Man upon earth—but the greatest of these is charity— The greatest what? the greatest virtue—why the greatest? because it is the only active virtue. It consists in action; in doing good.— Mr Lunt observed that these three virtues corresponded with the three elementary qualities of the human character— Faith being an attribute of the Understanding—Hope of the Imagination, and Charity of the Heart; but the language of St. Paul imports that their union is indispensable to the perfection of the Christian character. The foundation of them all is Faith—active and passive— Hope is the natural result of Faith, as Charity results from the Union of Faith and Hope— For without Faith there can be no hope; and without Faith and hope no Charity— Mr Degrand came out from Boston, and dined and spent the Evening with us— Mr Lunt’s afternoon text was from 1. Corinthians 4.2. [“]Moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful,” and his doctrine was that in the spirit of Christianity, every man is a steward, or trustee, and not the proprietor of life and of every other blessing that he receives from the hand of God— He noticed the propensity of the Corinthians to divide themselves into factions, and also their proneness to vain boasting and self-sufficiency, which the apostle rebukes very severely.— This principle, that life and all its powers, blessings and enjoyments are trusts of which a strict account is to be given hereafter is one of the foundations of the Christian system of morals.— I made some enquiries of Mr Degrand respecting the number and the cost of the Railroads which within the last fifteen years have been constructed in this State— They are fourteen in number, and have cost at a rough estimate 22 millions of Dollars.— I would pursue these researches, upon a far more extensive scale, but that my remnant of life is too short— Charles here after Degrand went away.

He was an Inspector of the Customs, when I was President, and General H. A. S. Dearborn Collector at Boston— When Jackson became President, he dismissed Dearborn from the Office of Collector and appointed David Henshaw in his place— Henshaw displaced Jotham Lincoln, and appointed in his place, I know not whom— Henshaw a patriotic democrat ruled the Jackson party; filled his pockets, with the emoluments of the Collectors Office, speculated upon the Commonwealths Bank till it broke; ratted from that in time to save himself; and by the political jugglery of getting whig lawyers to settle the Accounts of the broken Commonwealth’s bank, sunk some hundreds of thousands of dollars, for the Treasury of the United States, and holds his head up like an honest man, with an investigation, in Congress, which like all other such investigations will end in smoke— When Harrison and the whigs came in, Dearborn and Jotham, and numberless others, turned out of Office by Jackson and his Satellites, expected to be restored to their Offices— All, I believe without one exception have been disappointed— Jotham is in great want of a place because he says a partner of his in trade has swindled him out of all his property, and he thinks hard of me, because he knows so little of the world as to believe that my recommendation would restore him— I have been chary of recommendations, and not one that I have made has succeeded— Mr Robbins of Milton, with Mrs Robbins called this afternoon, to repeat the invitation to me to deliver a Lecture before the Milton Lyceum— My catarrhal cough is now complicated with a touch of the lumbago— I know not how long I shall have the free use even of my limbs— Without positively declining, I told Mr Robbins I feared it would not be in my power to lecture again this Season— Mr Robbins is a Son of the late Edward Hutchinson Robbins, sometime Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth. Afterwards Lieutenant Governor, and at last judge of probate for the County of Norfolk.— Mr Robbins is, or rather has been for the present year a Senator for the County in the State Legislature. He is now a candidate for re-election, but without prospect of success— The weather was this day so warm, that I had no fire in my chamber— I planted some shagbark nuts and Acorns in the Seminary. Wasted great part of the day in unsorting and assorting pamphlets and papers, and the range of my exercise, was a visit to my son’s house on the hill. He was here this evening "

It is impossible for me to enumerate or to foresee the calls upon my time from breakfast for the remainder of the day. I completed within four lines my record of yesterday before breakfast; and then by calls of five or ten minutes at a time ran down the morning so that I barely could finish the page before dinner.— I was desirous of referring to a congressional document of the Session of 1829 and 30. and had a search for it of at least two hours at the farm house, without success— But in a fruitless search for one thing I sometimes find another— I had been wanting to look into a small volume of poems of Parnell, without knowing where to find it. This time it fell under my hands, as I was seeking for public documents— I found the words which had remained many years on my memory— My impression was that they were Prior’s—but they are in a Letter from Arbuthnot to Parnell— My search for them was to enliven a Letter to William Cost Johnson— With no small difficulty and by borrowing an hour of the evening by lamplight— We had visits this afternoon from Dr Holbrook, and his daughter Mrs Robinson, who said she had come on purpose to see me, never having seen me before. The Doctor is 85 years of age, and until within the last few months has enjoyed very good health— He is now drooping, but still cheerful— Mrs Robinson uses an ear trumpet— Mr and Mrs John Angier were also—from Medford this morning and return thither this evening. Charles went to Boston and returned home to dinner. Mr Joseph Hardwick was here, a second time with my annual parish tax bill but I was obliged to refer him over to my Son— At evening twilight I went up the hill for a quarter of an hour, and Charles and his wife passed part of the evening here— We had nearly concluded, upon a general departure from this place the day after to-morrow— Charles and his family to take up their abode for the winter in Boston—my wife and family to proceed immediately to Washington, and I myself to pass three weeks in Boston, and then go on to attend the Session of Congress— But Charles’s wife, whose health is somewhat impaired has thoughts of going to spend the winter, or part of it with us at Washington—  Day. My daily mode of life here has been to rise between 4 and 5. and it takes me an hour to wash, dress and make my fire. When the Sun rises clear, I visit the S.E. corner of Charles’s house— Yesterday the Sun rose from that corner in a line with the Universalist Meeting house— I write, or read, Letters received by the Mail, and Newspapers till 8. then breakfast, read with my Granddaughter two Chapters in the Bible, French and English—dawdle till two—dine—dawdle till Sunset— Up the hill and down again. Eve with my family. "

Arcturus and Venus rose together with me, the fixed star gaining daily upon the planet— Part of the avocations of this day consisted of accounts and bills to be settled, before our departure. Mr Jonathan Bean of Mountville in the State of Maine came to see me, and he said for no other purpose; being in this town, merely on a visit to relatives of his own name— He was very inquisitive of my opinions especially upon political topics; and I freely gave them— I had received two Letters from Governor Seward of New-York, of great civility; one of them inviting me to lodge at his house in Albany. He had sent me copies of his Messages to the Legislature, particularly concerning his controversy with the Governors of Virginia. I had sent him a copy of my Speech in H.R.U.S. upon the case of M’Leod, in acknowledging the receipt of which, he had intimated his dissent from some of the opinions expressed in it— I had now to reply to his kindness, his courtesy and his dissent, in one Letter, and it took me half this day to write it to reciprocate benevolence without simulating or dissimulating opinion, to maintain perfect sincerity, without wounding sensibility, requires so much caution in the use of words, and in the expression of sentiment, that it takes almost as much time to write such a Letter, as to compose a dissertation. Voltaire and Jefferson in such cases wrote flattering Letters to their correspondents, and Letters, censorious of the same correspondents to others— This is the quintessence of duplicity— There is great danger of falling into this practice. There is no surer test of a double-dealer than to compare his Letters of opinion, with one another— I went with Charles this Evening to the town-Hall, where he delivered the Lecture before the Quincy Lyceum. It was a critical disquisition upon Shakespear, and a comparative analysis of his Tragedy of Hamlet, with the Electra of Sophocles and the Semiramis of Voltaire— He had delivered this Lecture, last Winter, before the Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge at Boston, and doubted whether it would be suitable to his auditory here— But the Hall was as crowded as it could hold—two thirds at least of the company being women— The lecture occupied an hour and a half, and the profoundest silence, with the most intense attention, proved the deep interest taken in it by the auditory— I read this Lecture last Spring; and there is another forming a sequel to it and containing a similar comparative analysis of Shakespear’s Macbeth, which I have not read. Charles’s estimate of Shakespear’s genius is lower than mine. There is less of enthusiasm, and more of judgment in his composition than in mine— When we returned from the Lyceum Meeting, his wife had gone home. "

My wife has concluded to postpone her departure for Washington till next Monday; and Charles moved with his family into Boston this day. We were both engaged to dine with Mr Samuel T. Armstrong, so I came with him in his Gig, and his wife and children came in afterwards in the Carriage— As I was walking from the livery-stable to Charles’s house, I met Richard H.

And in Robson’s British heraldry, a book in three quarto volumes which he has, I found the heraldic technical description of those arms, and of the Adams arms, as on my father’s seal, and of the Boylston arms, as used by him in the Seal which he affixed to the Treaties with the Netherlands, Prussia, and Morocco, and the Preliminary and definitive Treaties of Peace of 30.

Returning to Charles’s house just before we were going out to dinner Mr Lewis Tappan came in with Mr Deming of Farmington, Connecticut, with whom the Amistad Africans have since their discharge been living.— They are now in this City, and Mr Tappan renewed the invitation to me to attend and address them at a public exhibition, which I again declined.

He dined with us, and then returned to Boston— At 7 this evening I went with my wife, and my Granddaughter Mary-Louisa, to a concert at the Hancock house, by the Rainers, A German Swiss family of itinerant musicians— There were this evening four men, and one woman—dressed in the costume of their country— They sang 12 popular songs and duets, the woman accompanying with a Guitar; and two of the men, accompanied one of the songs with Zitterns— Small rooms, and a crowded auditory.

Winthrop, and Leverett Saltonstall are haranguing whig caucus-meetings throughout the State in vain to support it— The general expectation is that Marcus Morton will again be elected Governor of the Commonwealth, and that democracy will ride rough shod over the whole Country— The ambitious politicians are trimming their sails to the breeze— Webster has been spending several weeks at Marshfield, fishing, shooting, ut olim, leaving his son Fletcher to act the Secretary of State, and affecting the Stoic to the still recurring rumours that he is to be discarded, or hoisted out of his department into some foreign mission— He has avoided and evaded all conversation with Mr Lawrence upon the thorny questions of Bank, Tariff and negotiation with England, and Lawrence has lost all confidence in him— Caleb Cushing has taken a Lover’s leap over to the Tyler territory, and makes his court (fait sa cour) to the Lady Elizabeth— This as Burke says is a curious show, but unsafe to stand upon— The prospects of the Country so far as government is concerned are dismal, but its prosperity continues unabated and increasing.— God and Nature are still bountiful; but Providence as if to reserve to itself its supremacy of beneficence, and to baffle and disconcert all human exertion to promote its purpose, scattered to the winds of Heaven all the plans of improvement in the condition of the Country, by clipping the thread of Harrison’s life at the very moment when he had been raised to the summit of power, and when all the hopes of a liberal administration of the National Government were concentrated upon him— I called at Charles’s Office, and then with him at Pool the Taylor’s, where I ordered a winter waistcoat and pair of Pantaloons.— Returned to Charles’s house, and he brought me in his Gig home to Quincy. He dined with us, and then returned to Boston— At 7 this evening I went with my wife, and my Granddaughter Mary-Louisa, to a concert at the Hancock house, by the Rainers, A German Swiss family of itinerant musicians— There were this evening four men, and one woman—dressed in the costume of their country— They sang 12 popular songs and duets, the woman accompanying with a Guitar; and two of the men, accompanied one of the songs with Zitterns— Small rooms, and a crowded auditory.

The morning was stormy and threatening, with some rain: my wife intended to have gone into Boston, but was deterred by the aspect of the weather till after dinner when she went in with Mrs Kirk; to conclude arrangements with Charles’s wife who has concluded to go with her to Washington— Mary went and dined with Mrs T. B. Adams, and Louisa C. Smith, went intending to dine at Mr John Greenleaf’s—but when she got there, they had dined, and Mrs Mary Dawes had walked out— She went to Mrs T. B. Adams’s, and upon Elizabeth’s mentioning that Louisa C. Smith, was at her mother’s and dined there, said no—she had not been there this day. My wife returned from Boston between 6 and 7. and sent Kirk with the Carriage to bring home Mary from Mrs T. B. Adams’s, and Louisa C. Smith from Mr John Greenleaf’s— Now came the qui-pro-quo. At Mrs T. B. Adams’s Kirk was told that Miss Smith was not at Mr Greenleaf’s, and did not go there for her. He brought Mary home, and then—where was Miss Smith— for Mrs Mary Dawes had expressly declared that Miss Smith was not at Mr Greenleaf’s and had not been there this day— I sent John Kirk with the Chaise to Mr Greenleaf’s, where she had been waiting on tenter-hooks for hours, and he at last brought her home— The solution of the mystery was that before she got to Mr Greenleaf’s house, Mary Dawes had walked out— They dined about Noon. Mr Lunt paid us an evening visit, and made a present to my wife of his new Psalter, or hymn-book— There are 702 hymns and 6 doxologies—of the hymns 22 are of my composition, numbered 8. 21. 27. 38. 42. 75. 112. 138— 154. 347. 352. 354. 424. 471. 476. 536. 567. 640. 641 665. 691. 701. most of them versions of the Psalms. When they are longer than two or three Stanzas he takes merely enough for a hymn to be sung at one time, and he deals with Watts and Doddridge as with me— Parts of my lines to Mrs Nancy Hellen, my Plymouth hymn and one or two more, have already been inserted in other compilations made for Churches, of which there have been many since Dr Belknap. It is perhaps rather to be regretted that there are so many different compilations, and I regret especially that the practice of using an entire version of the Psalms has been abandoned, and a few of them selected, in fragments, mingled up with other hymns. I believe my own version of the Psalms more harmonious as English verse, and more connected in thought than any other extent in the English language; and I record this opinion because I am the only one of the race of man who ever will entertain it— Mr Lunt informed me that at a parish meeting on the 8th. of last March a Committee of 7 members was chosen to examine and report upon Mr Lunt’s book, and that a parish meeting would be held to morrow afternoon, immediately after the service to receive the report of the Committee.— Mr Lunt is going to New-York to preach during the month of December— Mr William Ware to preach for him here.

[“]For unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance; but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.” This is a passage in which minute criticism detects an inconsistency— But no part of the holy scriptures was written for captious readers; nor is moral truth ever to be taught by mathematical precision of language— Mr Lunt did not notice the arithmetical impossibility of taking away from nothing, but discoursed upon the text as containing a moral principle and affording instruction for the practice of Christians— The text is the conclusion form the double parable, and of the two Stewards, and the lesson is not with reference to the possession, but to the employment of talents— The steward who had the ten talents had received only five, which he had by diligent employment of them increased to ten. He who had received one, had not wasted or lost it; but having neglected to employ it— He had nothing of his own acquirement then, and so that which he had, the original deposit was taken away from him— Mr Lunt read a notice of the parish meeting to be held, immediately after the afternoon service. Mr Joseph Angier of Milton preached this afternoon from Hebrews 13.18. “Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.” The middle part of this verse—for we trust we have a good conscience,—is the text of the sample Sermon in Sterne’s Tristram Shandy— A Sermon so strangely introduced to the world—so excellent in itself, and so generally read as the pioneer of 45 sermons of Mr Yorick, among the best in the English language, makes it dangerous for any preacher of later days to discourse upon it.— Mr Angier committed no plagiarism upon Yorick— It did not appear from his discourse that he had read the Sermon of Sterne, and I scarcely know that I had a right to be reminded of it, as I was.— Mr Angier read again the notification of the parish meeting to be held immediately after the service, and it was held accordingly— Mr Peter Whitney the Senior pastor, and chairman of the Committee of 7. appointed on the 8th. of last March to examine and report upon Mr Lunt’s Christian Psalter, presided at the Meeting— Mr Brigham read the report which was unanimous for the adoption of the book, for the Sunday singing of the Society— After some aukward silence the report was accepted, by a show of hands, unanimously, and then after some debate, by a second unanimous show of hands— Mr Beale and his daughter Caroline visited us this Evening.

Foster at Boston— My wife had fixed upon this day for her departure with the family for Washington; but there was this morning a fall of snow which covered the ground; followed by rain which carried it all off, and in the Evening a gale, which yet did not clear the sky— She therefore concluded to postpone her departure at least for this day— The eccentric if not wit-distempered clergyman of East-Greenwich, Rhode-Island, Thomas Williams came this morning, before Sunrise, accompanied by his Son, now a student at the Cambridge Law-school, and took a full hour of my time, waiting for Gillet’s Omnibus to take them to Boston— He had been there, with the intent to preach at one of the so called orthodox churches, but their pastors declined admitting him into their pulpits, and so he went to Weymouth, and preached there yesterday for Mr Perkins. According to his account the orthodox churches are miserably distracted with dissensions, and the theological institution of Andover, has itself become a school of infidelity. The son, appears to be a sober-minded young man. This was the day of the annual election of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Senators, and members of the house of Representatives for this commonwealth— I attended at the town hall, just before noon, and gave a printed vote for John Davis as Governor, George Hull, Lieutenant Governor, Appleton Howe, Melatiah Everett and James M. Robbins, Senators for the County of Norfolk, and in manuscript Lysander Richards, Representative for the town—not one of whom is probably elected.— The Boston Daily Advertiser of this morning, republishes from the Southern Literary Messenger, my Canzonet to Sally, with about half a dozen blunders of the press— I took it to the Office of the Quincy Patriot, and asked him, if he should republish it, to have the errors of the press corrected— He promised he would and took a minute of them all.— He had republished in the last Saturday’s Patriot, from some Southern paper the lines to Ellen Bruce, with two gross errors of the press— I pointed them out to him, and he said he would publish them corrected with the Canzonet in next Saturday’s paper. I called at the Post Office, and left there a packet for Eleazer Homer enclosing the papers of Peter Mackintosh; and at the Quincy Stone Bank, and drew 150. dollars by a check. After I had closed and sealed my packet for Michael Leary at Killarney in Ireland, I received this morning a Letter dated 16. October, signed by him and his son John, who he acknowledges has settled with him for all Jeremy’s property, except, the two Notes. I therefore opened my sealed packet, and added a postscript to my Letter to Michael Leary— "

Tuesday  The storm abated but the weather was so unsettled comfortless and boisterous that my wife concluded to postpone her departure for one day more, and after entering the record of yesterday upon the diary before breakfast, the remnant of the day and eveng were occupied in preparing for the winter emigration to the South— There were 619 votes cast yesterday in Quincy with a majority of 50— for the democratic ticket—but a few votes were wanting to accomplish the election of a representative of the town in the State Legislature. The candidates were Lysander Richards and William B. Duggan the vote 280 to 304—but about 35 scattering votes defeated the election of Duggan, much the cunningest and most active demagogue of the town— They adjourned to 9 O’Clock this morning, for a second trial, when Duggan was elected by a vote oftoI voted yesterday and this day for Richards. I met Mr Josiah Brigham, who thought the prospects of the election very unfavourable— Of the three present Senators for the County only one is re-elected Appleton Howe of Weymouth; with the aid of 30 or 40 abolition votes— I called at the Quincy Patriot Office, and had an error of the press corrected, in the Canzonet to Sally, which I overlooked yesterday— I have an enormous accumulation of pamphlets among my papers, upon an infinite variety of subjects, great numbers of which are well worthy of being preserved; but they are in such confusion, that in a series of years I have never had time to select and those which I propose to have bound in volumes.— In the last fortnight I have snatched every moment I could spare to commence the collection, and took to Caleb Gill the Stationer and book-binder the first volume, of the assemblage, to which I give the general title of the Omnibus. I have now the materials for at least one hundred volumes, so scattered and dispersed, that whenever I want any one pamphlet, it is worth a weeks search to find it; and yet they swarm upon me, so that I can never keep them out of sight— The first volume of the Omnibus, consists of the pamphlet documents relating to the Amistad Captives, and to the cases of the Encomium, Comet and Enterprize— The second and third to Texas and Mexico, and the fourth to Defaulters. These I want to take with me to Washington— I have seven volumes more in a state of preparation, but not quite ready for the binder— 4. Volumes of my writings, as a bequest to my Son, and a third volume for my Granddaughter Mary Louisa to whom I have already given two volumes. John A Green was here this afternoon—and requested me to write to him from time to time, for publication in the Quincy-Patriot. And he asked me to make the same request of my son, at Boston; during the ensuing Session of the Legislature, of which he is again elected a member from Boston— "

My health has been drooping for the last fortnight, and within the last two days as string of pimple eruptions festering to boils have visited the nape of my neck, and sundry other parts of my head. I awoke this morning at the stroke of one from the Park-street Clock, and lay till it struck four in some uneasiness and pain without another wink of sleep. I then washed and dressed myself—repaired to Charles’s study; and sat down, and wrote for about three hours with occasional intervals to walk about the chamber. Finding myself growing chilly I returned half undressed to bed and slept about an hour till called up to breakfast by my Son— After which he went out to Quincy, and returned to dine.— I was so unwell that I sent for Dr Bigelow, who came and examined my ailments, and gave me medical advice. I kept house the whole day—excepting a walk round the common between one and two; in which I met judge Peter Thacher who turned and walked with me. I was idle—and skipping from book to book wasted one quarter of an hour after another till the day was gone, and I had done nothing useful— Charles has Facciolatis Lexicon with Forcellini’s improvements, and told me it was the best Latin Dictionary extant— My master Theophilus Parsons had said the same thing to me, more than thirty years ago— By way of trial I looked to the wood nubes, to see if I could find the quotation, which Wheeler the reporter for the National Intelligencer had imputed to me as repeating in a debate at the late Session of Congress.  Wheeler when I first asked him whence the quotation came, said it was from Horace but after searching for it he returned my Horace with a note, saying it was not in Horace, and he knew not whence it came— I found it now in Facciolati under the word minax. It is in the first book of Ovid’s Tristia Elegy 2., v. 23. 24.  Dr Shattuck and Dr Lowell were successively here this afternoon, urging me to deliver a Lecture before the Massachusetts historical Society, which I promised to do if my health will admit, next Monday week the 22d.— I received from Mr Lewis Tappan a large Quarto Bible, with an Address signed by Cinque, Kinna, and Kale three of the Amistad Africans; which Mr Tappan has been very desirous that I should receive from Cinque, at a public meeting, with an address that I should offer, but this I have repeatedly and perseveringly declined— I received also from H. G. Otis, Christopher Hughes’s papers— Harriet Welsh was here— "

Friday—  The night was nearly as restless and feverish as that which preceded— I awoke shortly after One O’Clock and lay awake till four—then rose, and being able to write did not return to bed— My head feels as if stung all over by a swarm of bees, or as if thickly broken out with the small pox— I sent again for Dr Bigelow who came and examined my head, and afterwards returned and applied to several of the eruptions two different kinds of ointment covered with rags and a handkerchief bound round my head; and he advised me to keep house all day—which being rainy made the confinement less irksome.— The William Mitchell who visited me yesterday is a Nantucket quaker who is here delivering before the Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge three Lectures upon Astronomy— I had seen him on my visit to Nantucket in September 1835. and had then mentioned to him that I possessed a copy of Bode’s Uranographia— He now brought me a recommendatory Letter from Barker Burnell—and said he had intended visiting me at Quincy to obtain a sight of that book; of which he believed there was not in this Country another copy.— A man by the name of James Oliver brought me this day a copy of a New Universal Atlas, in a process of publication, for my subscription which I declined— I had agreed to go with Harriet Welsh at Noon this day to see a picture of Henry Sargeant’s; but she came this morning and said he wished us to wait for a Sunny day. Degrand paid me a morning visit and brought me a statement of the Canals, Rail-roads and Navigable rivers opened to the State of New-York by the Western Rail-road, by himself; and three pamphlets, being the annual Reports to the Legislature of the Rail-road Corporations of the State of Massachusetts for 1839. and 1840. and a Report of the Engineer upon the several definite locations for the Hartford and Springfield Rail-road, with the Acts of incorporation in Connecticut and Massachusetts— He said he had sent a copy of his own statement to Governor Seward of New-York, and had received from him an answer that he had read it with gratification and astonishment— This subject is too vast for my faculties, and too oppressive for my infirmities— I must give it up, in despair— Time, and health, and capacity, and seventy-five winters upon my head, all admonish me to abstain from an undertaking which must break me down body and mind, without effecting any thing for the good of my Country or of mankind.— I return to my projected Article upon the War between Great-Britain and China, which occupied the leisure of this day. I find a difficulty and feel a necessity of closing the lecture, which I must leave like the adventure of the bear and fiddle. I received a Letter from my dear wife dated yesterday at the Astor-house, New-York— All well and a pleasant passage. "

A sound sleep of 7 hours from half past ten last Night till half past five this morning afforded me some relief from the depression of Spirits, and nervous agitation of the two preceeding almost sleepless Nights— But the pustulous eruptions upon my head, face and neck continue, increase and put my patient endurance to the trial of Job— Dr Frothingham paid me a morning visit, and while he was here Dr Bigelow came, and anointed my head afresh with the two ointments and promised to return to-morrow morning and perform again the same operation— Dr Frothingham spoke to me of Mr Lunt’s Christian Psalter, and said that the Committee of his church, consisting of himself, Charles Sprague and George Bancroft after examining the Book had unanimously agreed to recommend the adoption of it, as the hymn-book of the first congregational church, from and after the 1st. of January next. I told him that the parish at Quincy had unanimously voted to adopt it as their hymn-book; without fixing the time as there was not a supply of the books yet bound, and that I had been happy to furnish Mr Lunt with a small portion of his Selection— Miss Harriet Welsh came, and I went with her and saw Mr Henry Sargeant’s picture of the Crucifixion— He said he painted not for money; but he must paint, and he had made a present of this picture, for an altar piece to a new Roman Catholic Church at Charlestown— Mr Sargeant is a painter of very considerable merit, and this picture is well adapted to its destination— I visited several shops seeking for a cap which I may wear at home and in public, but could not suit myself. Also for a Bible to give to my Grandson Charles Francis which I did find— Towards evening I had a visit from Mr George Bancroft who had a long conversation with me, concerning our revolutionary history, and particularly the agency of my father in the origin and management of it— He read to me the copy of my father’s Letter to Samuel Adams, introducing me to him when I returned from France to this Country in 1785 when my father was going as Minister to England— Mr Bancroft repeated his request for a confidential inspection of my father’s papers, spoke very respectfully of his correspondence with Samuel Adams which he had seen, and professed a full determination to do entire justice to his character.— I called before dinner at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s house, but he was not at home— He sent me a note inviting me to come and take tea, and spend the Evening with him and his family which I did— I had a long talk with him upon politics, and he gave me his unvarnished opinion of Webster— While I was out, Mr Peter C. Brooks came and spent an hour with Charles, but was gone before I returned. "

Heard Dr Frothingham this morning from Matthew 14.19.— [“]and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake; and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude”— There is always a refined ingenuity in the application of the Doctors Texts to his discourses.— Of this stupendous miracle, I was curious to know what he would make— He spoke of it first as of a miracle intended to operate as evidence upon the minds of those by whom it was witnessed; but he said that in this as in other miracles of Jesus there was something typical of the great objects of the mission of Christ upon earth—he came to feed mankind with the bread of life; and one of his purposes in the performance of this miracle was to shew that there was in beneficence a self multiplying power.— That in the maxims of the world a benevolent man seeks riches to enable him to distribute bountifully, but it was the property of this expansive benevolence to reverse that order of things, and to distribute freely thereby to become rich— To this principle he applied several other passages of the Scriptures, and from it he deduced a persuasive exhortation to liberality—beneficence, brotherly kindness, charity— The afternoon text was from Revelation 2.17.— [“]To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.” This is a highly mystical text, the full meaning of which is subject to a great variety of conjectures.— About sixteen years ago I heard the late Dr Bedell of Philadelphia, preach at Washington a sermon upon this text which stamp’d it indelibly upon my memory. There was in that Sermon a classical history of the practice of exchanging white stones with a reciprocal inscription of names upon them, as talismanic tokens of friendship and mutual hospitality which greatly excited my curiosity, but to which Dr Frothingham did not specially allude— Mr Thomas B. Curtis was here with a Letter from James K Paulding late Secretary of the Navy, remonstrating against a project which he says there is of employing Pedrich to carve bas relief’s for the statue of Washington still to be set up on a pedestal in the Rotundo of the Capitol at Washington. He calls upon Mr Curtis and the conoscenti here to interpose and save the Statue from profanation Mr Curtis asked my advice, and it was to ask Governor Lincoln to write to President Tyler and represent that bas-reliefs by Peddrich to a Statue by Greenough, would be a sculptural incongruity; and said I would cheerfully say the same thing to Mr Tyler on my return to Washington— Paulding is snarlingly bitter upon Peddrich and Persico— Degrand was here and gave me a statement concerning Mail contracts and Railroads. Spent the Evening with Charles at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s— "

Monday  After an uneasy and suffering Night my complaint was more harassing and irritated this morning than it had been yet, and with this thorn in the flesh, I am tortured with the task of finishing a Lecture to be delivered this day week before the Massachusetts historical Society upon China— Dr Bigelow was here and dressed the wounds upon which I had afterwards some partial relief— I must arrest and close my lecture, before I have explored even the threshold of my subject. It would require at least three Lectures at least as that which I am now about to cut short to fill up the outline that I have drawn. And I have not now time, even to prepare a second. Miss Harriet Welsh was here, and afterwards Mr Robert Treat Paine who told me that he had no encouragement to expect the appointment which he has been so solicitous to obtain of Secretary of Legation, at some one of the European Courts, but that he has determined to go to Europe, with the aid only of his own resources, and to visit London, Paris, Vienna and Saint Petersburg, in the pursuit of his astronomical studies— He offered his services to me as a correspondent or otherwise; for which I thanked him, without positively knowing whether I should need them, or could with propriety employ them— My Son went to Quincy and returned to dine. My time was hurried away in reading the Correspondence relating to China, communicated to Parliament by the British Ministry in 1840. and a few pages of a small Volume called Six Months with the Chinese expedition, or leaves from a Soldier’s Note Book, by Lord Jocelyn, late Military Secretary to the China Mission— The time consumed in reading is lost for labour— I skimmed the surface also of the Messages to H.R.U.S. of 25. February 1840. and of 25. January 1841. concerning our relations political and commercial relations with China. Towards Sunset I walked out and stop’d at Dr Frothingham’s; met there Mr William H. Prescott, the historian of Ferdinand and Isabella, with his wife— I had much conversation with him upon historical topics, and enquired if the rumour in circulation was well founded that he was preparing for publication a history of Mexico— A history he said of the Conquest of Mexico; and that he had received from the Academy of History of Mexico a great mass of original documents not known to exist when Doctor Robertson wrote, and highly valuable to elucidate many events and characters of that time— We talked much of Isabella and Ximenes, and Catherine of Arragon, and bloody Mary, and Anne Boleyn, and Queen Elizabeth and Gonzalvo de Cordova and others— Mr and Mrs Prescott soon departed— I remained took tea and spent the Evening with Dr Frothingham, with whom I had long conversation upon undry biblical topics— Charles came in, and spent the latter part of the Evening with us.

I brought this morning to an aukward and abrupt conclusion the Article upon China which, I began about this time last year, and which I have never yet found time to finish. This article, I propose to deliver next Monday before the Massachusetts historical Society, if the State of my health should be such as will enable me to speak in public at-all. The importunities besetting me for the delivery of these Lectures are distressing. It is not in my nature to reject them rudely: to comply with them becomes from week to week more precarious of possible accomplishment. From this uncertainty result uncertain and procrastinated answers and finally no answers at-all— I had last Wednesday promised to deliver a Lecture at Lynn, next Thursday evening, if my health should permit— Until this day that has been uncertain, but this afternoon I wrote to Mr Stephen Oliver, informing him that it will not be possible.— Whether I shall be more able to speak next Monday begins to be problematical. Dr Bigelow dressed my head again this morning, and spoke encouragingly though not undoubtingly of the healing aspect of the disease. He hopes I may be able to proceed the week after next for Washington. In the mean time, I am much disabled for writing, and the shaking of my hand makes it irksome in the extreme— Mr Thomas B. Curtis was here this morning; with a Letter from Levi Lincoln, now Collector of the Customs at this port, to the President of the United States, in the most respectful terms remonstrating against the employment of foreigners, upon bas-reliefs to the pedestal of Greenough’s Statue of Washington in the Rotundo of the Capitol. Governor Lincoln, wished that I should see the Letter before it was despatched, and I approved of it altogether. Mr Curtis read to me also a Letter from the Committee on the fine arts, of the Boston Athenaeum to the Secretary of the Navy on the same subject— Mr Curtis invited me to a party at his house to-morrow evening at half past 8. where Miss Sloman is to perform on the Piano. While he was here President Quincy of Harvard University came in, to join in the remonstrances against the employment of Peddrich for tawdry appendages to Greenough’s Statue. Mr Henry Clark was here about a claim against the Government of Spain, under a Treaty of 1836. of indemnity for some spoliation in the Island of Porto-Rico.— The claim was at first of William Clark an intimate acquaintance of my early years, and of whom this Gentleman is the youngest brother. He tells me that his brother William was finally settled and died in the Island of Porto Rico— He says that Mr Webster informed him they were in negotiation with Spain to obtain payment of the interest and principal of this claim by orders upon the revenues from the Island of Cuba. I spent the first part of this Evening with my old friend Joseph Hall, and his Sister, and the latter part at Dr. George Parkmans, who, though lame, insisted upon walking with me home. "

My discouragements in regard to health are oppressive. Besides the eruptions on my head and neck I have now a pimple at the joint between the fore and middle finger of my right hand the very spot on which I am obliged to rest the handle of my pen in writing.— The appearance of this page may be the best record of the pain and difficulty with which I write.— This morning there was for three hours a flight of snow. Dr Bigelow was here with a dressing, and with such cheering as he could give and Miss Welsh brought me a white cotton cap which is yet to be fitted to my head— After the snow was over I sallied forth to the Barbers, at the Tremont house, and on my way met Governor Lincoln and Mr Isaac P. Davis who were coming to pay me a morning visit. After being shaved I went with Mr Davis to Daggett’s shop, and saw several pictures, among which two by Copley, perhaps Nicholas Boylston and his wife. Also a Madonna and child, copied from Murillo, and of which Mr Davis said he had made a present to Mrs Webster— The rest of the day I lounged away at home, reading Lord Jocelyn’s leaves from a Soldier’s notebook, containing a very light and unsatisfactory account of the occupation of the Island of Chusan by the British expedition in 1840.—and of the partial negotiation for a suspension of hostilities between Captain Elliot the Chief Superintendent and the Chinese imperial Commissioner Kea-shen on the 30th. of August of that year—at the mouth of the Peiho river— This writer calls Chusan the most beautiful Island of the celestial Empire— I read also further in the two Messages from the President concerning our relations with China, and a few pages of another small duodecimo called China, and its resources and peculiarities, physical, political, social, and commercial, with a view of the opium question, and a notice of Assam—by Robert Mudie, I suppose a Scotchman; published at London, April 1840— This man supposes that the War, will break up forever the British trade with China in tea, and proposes to transfer it together with the cultivation of the tea-plant itself to the kingdom of Assam, adjoining upon China, and now in possession of the British.— Early this Evening my Son went out and delivered an introductory Lecture before the Lyceum at Brookline— While he was gone I wrote a short Letter to my wife, and had visits; first from Dr George Parkman, notwithstanding his lameness—then from P. P. F Degrand, and finally from Edward Brooks— Degrand is a walking library of information upon the subject of Steamboats and Railways— Between 9 and 10. my son came home from his lecturing expedition to Brookline, and went to the musical party at Mr. Thomas B. Curtis’s, where Miss Sloman was to perform on the Piano— I had not the heart to attend a fashionable party; and sent an excuse. "

Dr Bigelow paid his daily visit— The crown of my head is hideous to behold— Miss Welsh brought me a volume of a republication by the Harper’s of New-York, in two duodecimo volumes by John Francis Davis, entitled the Chinese, a general description of the Empire of China and its inhabitants— This Davis was for some time the Chief Superintendent of the British trade in China, after the expiration of the exclusive privilege of the East-India Company— There was at noon this day, a meeting of the Massachusetts historical Society which I attended— It was the monthly meeting, one week in advance of the usual day, the last Thursday of the month— Next Thursday being the annual Thanksgiving day.— The meeting was unusually numerous, about 25 members being present— Among them was Mr Francis C. Gray just returned from a 6 months tour in Europe— He brought with him, and presented to the Society a complete copy of the original edition of Purchas’s pilgrims in five folio volumes, and in perfectly good condition.— Also a voluminous work upon the Statistics of France, which I had not time to examine. John C. Gray was nominated as a member of the Society, to take the place of judge Charles Jackson who has resigned.— Robert C. Winthrop invited me to the club at his house next Wednesday evening— Leverett Saltonstall told me that Caleb Cushing was now at Newbury-port, and that he had with him yesterday a sharp altercation— Cushing has become an obsequious partizan of President Tyler, and rumours are afloat, that he is about to be married to his daughter Elizabeth— Some curiosity was expressed at this meeting as to the subject upon which I should Lecture next Monday evening, as I have conditionally promised, if my health should permit— I said it was yet uncertain whether it would be in my power. But if it should, my subject would be the War between Great Britain and China—and it might be so announced.— After the meeting I took a half hour’s walk before dinner— After dinner Mr Seth Williams, brought me a Letter of recommendation from Mr John Marston of Taunton. Mr Williams was heretofore Collector for the port of Dighton or Fall-river—removed by General Jackson, and now an aspirant for restoration. We had successive evening visits from Dr George Parkman, and Dr Frothingham— "

Rain all night and part of this day— The remainder dull gloomy and cheerless— Dr Bigelow was here; but the progress of my convalescence is slow and uncertain— Mr Joseph Vaill was here as a solicitor of contributions for Amherst College; an institution which cannot support itself, runs constantly in debt and from time to time sends round mendicant agents to levy contributions—upon the charitable— Mr Vaill is a Clergyman and has left his congregation to pursue this life of itinerant beggary. His argument of appeal to the benevolent is that Amherst College has been established about twenty years, and has in that time educated upwards of 800 students, more than half of whom have been and are, ministers of the gospel—and that the Legislature of the Commonwealth have been inflexibly deaf to all their supplications, though often liberal to other institutions, and especially to the University at Cambridge. I subscribed to Mr Vaill’s book for a small contribution— I walked out before dinner, and called at the Office of Mr Ellis Gray Loring, with whom I had about an hour’s conversation— He is under no small concern, from apprehension upon two points at the approaching Session of Congress, one the rule, excluding the reception of all petitions, resolutions and papers relating to Slavery— And the other upon a revived project of annexing Texas to the United States—a project, of which formal notice has been given in newspapers devoted to the interests and aspirations of President Tyler. I look forward to both these designs with alarm and anguish—not for the power of the South which can effect nothing by itself; but from experience of the treachery of the Northern representation both to Northern interests and principles. I spoke also to Mr Loring of the Letter purporting to be from Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Adams of which he sent me a copy, and the genuineness of which is very problematical. I asked him if access could be obtained to Samuel Adams’s papers— His Grandson Samuel Adams Welles had issued a prospectus of a Memoir of his life, and writings in six Octavo volumes, but could not prevail upon any book printing establishment to undertake it— Mr Loring said he would make enquiries whether among Mr. Adams’s papers any trace can be found of a letter from him to Jefferson, to which this purports to be an answer.— From dinner time for the remainder of the day and Evening I was confined to the house; but could make no progress in writing—the fingers of my right hand being crippled— I got through the reading of the Parliamentary papers relating to China, a ponderous folio of nearly 500 pages—and glancing again over the Message from President Van Buren to H.R.U.S. of 25. February 1840. found in it sundry documents once, twice and even thrice repeated— They all confirm me in the view taken in my lecture of the issue between Great Britain and China in their present War, which is so adverse to the prevailing prejudices of the time and place, that I expect to bring down a storm upon my head worse than that with which I am already afflicted— "

I awoke and rose this morning with a head ache, and sore throat; doubting if it would be possible for me to deliver my lecture on Monday, and hating to think of it— My head ache afterwards passed away—the sore-throat was less troublesome, and Doctor Bigelow, who visited me after the morning service dismissed one of the bandages on my head— Heard Dr Frothingham from Isaiah 5.20. “Wo unto them that call evil good and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. 21. Wo unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight.” This perversion of principle the Doctor remarked was applicable to three different classes of men— 1. To those who have been educated under vicious or imperfect systems of morals—false religions, or inveterate national usages and prejudices. 2. To wicked and perverse individuals and 3. To speculative visionary enthusiasts who promulgate their own fancies for new discoveries in religion and morality. Of this class there is at this time a school very busy and mischievous in this region. German mystification, French Atheism, and English Pyrrhonism are all combined in producing this half religious half infidel vagary, which has penetrated deeply into the theological school at Cambridge, and even into that of Andover. It is called transcendentalism, and the main object of it is to undermine the Christian religion by discrediting the scriptures both of the old and new Testament. This new sect has taken the place of a school of avowed atheism, broken up a few years since by the conviction of its high priest, Abner Kneeland upon an indictment for blasphemy.— The present heresies are of a more dangerous character because the propagators of them are ministers of the gospel of good reputation and blameless lives.— Dr Frothingham remarked that such had been the founders of the greatest and most pernicious errors which have afflicted mankind; as an instance of which he mentioned Peter the hermit the first preacher of the Crusades. After the morning service, and before dinner we had a visit from Harriet Welsh. After dinner at the first Church, Mr Alexander Young, Minister of the new South Church preached from Luke 8.25. “And he said unto them, where is your faith?”— Without further allusion to the occasion upon which these words were spoken by Jesus, the argument of the discourse was to shew that there was great reason for us all to address this enquiry to ourselves; and he complained of a great decay of faith in our country at this time—glancing at the same heresies against which Dr Frothingham had remonstrated this morning— I spent the latter part of this Evening, with Charles at Mr P. C. Brooks’s, en famille— "

It proved to be a fire at Charlestown by which five houses were destroyed. This morning Deacon Spear was here from Quincy. I have totally neglected my property there this Season, and not once visited either the Mount Wollaston, or the Penn’s valley farm— I told him that Mrs T. B. Adams wished to transfer to him the power which I have given to Luther Angier for the management of the house and land in Braintree, the rents and profits of which I have given to her for her life, intending the remainder for her surviving children as joint tenants— That I have sent to ask the return of Luther Angier’s power, and should then make out one to him— I spoke also about the sale of the Quincy Woodlot which Mr Lemuel Humphrey surveyed for us last year; and of which there are so many proprietors that we can scarcely ascertain who they are.— I must leave this to him, and my son— He told me that they had received a supply of Mr Lunt’s Christian Psalter, at Quincy, and began the use of it as a hymn-book at meeting yesterday— Dr George Parkman called this morning, and found me reading to myself my lecture upon the British and Chinese War. At his request I read it through to him. It took me upwards of an hour and a half, and for fear of becoming insufferably tedious to the auditory I struck out as much as abridged about a quarter of an hour of the delivery— Mr Felt who is one of the lecture committee of the historical Society came before dinner and proposed to me to go to the Masonic temple this evening in a carriage, which I declined— It was then raining, but I thought it would hold up before night— The rain instead of subsiding increased after dinner. Mr Francis C. Gray, another member of the lecture Committee came, and urged me to go with him, in a Carriage with which he would come for me at ten minutes before 7. to which I consented. He came accordingly and I went with him and my Son; the rain coming down in floods. The Masonic hall was crowded to overflowing. I delivered the lecture, curtailed as it had been, in one hour and twenty-minutes— After I finished, Coll. T. H Perkins Mr Abbott Lawrence, Dr Francis Parkman, and several others came and greeted me— Mr Lawrence said that Mrs Lawrence was so much indisposed with her cold that she had not been able to come out, and wished to borrow it for the opportunity of reading it, and accordingly I put the manuscript into his hands Mr F C. Gray returned with us to my Son’s house, the rain still falling copiously, and there left us— From my first great anxiety respecting this lecture, I am now relieved— It was heard without manifestation of disapprobation; but it runs directly contrary to the strong current of popular opinion in this Country and will be handled without mercy by political antagonists.

Tuesday  Dr. George Parkman called here early this morning, and proposed to me to visit an English artist by the name of Howorth who practices the art of transferring old pictures from one Canvass to another— He came again an hour after and I went with him— Howorth himself is a portrait painter—we saw several old pieces of canvas from which pictures had been transferred, but only one, on the new canvas, an old fragment of the Venetian school, the appearance of which was in no wise commendatory of the art. There was a full length portrait of Mrs Sargent, the mother of Daniel and Henry Sargent and their brothers—painted by Copley in 1763. when he was but 19 and the Lady only 17 years old— One of the best of Copley’s pictures painted before he went to England. Dressed in a blue satin robe much embroidered, with arms bare to the elbow, but shadowed by deep lace ruffles gathered round the arms, and coming down almost to the hands.— I knew this Lady when she was from 45 to 50 years of age, and she had several grown up sons.— The canvas had taken some damage, and has been repaired and new varnished by Mr Howorth— The colours are as fresh as if painted yesterday. I called next with Dr. Parkman at the house of Mr Ralph Bennet Forbes, but he was not at home.— I visited Mr George Ticknor and had half an hour’s conversation with him on indifferent topics, but found it his opinion that the education of women in this country at present is of an higher order than that of the men— I left cards at the houses of H. G. Otis and Saml T. Armstrong, from the latter of whom I had received this morning a Letter with a pamphlet, being the 32d. annual report of the American board of foreign missions. As I was returning home I met Revd. Saml. K. Lothrop who had just called to see me, and returned with me—while he was here Mr P. Q. Mason brought me a Letter from George Roberts, Editor of the Times and Notion Newspaper, requesting permission for Mr Mason, to read my last Evenings lecture to make an abstract of it for the newspaper, as he had not been able to get a seat last evening to take notes— I told him I had lent the manuscript, but if he would call to-morrow morning at 9. he should have the perusal of it— Then came in Mr Peter C. Brooks junr. with Mr Ralph Bennet Forbes, who has been long in China, and of whom I made many inquiries—he promised me sundry books and pamphlets on the subject, and advised me to see his cousin Cushing at Watertown. Mr Degrand was here just before 5. when I went with my Son, and dined with Josiah Quincy junr. his father and mother, William and Mrs Minot, Miss Sedgwick, George Ticknor and Francis C. Gray constituted the company. "

Mr Mason from the Times and Notion Office called this morning for the manuscript of my lecture, which I lent him to make an abstract from it for publication in the Newspaper. I pointed out to him the parts which I had omitted in the delivery, and requested him not to notice them. He said he was not; but said if I would consent he would publish all that I did deliver. I declined—having promised it to Dr Palfrey, as an Article for the North American Review— A succession of visitors named in the margin— Dr Bigelow thinks me nearly recovered—advertised me with regard to the condition of my head, and promised to call again next Saturday morning. Mr Otis invited me to dine with him to-morrow, being Thanksgiving day, but I was engaged— Dr George Parkman came and engaged to go with me this afternoon, to see Mr Cushing at Watertown but he afterward, called and left word that Mr Cushing would be absent from home attending the funeral of the widow of the late Mr James Perkins— Major J. W Ripley of the U.S. army, superintendent of the armoury at Springfield, came with Mr Sidney Brooks— He left with me a manuscript report of 3. commissioners appointed by the Secretary of War, to examine and report to him on the condition of that establishment, and he asked me to appoint a time at which I could see him again to have some conversation with me on the subject; for which I accordingly fixed to-morrow morning at 9.— Going out I met Mr R. B. Forbes, who had sent me this morning a number of pamphlets concerning China, and said he was engaged to attend the funeral of Mrs Perkins this afternoon— I called at Mr Ellis Gray Loring’s Office, and returned to him the Letter purpoting to be from Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Adams, which he had sent me, and of which he promises to furnish me with a copy— After dinner Dr. N. L. Frothingham, and Mr Gould, a Committee from the Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge came with an earnest invitation to me, to repeat my Lecture, on the Chinese War, before that Society next Friday Evening, to which I consented. The Lecture was so different from what was expected and from the opinions prevailing here, that it has produced what is called a sensation not of approbation, but of curiosity. The Revd. Dr Francis Parkman called at half past 8. and I went with him to the Wednesday Evening club at Robert C. Winthrop’s.— Of my old Associates of that institution there was present only the late U.S. District judge John Davis—with about fifteen men of a later generation. Dr Parkman accompanied me home between 10 and 11. This was the night of the splendid Ball given to the Prince de Joinville at Faneuil hall— I visited Mr Edward Brooks at the Tremont house. "

Major Ripley came at 9 this morning according to appointment— I had read the report of the Commissioners Davies, Chase and Tyler, to the Secretary of War, on the condition of the armoury at Springfield which he had yesterday left with me— It discloses some gross abuses in the management of that establishment for the discovery of which the major seems to apprehend that he will receive small thanks, and that there is a weight of influence operating against him and against all reform of these abuses—an influence—not confined to one party, and from which he did not consider either President Tyler, or W. B. Calhoun, the Representative in Congress from Springfield as exempt— He spoke of an extraordinary and altogether unnecessary number of sinecure appointments of Military Store keepers, among whom is Cooper the superannuated Stage player, ill qualified as he may be for the performance of duties involving a public trust. Major Ripley doubts the legal authority of the Secretary of War to make these appointments, and gave me a paper containing references to the acts of Congress on the subject— The report concerning the Springfield Armoury will come before Congress— Professor Espy was here before and after the religious services of the day. At the first congregational church, Dr Frothingham after an admirable occasional prayer, preached from Job. 22.17. [“]Which said unto God—what can the Almighty do for them? 18. Yet he filled their houses with good things.” The Sermon was an exhortation to universal gratitude, for the enjoyment of blessings bestowed alike upon all— Professor Espy’s visits, were to urge me to bring forward in Congress his discoveries in the Science of Meteorology, and his philosophy of Storms. He has been lecturing on this subject with various success in England, France, and here at Boston, where he fares better than any where else.— I dined and spent the Evening at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s with a large family party; besides whom, his son Gorham and his son Edward’s wife were detained by indisposition— Edward Everett, his wife and children, absent in Europe, and Charles’s wife and two children absent at Washington.— Mr Frothingham’s eldest son is also absent abroad— Mrs Gorham Brooks took us in her carriage, and also brought us home.

Mr Degrand came this morning and went with us to meeting, where Mr Brazer of Salem performed the service morning and afternoon instead of Dr Frothingham— His morning text was from 2. Corinthians 1.12 [“]For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our Conscience that in simplicity, and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to you ward.” The discourse was an impressive dissertation upon the blessing of a good conscience, and the pre-eminent virtue and simplicity of heart— The afternoon sermon, was from Hosea, 10.12—[“]break up your fallow ground.” This is only part of the verse— The imagery of the prophet urges reformation from wicked agency— Mr Brazer understood and argued it as rousing to energy from inaction.— The reasoning was therefore not closely adapted to the precept of the prophet but it was sufficiently congenial to the text, taken by itself, and like the morning discourse was a very excellent moral essay— There is no infirmity of which human nature is more susceptible than insincerity, and no vice more reprobated by Christ in his doctrines than hypocrisy— There are shades of depravity in this vice, and in the intercourse with the world, it is difficult to draw the line, between the courtesies which custom has introduced, and usage has rendered indispensable, and the strict regard to truth required for sincerity— These conventional forms of civility, such as subscribing yourself your correspondents’ humble servant are not chargeable to hypocrisy nor even to insincerity, but they are the forms of a hypocritical world, and their tendency is vicious— I conform to them reluctantly, and avoid them frequently— Jefferson after the French Revolution always did—and it would have been well for him if he had carried his aversion to insincerity further than the disuse of its formulary words.— The duty of breaking up the fallow ground, is directly applicable to the political principle of internal improvement— Can I not break up some of my own fallow ground— Have I ever duly considered that every public-trust is at once a chair and a school of moral philosophy? From the close of the afternoon service, we were engaged in the anxious occupation of packing up for our departure to-morrow morning, except two hours of the Evening which we spent at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s Gorham Brooks, and his wife were there, and Mr Brazer the preacher of the day— I sent the manuscript of my lecture upon China to Dr. Palfrey, with authority to use it at his pleasure—and I enclosed Gelon of Syracuse to Ellis Gray Loring.

O’Clock this morning I was awaked by a peal of Bells rung for a fire, which lasted nearly an hour— About half past five, a fire blazed out from the chimney of the house we were about to leave, but it passed off in ten or fifteen minutes—about 3 in the morning it had begun to snow, and at dawn of day the ground was well powdered, and the snow seemed to hold up. At 7. my Son and myself repaired to the Cars at the depot of the Worcester Springfield and Hudson railway, expecting to reach Hudson between 6 and 7 this evening— With the rising of the Sun the snow recommenced, and fell thick and fast till about 2. P.M. when we reached Springfield, having already been arrested several times ten or fifteen minutes at a time by snow drifted across the road.— Here the Snow continuing unabated, my Son found that there was no prospect of reaching Hudson by the railway this Night—the necessary consequence of which would be the failure to reach New-York to-morrow— By the advice and care of my Son our baggage was withdrawn from the cars of the Hudson train; and after dining at Springfield we took the Stage for Hartford 28 miles, which we travelled on the eastern side of Connecticut river till we reached and crossed the Bridge at East-Hartford.— We exchanged horses at a place called Warehouse point 16 miles from Springfield and 12 from Hartford.— There were two Stages each crammed with nine passengers within and one or two outside.— Among the passengers in the Cars from Boston was that singular and equivocal personage, miss, and now called Countess America Vespucci, who came three years ago a sturdy beggar, to Congress for a grant of lands, because she claims to be descended from the adventurer whose name covers the two Continents of the Western Hemisphere, instead of that of Columbus— I did not recognize her. She travels without a male companion— As did miss Sedgwick the authoress, from whom we parted at Springfield; and with whom I had not the opportunity of so much conversation as I should have desired.— There was also a gentleman, a resident of Boston, named Dorr, who claimed kindred with me, as descended from the Revd. Moses Fiske, and his second wife, Anna daughter of Thomas Shepard, and widow of Daniel Quincy—my great great grandmother.— We reached Hartford about half past 8. O’Clock and stop for the night at the City Hotel— Here we met Isaac Hull Adams, who is here engineering upon the Northeastern boundary. "

Thursday—  My Granddaughter Mary-Louisa Adams 13—  I called with my Son at the President’s house to visit Mr Tyler, but he was engaged in cabinet Meeting—and did not receive us— We then called on Mr Thomas Baker Johnson my wife’s brother and found him in better apparent health than he has been these two years, but complaining as usual— I stop’d at the Franklin Insurance Company Office, and received the dividend of 5 per cent on the half year ending last Month, 316.75 by check on the Patriotic Bank bills payable in Virginia Bank Bills at a discount of 6 per cent— We then went to the Capitol, where in the Post Office of the house I met Robert Barnwell Rhett of South-Carolina, and Nicholas Tillinghast of Rhode-Island; members of the house.— Nobody in the Clerks Office— We viewed in the Rotundo Greenough’s Colossal Statue of Washington, which at first sight sympathetically struck Charles and myself as too close an imitation of the Jupiter of Phidias.— The hero is seated in a Chair like an antique Car, laboured like filagree with bas-reliefs and miniature sculpture. He is naked to the loins and thence downward covered with a blanket or coverlet—his right elbow resting on the arm of the chair; the arm lifted and pointing with the forefinger to the sky—the left hand on the hilt of a sheathed sword lying on his lap, and in the act of pushing it from him— We met there General Winfield Scott, with Adjutant General Roger Jones, and his brother Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones, and Thomas Henry, a member of the House from Pennsylvania. The statue is placed in the centre of the Rotundo, on a pedestal 9 feet high; upon which it was raised yesterday— The opinions with regard to its merit are greatly diversified—mine are highly favourable to it.— Returning home I stop’d at Taylor’s bookstore, and took a volume of Wyoming for Mary-Louisa, and Coll. Trumbull’s auto-biography for myself— It was Mary-Louisa’s birth day—always of intense anxiety to me, for her future destiny.— She had an evening party of her friends, schoolmates and family relations— The children kept up their dancing till 11, at Night.

Friday  Mr Kavasales came yesterday morning, again to solicit my good offices, to obtain for him an appointment as a chaplain in the navy— He has seen the new Secretary of that Department Upshur, and has received from him fair promises as he had from his predecessor; but nothing more. Mr Upshur told him that he had sent to the President only two names for navy chaplaincies; one of whom was William Tyler a nephew of the President— I intended to have called this morning on one or more of the heads of Departments; but it rained the whole day—so steadily that I could not go out till the dusk of evening. The rain was then succeeded by a thick fog— I walked out—left my Chronometer with Julien Montandon to be repaired. found my old servant M. A. Giusta with him— I then called upon another old acquaintance the shoemaker Thumlert and ordered a pair of Slippers which he promised to send me next Monday. I stop’d at the Office of the National Intelligencer, where they gave me three Boston Newspapers— Neither Gales nor Seaton was at the Office— Passed Midshipman Joseph H. Adams was here this morning, but declined dining with us, and Captain Robert C. Buchanan came in the Evening to take leave—his furlough has expired, and he has been ordered to Florida, upon duty. I received this day two Letters from Dr John G. Palfrey Editor of the North American Review, intimating in a very delicate manner his unwillingness to publish in that periodical journal, my lecture upon the War between Great Britain and China— And in a Letter to Charles, he proposes to return the manuscript— The excitement of public opinion, and feeling by the delivery of this lecture far exceeds any expectation that I had formed, although I did expect that it would be considerable. It is a loud and peremptory admonition of prudence to me, in the course that it will behoove me to pursue, through the impending session of Congress— Between the obligation to discharge my duty to the Country, and the obvious impossibility of accomplish any thing for the improvement of its condition, by Legislation, my deliberate judgment warns me to a systematic adherence to inaction, upon all the controverted topics, which cannot fail to be brought into debate— Upon the rule question I cannot be silent but shall be left alone as heretofore— I await the opening of the session with great anxiety—more from apprehension of my own imprudence than from a belief that the fortunes of the Country will be much affected for good or evil, by any thing that will be done— There is neither spotless integrity nor consummate ability at the helm of our public ship and she will be more than ever the sport of winds and waves, drifting between breakers and quicksand.— May the wise and good disposer send her home in safety.

Mr John Skirving brought and shewed me two drawings of furnaces by which he proposes to warm, and ventilate the Hall of the House of Representatives— He afterwards sent me his report to the Commissioner and Architect of the public buildings, and several coloured drawings of plans for cottage houses— I cabled this morning at the War department and had a long conversation, with the new Secretary John C. Spencer upon three several and diverse topics.— I delivered to him the application of Francis Le Baron of Plymouth for a warrant of Cadet at the Military Academy at West Point, together with the recommendations of him addressed to Mr Spencer himself—and I requested that the youth’s name might be entered on the files of the Department as a candidate for admission at the Academy— He enquired if there was a vacancy of the appointment for the District, and I told him there was not—that Wood had entered last June and that the vacancy was not to be expected before 1845. I also told him of the promise given me by the late Secretary of War Bell, of a warrant forDerby next June, of which he took note. 2. I read to him the Letter of Major Charles Larrabee to me of 6. Novr. last, and the passage of his pamphlet, in which quoting a paragraph, in Andrew Jackson’s Message of 8. December 1829. he says it charges me with a crime— It was certainly a base and malignant attack upon my administration which like others, from the same quarter I have treated with silent contempt: but with regard to the charge of an order from the War Department which he said he had revoked, as illegal, I had never known what the facts were, and wished now to ascertain them from the records of the Department— Mr Spencer said he would direct an examination of the records, and cause the results to be communicated to me. 3. I said I had received a Letter from Governor Seward of New-York enclosing a copy of a Letter from the Governor to him on the subject of the debts of the States. We had then much discourse upon the State debts, from which I infer that the policy of Mr Tyler is to have nothing to do with them, and that he is not prepared with any system of measures in relation to them— I have now only to wait for the message— Morning visit from Mr T. B. Johnson, who took Charles to ride with him. Thomas B. J. Frye dined with us— Mrs Thornton, Mrs Talbot and her daughter Mary spent part of the Evening here— Likewise Dr Thomas, who questioned me as to my health.— It is very indifferent—the fire which had risen to the crown of my head is falling back again upon my loins.

I attended the morning public worship at the second presbyterian church where a young man named Clark preached from John 3.3. “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, had witnessed or heard of the miracles performed by Jesus and from them had inferred as a certainty that he was a teacher come from God— He assigns expressly the miracles as the proof of the divine mission— Jesus then emphatically announces to him that except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God—but what is meant by being born again and what by seeing God— They are both figurative expressions applicable to the man who came to make the enquiries, and to the other men of that age and country— It was necessary that a jew, born under the Mosaic dispensation, and bred to the Levitical Law, should become a new creature, should set aside his whole system of religion and morals, before he could understand, adopt and practice upon that code of Laws, which the teacher come from God was then promulgating.— The answer to Nicodemus was purposely obscure and typical— Nicodemus did not understand it; or he affected to understand the words in their literal sense, and enquired how it was possible that an old man should be born again— In the sequel to the discourse Jesus declared that his meaning was all spiritual—that God had sent his only begotten son into the world to save the world, but that the world would not receive him—and although this was before the imprisonment of John the Baptist, Jesus distinctly intimated that his own life must be forfeited before his new system of religion could be fully unfolded— Now the whole tenour of this conference seems to me exclusively applicable to the condition of that age and country and to have no possible reference to times and places and men where the kingdom of God, or in other words the Christian system of religion and morals has been established for ages— This is not however the Calvinistic doctrine and Mr Clark taught us all that we must be born again before we could see the kingdom of God, without explaining to us how we were to be born again or what it was to see the kingdom of God— No definite idea was left upon the mind— Walter Hellen dined at our house, and Charles and I dined with Mr T B. Johnson— He dined at 3. O’Clock, and we sat with him at table, till between 8 and 9 in the Evening— We walked home, and found at our house Mr King the painter and Mary Cutts I was not entirely satisfied with the manner in which I had passed the day— "

He spoke of the state of Negotiations in relation to the Republic of Texas, of which there is a new project of annexation to these United States— I rode to the Capitol, and at 12 O’Clock, Noon the Speaker John White of Kentucky took the Chair, and the roll of members was called over by StatesAnswered to their names.— Henry Dodge was sworn in as Delegate from the Wiskonsin territory, and Francis Granger, as a member from the District in New-York which he formerly represented, and by which he has been re-elected since his short tour of duty as Postmaster General— The Secretary of the Senate Asbury Dickins came and announced that the Senate were assembled and ready to proceed to business— William Cost Johnson rose to request the Speaker not to appoint him on the Committee of public lands—and while he was up, offered a Resolution to adopt the rules of the 26th. Congress pro tempore— I had prepared a Resolution to adopt the rules as on force at the close of the 26th. Congress, except the 21st. rule; excluding abolition petitions and offered it as an amendment to Johnson’s.

Stanlys resolutions were rejected 84 to 87. mine by precisely the same numbers, and Wise immediately moved to adjourn, which was carried a quarter past 2.

My Son rode with me to the capitol; and I introduced him on the floor of the house, as a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts— Immediately after the speaker took the chair, and the reading of the Journal of yesterday, the President’s Son and Secretary, delivered his annual Message, which was read by the Clerk Matthew St. Clair Clark and took an hour and twenty minutes in the reading— Wise moved the printing of the usual number with the documents and ten thousand copies extra, of the Message alone. Sampson Mason enquired if the advertisement of the Congressional Globe added to the printed message in some of the copies distributed by the boys among the members was included in this motion to print— Wise took this up, as an attack upon the President, and a tart colloquy followed between him and Mason—but his motion for printing was adopted after being modified to the precedent of the last Session. Then W. Cost Johnson’s Resolution to adopt the Rules of the last Congress, till the report of the Committee of the last Session upon the rules shall be acted upon, a modification which he took up at last at the suggestion of Millard Fillmore was taken up— The Speaker said that the questions upon Stanly’s proposition and mine yesterday had not been taken under the previous question—but Johnson now moved the previous question, and it was carried by 101. votes and his resolution was adopted by yeas and nays 97 to 95. and the right of petition is again suppressed for the remainder of the present Congress.— An order passed for the appointment of the standing committees, and to fix the hour of daily meeting at 12.

Johnson came to my seat to introduce some friend, and joked about his victory for three or four days—but it is for the Congress; and bitterly does it try my temper— Winthrop and Saltonstall, have both applied to me, and strenuously urged my consent to act again as Chairman of the Committee of Manufactures—to witness the prostration of the whole manufacturing interest by the faction combined of Southern Slave-breeders, and the Northern democracy— I despair— At least for my own time— The day of redemption will come—but it is not destined for me— Charles was distressed by a Letter from Mrs Frothingham with information that his son Henry has been taken ill with the scarlet fever.— It damped the enjoyment of a numerous evening party, given for the entertainment of our children, before their departure to return home— There was Piano music and dancing till near midnight.

My Son this morning informed his wife of the letter that he received yesterday from Mrs Frothingham with the alarming intelligence that their third son Henry Brooks had been taken ill with the scarlet fever, and they immediately concluded to depart homeward this afternoon— They left us accordingly soon after dinner, and at half past 5. my Son, with his wife, his daughter Louisa Catherine, his infant son, Arthur and Mrs Kirk as Nurse, started in the railroad Cars for Baltimore— Charles went with me to the Capitol, hoping to receive another letter from Boston, but there was none— In the House a Resolution was adopted offered by Tillinghast for the appointment of a joint committee on the library— As the report of the Committee on the Rules was not to be considered till to-morrow Fillmore asked if the disposal to be made of the President’s Message, was to be taken up.— Clifford and the Speaker said that the first thing in order was the reception of petitions.— Robert L. Caruthers of Tennessee then called upon the house to decide upon a question between him and John B. Dawson, of Louisiana, as to the right to the seat occupied at the last Session by John Sergeant of Pennsylvania, who since the close of the Session has resigned. Caruthers stated that before the close of the Session he had exchanged Seats with Sergeant, and the names upon their respective tables had been transferred— Mr Dawson denying the right of a member who resigns to transfer his seat to another had during the recess erased the name of Caruthers from the table inserted his own in its place, and now claimed it as his own— Gordon of New-York moved that the seats should all be numbered, and drawn for to-morrow by lot—rejected. Charles Brown of Philadelphia moved a Resolution that whenever a member resigns his seat shall be reserved for his successor—rejected. Stanly moved a Resolution, that Caruthers is entitled to the Seat, by the right of exchange, and a prevailing usage— Taken by yeas and nays, and carriedtoI voted against it because there is no steady rule respecting the right to seats—and no usage sufficiently established and uniform to confer a right. I gave this as my reason to Stanly who came to my Seat to enquire of my motive for voting against his resolution— He thought I felt sore upon the vote adopting the gag-rule excluding petitions; and I do— But the mortification that I feel is not that of mere defeat—it is the disgrace and degradation of my country, trampling in the dust the first principles of human liberty— This is the iron that enters into my soul.— Mr Caleb Cushing came to my seat and said that he wished to have some conversation with me upon business, whereupon I agreed to receivin him at my house to-morrow morning at 9 O’Clock— I spent the Evening in assorting and entering upon a register the Petitions that I have received to present, and which will not be received.

                "text": "9. V. Thursday  Mr Caleb Cushing came this morning according to appointment, and said that the Speaker John White had expressed to him the wish that he would resign the station of Chairman of the Committee of foreign relations in my favour.— That having occupied that station at the last Session, it would have the appearance of personal hostility to him, if he should be now removed from it, and he therefore came now to ask my advice, what he should do— That the whigs were a party entirely broken up— That the portion of the whigs who attended the caucus at the close of the last Session, who issued the address against the President did not exceed fifty, but that there was no administration party in the house— Meaning to intimate that as a friend of the administration of John Tyler he felt bound to adhere to the station of chairman of the Committee of foreign relations— I said to him that it was a point upon which I was hardly competent to give him advice— That I had no desire to be chairman of the Committee of foreign relations, and had never directly or indirectly intimated such wish to the Speaker— That after most reluctantly serving ten years, as Chairman of the Committee of Manufactures, I had at the last Session requested the Speaker not to put me on that Committee— He said he would not and asked me if I had any objection to serving on the Committee of foreign relations— I said that should be as he pleased, and the next day, he Cushing was announced as Chairman of the Committee of foreign relations, and I of the Committee of Indian Affairs, more odious than that of Manufactures— The house had at my request excused me from serving on the Indian Committee, and I had been on no standing Committee throughout the Session— I should be perfectly satisfied with the same dispensation throughout the present Session.— As to his being chairman of the Committee of foreign relations, I must in candour say to him that after the rancorous hostility of his feelings against England, not only with reference to the Northeastern boundary question, but upon numerous other points on which I believed England more sinned against than sinning, I could not say that I had much confidence in the course of that Committee with him at its head.— He knew that my advice to Mr Webster to retain his place last September when all the other heads of Department resigned, was founded exclusively on the belief that Mr Websters signally conciliatory temper and disposition towards England was indispensably necessary to save us from a most disastrous and calamitous War, upon that wretched question about the State-right of New-York to hang M’Leod— That most fortunately that stimulant to instant war was removed, but the temper of the two Countries was still so embittered and exasperated that it would still require the most soothing spirit and the coolest blood to preserve the peace between them— That in the differences between Mr Tyler and the Harrison Cabinet I had taken no part; and had no feeling of hostility to the administration; but he knew that in advising Mr Webster to retain his office as Secretary of State I had expressly disclaimed all obligation or intention to defend Mr Tyler’s treatment of the Cabinet, or his executive measures during the late Session— I added that my personal feelings towards him Cushing had invariably been and still continued to be altogether friendly. That I had believed him to be uniformly friendly to me. (He said it was certainly so.) And that so strong and earnest had this feeling been that although there several points of policy of vital importance, upon which my opinions differed totally from those expressed by him, I had not on a single occasion manifested that difference in the house; nor sought any discussion with him in private— He said he regretted that I had not— And that he had not been aware of my differing from him excepting, in what I had lately said of the affair of the Caroline— I repeated that I had studiously avoided all altercation with him, from that overruling friendliness of disposition— That he could not but have observed that when he undertook to sanction and adopt the tariff compromise, and to speak not only for himself, but for the whole commonwealth, Governor Lincoln, openly and explicitly declared his dissent from that declaration; and that I said nothing—though I certainly differed from him, more widely even than Governor Lincoln. To all this Mr Cushing made no explanatory reply; but said he should not mention to the Speaker the substance of our conversation, but should be quiescent, and leave the Speaker to act as he may please— That is he clings to the chair of the committee, and compels the Speaker to appoint him— So be it. This morning, I found the house in Session.— Fillmore had offered Resolutions, to distribute the President’s Message among the Committees; but they were not yet appointed. Lawrence of Pennsylvania announced the death of his colleague Henry Black, Ogle’s successor and after the usual crape wearing resolutions, the house adjourned— I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer—saw Gales, Seaton, and Redwood Fisher. Met afterwards, Weems in the Street— Revd. Mr Clarke, and a young man named Howard came to request me to deliver a Lecture— "

At the commencement of the last Session of Congress, White the Speaker intended to place me as Chairman of the Committee of foreign relations—he gave me notice of that intention; and the next day appointed Cushing; at the special request of Daniel Webster— Cushing thought that inflammatory declamation against England, upon all possible topics was the short cut to popularity; and he speechified accordingly— It appears that Mr White is now again disposed to place me on the Committee of foreign relations.— I suppose he came yesterday with an expectation that I would authorise him to say to the Speaker that I wished him to be placed again as chairman of the Committee of foreign relations, or to ascertain whether I had any concert with the speaker on this occasion— At the house this morning Stanly told me, that Fillmore wanted to get an order for the appointment of select Committees, to enable the Speaker to appoint Cushing Chairman of the Committee on the Currency— Fillmore accomplished this purpose after much snarling debate about what the house should do— The report of the Committee on the rules was made the special order for yesterday and every day till decided upon; but now W. Cost Johnson moved to lay it on the table— Carried by yeas and nays 96. to 88.— Sundry motions were made to proceed to the choice of a chaplain—finally rejected by yeas and naystoSo of a motion to adjourn. Cave Johnson fretted and Clifford argufied against Fillmore’s resolution for the appointment of 3 select Committees, which they insisted was not in order. The speaker decided that it was— Cave appealed and the Speaker was sustained 113 to 81. Stanly moved the previous question— Wise asked him to withdraw it with a promise to renew it. Stanly declined. the second by tellers was 101 to 81. The question upon the select committee on finance was carried 113 to 83; and the two other committees without division— W Cost Johnson moved a select committee for the establishment of a National foundry.— Carried—adjourned at 2. I received a Letter from Harriet Welsh— Charles’s child Henry continued ill with the scarlet fever— I dined at the President’s— The company, Bayard, Bond, Miss Carter, Clark, Cross, Cushing, Dickens, Eastman, Fulton, Gilmer, Granger R.

King Churchill, set forth in his letter to me of 25. Novr. last—a pension stop’d because the privateer pension fund from which it was paid was exhausted—of Paul Draper, by Letter of 13. Novr last—and of Ebenezer Lovel of Kingston by Letter of 8. Novr last— Mr Edwards will report to me upon each of these claims. 2. The Navy Department. I read to the Secretary Abel P. Upshur—the letter from Horace H. Watson of 30. Novr last—soliciting a Midshipman’s warrant for his son of the same name—and I left it with the Secretary, together with the biographical notices of Marston Watson, by judge John Davis— Also a Letter from John B. Croning 30. Octr. last at New-York, soliciting a Midshipman’s warrant for himself— Mr Upshur said I was doubtless aware, that the Massachusetts and New-York portions of the Midshipmen’s station were full and over flowing. I was—but understanding that an increase of the navy was in contemplation, I supposed that an additional number of midshipman might very soon be appointed. He said recommend such an increase in advance of the building of the ships; for it would be worse than useless to build the ships and then have no officers to manage them— I spoke to him also in behalf of Mr Kavasales, who had been with me again this morning. Mr Upshur said his name was upon a list which he should send next Monday to the President for nomination to the Senate— He said it was strange that there was not a single application for a midshipman’s warrant from the State of Rhode-Island. 3. To the 4th. Auditor’s Office, where I left the claim of Ebenezer T. Fogg, Administrator of Howard Freeman, a coloured Seaman, who died on board the Ohio, for arrears of wages. and 4. to the War Department— Mr Spencer the Secretary is confined to his house by a cold— I saw Genl. Daniel Parker, chief clerk and Coll. Abert, of the Engineers—communicated to them the Letters of Baron Lederer, the Austrian Consul general to me and to Mr Poinsett, proposing to sell his collection of North-American Minerals, for the benefit of the National Institute of literature and Science— Coll. Abert judiciously remarked that the Institute had no funds— Visits from Mr and Mrs Tillinghast, Mr and Mrs Saltonstall and their two daughters, the two brothers Ingersoll, and in the evening Dr Thomas.

At the second presbyterian church this morning Mr Moore made the prayer, and Mr. Rich, the Minister of the Church in 4 1/2 Street preached from Luke 15.10— [“]There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.” Mr Rich is a native of Boston, and an orthodox calvinist of the straitest sect— He commented largely on the nature and causes of the joy in heaven over repenting sinners— It was joy in the presence of the Angels of God—not only their own joy, but the joy of God himself—joy distinctly felt and upon separate grounds, by each of the three persons of the Godhead—by the father by the son, and by the holy spirit.— This idea, for which there is no warrant—whatever in Scripture Mr Rich borrowed from a hymn of Watts—the 101st. of the first book; which he gave out to be sung— Like many other calvinistic quiddities, it bordered so closely up on the burlesque, that I could not for my life resist the recollection of Chesterfields profane and profligate song upon this passage— Mr Rich’s enquiry into the motives for joy in Heaven over one repenting sinner was little less ludicrous— He said it was because every repenting sinner, added to the multitudes of God’s blissful kingdom; and drew nearer the destruction of this Globe of earth, which must be intensely desired by the Angels—for they must consider it owing to its foul corruption the vilest of the heavenly orbs, and a mere blot on the face of creation. Mr Rich gave notice of several religious meetings to be held this week, and one, of the members and pew-holders of the Church next Tuesday evening at 7. O’Clock, for the election of a minister— After dinner, my Grand daughter Mary-Louisa went with me to St. John’s church, where Mr Hawley read the evening service for the 3d. Sunday in Advent, and Mr Henshaw of Philadelphia, preached from Luke 3.4. [“]As it is written in the book of the words of the Esaias the prophet, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 5. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth: 6. And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.” An advent Sermon— Mr Henshaw delivered the discourse with conscious eloquence, and with a careless facility of utterance as if he had been aware that it was an occasion for the pathetic— It left me cold. After church, I called to see Mrs Madison, but she was not at home, and I left a card. In the evening I received a Letter from Elizabeth C. Adams at Boston written last Friday, with accounts of the state of Charles’s child Henry far less favourable than those of the two preceding days from H. Welsh. [symbols]   "

She said Mrs Dana was here, with her father Mr Palmer, a presbyterian clergyman, who would be glad to be elected chaplain to the house— I said I had promised my vote for Mr Clark, but if he should not be chosen I would cheerfully vote for Mr Palmer— Mr Addison came as a candidate for the office of assistant door keeper to the house, in the place of John W.

Cornell, who presents him as a good whig (he believes.)— I had received a Letter informing me of his mission here as an agent of the democracy, to get a whig postmaster at Randolph removed, and a red hot democrat appointed in his place— He had also a petition from about 30 persons, for the appointment of a new post-office at the quarries in Quincy to be called the granite Post Office, with a recommendation of Justin Spear for Postmaster—and another application, he did not tell me from whom for the removal of D. French, from the present Post-Office at Quincy, on the ground that he keeps a tavern— Mr Tolman shewed me a Letter which he had written to the Postmaster General Charles A.

I found Mr R. C. Winthrop with the Postmaster General, and Willis Green came in while I was there— At the House the Speaker called for Petitions, beginning with Maine— I presented between fifty and sixty, almost all anti-slavery, and chiefly abolition petitions— More than half of them were excluded by the rule; but a part of several, and the whole of others were admissible.— Some were at my motion referred to the Committee on the judiciary and some to the Committee of foreign Affairs.— I moved the reference of a petition against the gag-rule to a select Committee— Meriwether moved to lay the motion on the table—rejected 92 to 87.— Rhett moved a call of the house. 192 answered— Meriwether then made a point of order that he meant to debate the reference and the petition must be laid over one day; and it was so.— Many others were laid over in the same way— When the call for petitions reached New-York, the House adjourned.— Mr Thompson introduced to me Mr Baldwin and another, who left with me, copy of a memorial to the Secretary of State upon a claim against Mexco.

Mr Radcliff came this morning and exhibited to me a commission, as confidential Agent of the State of the Isthmus, a new South-American Republic self-detached from that of New-Grenada— He says this Republic has existed as much as two years and has established a regular Constitution, not recognized by that of New Grenada, but independent of it de facto. Mr Radcliff asked my advice with regard to presenting himself to the President as the agent of this republic— I advised him to see the Secretary of State, and shew him his commission and credential letter—and desire him to take the decision of the President whether he will think proper to receive him— Kavasales came in, and I told him I had spoken for him to the Secretary of the Navy, who had promised me to send his name to the President for nomination this week— Mr Vowell is an old man from Alexandria—a claimant of indemnity for French spoliations prior to 1800. a claim which has been forty years before Congress, and is now one of the burdens of the Committee of foreign relations.— At the house Fillmore, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means moved for leave to the Committee to employ a Clerk—carried by yeas and naystoHe introduced also the bill making a partial appropriation for the expenses of the two houses, and the pay and Mileage of the members— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, John Pope in the Chair— The bill passed through that and all other stages in less than half an hour, and was sent to the Senate— Then the presentation of petitions was resumed at the State of New-York and went Southward through all the States— The Territories were not called— A great number of abolition petitions and remonstrances were presented in very diversified forms,—some excluded, some referred to Committees, and many laid over for debate. I gave notice personally to all the members of the Committee of foreign relations to meet at 11— O’Clock to morrow morning in the chamber of the Committee— I declined an invitation to a party this Evening at Mr W. W. Seaton’s. There was a meeting at 4 this afternoon in the Hall of the house of persons to form a National Society of Agriculture; I could not attend— Letter this evening from Harriet Welsh 1/2 past 11.

At 11. this morning I attended the first meeting for this Session of the Committee of Foreign Relations, in their chamber adjoining that of the Committee of Manufactures— The members present were Adams, Cushing, Everett, W. Cost Johnson, Granger, Gilmer, Hunter and Rhett— Absent Mr Proffit I proposed to keep minutes of the meetings, entering the name of each member present at every meeting which was agreed to—and to hold a regular meeting once a week on Tuesday morning’s at 10. O’Clock— I read the Letter from the Secretary of State and its 3 enclosure, respecting the hunter’s lodges on the Canadian frontier.— An objection was started that this subject had not been referred by the house to the Committee— The Chairman was instructed to move the house to refer to the Committee the two Messages from the President which had been referred to the Committee at the last Session, and not reported on by them.— Adjourned to Tuesday Morning. It was apparent that Everett and Granger were both averse to the revival of the Act of 10. March 1838. recommended by the President’s Message of 21. July last, and urged by the Letter of theinstt. from the Secretary of State— At the house the call for petitions was completed by the delegates from the three territories. David Levy from Florida Henry Dodge from Wiskonsin and A. C. Dodge from Ioway— The question upon the reference of the petitions laid over was then in order, but I consented to its postponement, until the house shall have passed on the Resolutions offered by Mr Fillmore, who moved to take them up at once, without going into committee of the whole and to distribute the several parts of the Message at once to the appropriate committees— Questions of conflicting jurisdictions immediately arose— Wise and Cushing were jealous of the Committee of Ways and Means, and Atherton commenced a dead set against the reference of the Tariff to the Committee of Manufactures.— Foster and Meriwether of Georgia, Smith and Wise of Virginia followed up the attack Irwin of Pennsylvania made a show of defence— At 3. John W. Jones took the floor and the house adjourned— I rode home— Mr Connell paid us an evening visit—deeply distressed at the presentment of N. Biddle, and others for fraud— Letters from Harriet Welsh, and from Mrs Ellen Brooks Tuesday Morning. The only prayer I can presume to offer, is for Christian Fortitude and Resignation to meet the impending divine will.   "

Read of Philadelphia called on me this morning; a young man of fine talents and splendid promised darkened in dim eclipse by the contamination of the Pennsylvania falsely called bank of the United States— He too, like Connell is under great alarm at the bills of indictment pending over the heads of Nicholas Biddle, and his accomplices—both Read and Connell are too deeply implicated in the transactions which have stamped with infamy the name of Biddle and the very existence of that bank— It is an awful example of the perversion of the moral sense, and the prostration of bright intellect effected by the unlimited trust of money. Mr Richard S. Coxe, came with Dr Baldwin and a Mr Parrott of Louisiana, claimants of indemnities against Mexico— Mr Coxe left with me a draught by him of a memorial to the Secretary of State remonstrating against the joint Commission upon the claims against Mexico, and all their proceedings.— And will call upon me again for advice— I had received a Letter from Royal Turner of Randolph enclosing a remonstrance to the Postmaster General, numerously signed against the removal of Mr Howard as Postmaster there— I took the enclosure to the general Post-Office, where I met Elisha Whittlesey and Philo C. Fuller— They informed me that Mr Wickliffe was attending a cabinet meeting at the President’s I left the remonstrance therefore in the hands of Mr Fuller— At the house, the unfinished business of yesterday came up. Fillmore’s Resolution to refer—so much of the President’s Message as relates to the Tariff to the Committee of Manufactures, with Atherton’s proposed amendment, to strike out the Committee of Manufactures and insert the Committee of Ways and Means— Discussed by John W. Jones, of Virginia, Hiram P. Hunt of New-York, Joseph M. Randolph of New Jersey, Joseph R. Ingersoll of Philadelphia, and Edward Stanley of North-Carolina, till half past two, when William Slade of Vermont took the floor, and the house adjourned— I have strong temptation to speak on the pending question, but distrust my own discretion— I fear I should probe this ulcer to the quick, and inflame, rather than heal the wound. Passed Midshipman Joseph H. Adams dined with us. A violent North-east storm, begun with rain, thunder and lightening continued with hail and gale, and closing with Snow, hard frost and clear sky arrested the mail this Evening from Boston, and allowed us a reprieve of a few hours more of prayer.

Saturday  Bogan was one of the workmen upon the public buildings, for whom I presented a petition to the house last January— He came now to enquire if I had the petition— It put me upon a search of an hour and a half, in which I found the minute of the petition, as entered when I presented it but not the petition itself. I had received a Letter from Eleazer Homer at Boston of the 13th. instt. stating that the papers relating to Peter McIntosh’s pension claim, which I had sent him, had been forwarded to the Commissioner of Pensions on the 15th. of Novr. and no answer had been received from him—so Mr Homer requests me to ascertain and report to him the cause of the delay— I called at the Pension-Office where the Commissioner Edwards informed me that Mr Homer’s Letter of 15. Novr had been answered on the 27th. he read to me, and afterwards sent me a copy of the answer—the claim is rejected as it had been in 1835—and Homer has shewn no rational ground for reviving it— I called at Mr D. D. Barnards lodgings, but he sent me word that he was not yet out of his chamber though much better— He has been absent from his seat in the house four days from indisposition— This afternoon Mr Leavitt, called on me with Mr Gates, member of the house from the State of New-York— They are alarmed at numerous indications of a design to revive the project of annexing Texas to the United States— They said there was a long article in the New-York Courier and Inquirer recommending it, by arguments addressed first to the abolitionists, and then to others— And they asked if anything could now be done to counteract this movement— I know of nothing, but to make it as soon and as extensively known as possible— There is apparently in this movement a concert of longstanding between Andrew Jackson, Samuel Houston recently elected for the second time President of Texas, and Santa Anna now re-instated as President of the Mexican Confederation; and that the project is to be consummated by a cession of Texas from the Mexican to the North American confederacy. The developements of this project are not yet sufficiently clear and explicit to know how to meet and counteract it— My old servant Giusta came this evening, raving distracted, and threatened with a brain fever— Talking in the most insane manner without a moment of cessation for upwards of an hour with me and then sulking two hours more in the kitchen. Mr Smith went and gave notice of his condition to his wife who sent his nephew after him; with whom he went home— Letter with the last gleam of expiring hope from Mrs Ellen Brooks. "

My poor Antoine came this morning, sobbing and sighing as if he would burst his heart, and imploring my forgiveness and pity— He had not slept a wink the whole night and his brain had been unceasingly running upon trinity, unity, God, 1. 2. 3. one in a ring, my motto of Toil and Trust, upon a ring; my advice to him and kind treatment of him on sundry occasions, and other meditative fantasies which have unsettled his mind. I endeavoured to sooth him without direct contradiction, and urged him to consult a physician, and take some composing medicine, to induce sleep, which he finally promised to do— Mrs John Adams and Mary Cutts, attended the service of Morning worship in the Hall of the house of Representatives, where the Revd. Septimus Tustin, the chaplain of the Senate preached from Revelation 22.5. first clause of the verse— “And there shall be no night there.”— The sermon was short; and not so impressive as the text— A region of eternal day, opened a field for a description of Heaven well suited to eloquent declamation— But in the promise of Heaven there can be nothing specific. To beings of flesh and blood, eternal day, is not identical with eternal felicity— The vicissitudes of day and night are more congenial to the mortal nature of man than the glare of eternal daylight—but the how, as well as the where of eternal, uninterrupted unalloyed happiness is as inconceivable to the mind as it is contrary to the earthly experience of man— Mr and Mrs Pope were of the auditory in the hall, and after the service we paid them a visit at their lodgings—at a Mr Hill’s in the house which was built and occupied as a temporary location for the two houses of Congress, after the combustion of the former Capitol by the British in August 1814. and before its re-edification— Mr and Mrs Walter Coles were also there— Mrs Pope is the third wife of Mr John Pope, the member of the house. His second wife was my wife’s Sister Eliza Johnson. She bore him two daughters. Florida, who died at the age of 14. and Elizabeth who married a person named Cocke, and died leaving two children, a boy; and a girl named Mary now in her eighth year, a fine child now here with them, and whom we saw. Mrs Cutts dined with us and she and Mary-Louisa went with me after dinner to St. John’s Church— Mr Hawley read the evening prayer omitting the first lesson, for the 4th. Sunday in Advent and preached from Hebrews 5.9. And being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.— Visit to Mrs Madison. Visit from J. P. Todd.

Davis of Plymouth, recommending a Genl. King for Postmaster at Abington in the place of Elihu Hobart, resigned, for illness. W. S.

Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Relations, at ten this Morning— Present all the members except Caleb Cushing— The first subject taken up, was the reference by the house, of the parts of the President’s annual message relating to the controversy with Great Britain, upon the right of search, and to the foreign Affairs generally. Mr Everett who has long been a member of the Committee observed that the practice had always been to abstain from all interference with the action of the Executive upon matters pending in negotiation, unless at the instance of the Executive himself.— This was precisely the course that I was desirous of pursuing— Mr Gilmer and the Southern members of the Committee acquiesced in it, and relieved me for the present from the burden of sharp and heavy discussions. We then took up references of private claims— A petition of a widow Bronaugh, upon which after deliberation, the Chairman was directed to move the house that the Committee be discharged from the further consideration of the subject, and that it be referred to the Committee on the judiciary— The Petition of Mrs Alphonsa Blake daughter of William Carmichael came next. There was a report of the Committee, at a former Session against the claim; and a minority report, signed by Cushing and Everett in its favour— I very earnestly recommended it to the favour of the Committee and proposed referring it to Mr Everett for a new report, which was voted— Everett said the practice had been for the chairman to charge each member of the committee with any particular subject at his discretion— I told him he might if he pleased take it as a charge direct from me— The claims on France prior to 1800 were postponed Rhett said the Legislature of South-Carolina had instructed the members from that State to vote for that claim— But he had no faith in the doctrine of obedience to Legislative instructions, though R. M. T. Hunter might have Hunter answered only by a laugh— At Noon the Committee adjourned till next Tuesday— In the house the unfinished business; the tariff, the manufactures and the Ways and Means, occupied the day.— Sollers, Linn, Rayner, W. Butler of South-Carolina, and Meriwether worried and wearied the house till near 3, when T. F. Marshall took the floor, and they adjourned. Mrs Smith and Mrs John Adams dined and spent the day at Mr T. B.

I called this morning at the general Post-Office with a letter from Wilkes Wood, judge of Probate, for the County of Plymouth; endorsed by Philander Washburn Branch Harlow and Seth Sprague junr. about the establishment of a new Post Office and the discontinuance of an old one in Middleborough. The Letter referred to a petition of Martin Keith and others already in the Office, for the establishment of the new Office— Mr Wickliffe was not at his post. I called successively on Mr Whittlesey and Mr Philo C. Fuller, but the petition of Martin Keith was not to be found— I was requested in judge Wood’s letter to confer with Mr Borden on the subject— Middleborough being within his district. I spoke of it to him in the house, and he promised to call at the general Post-Office, and make them find Keith’s petition— At the house, after prayer by Mr Tustin, several members slip’d in petitions till Weller called for the orders of the day. Cowen gave notice of a long rigmarole bill to modify the recent bankrupt law—and Briggs gave notice of a bill to reduce postages and abolish the franking privilege.— Neither of these was received, but as Marshall was rising to address the house, Barton of Virginia, a shallow and hot headed person gave notice that he would move an amendment of the 34th. rule—which is that when two members rise to speak at the same time the Speaker shall decide between them— Barton grossly insulted the Speaker for having given the floor yesterday to T. F. Marshall, when Barton it seems had risen and claimed the floor at the same time— And he said his motion would be to transfer the power in such cases from the Speaker to the house— Garret Davis called him to order. The Speaker said every member had already a right of appeal from the decision of the Speaker to the house and Marshall said he had offered to yield the floor to Barton who declined to take it— Taliaferro, afterwards announced that the whole matter had arisen from mutual misunderstanding between Barton and the Speaker, which had been explained and adjusted, and no more was to be said about it.— Marshall made a beautiful speech of an hour and a half in favour of the manufacturing interest, and Rhett a ranting one against it. Atherton then took the floor, and the house adjourned— No letter this evening from Boston— Hope and prayer may yet not cease. "

                "text": "23. V. Thursday  I had received a Letter from William Wright of Boston, enquiring of the present condition of his petition presented at the second Session of the 26th. Congress, for an investigation of a settlement made by the Van Buren Administration, with the Commonwealth’s Bank at Boston— It was referred when presented to a select Committee of 5 members, of whom W. K. Bond of Ohio was Chairman— That Committee though continued through the second Session of that Congress were never permitted to report. I had the papers found this morning in the clerks office, and saw that of the Committee of the 26th. Congress, only two of the five members are members of the present Congress Hiland Hall and John H. Brockway, and I took the papers to Mr Hall, and requested him to call them up and move their reference to a select Committee; but he declined— Brockway did the same; and I was obliged to make the motion myself; requesting that I might not be placed on the Committee myself.— My motion for the reference was adopted— I had the papers on the petition of Leonard Hammond andDexter, also referred under a general resolution of the house to the Committee of Claims.— A number of other petitions and resolutions were smuggled in before the order of the day was regularly called and then Atherton of New Hampshire made a crabbed speech, he can make no other, of an hour and a half, against the manufactures; followed by Reynolds of Illinois, a coarse, vulgar, ignorant, cunning, knavish democrat who has been Governor of that State, and is a standing favourite of the democracy, his buffoonery keeps him afloat— Arnold of Tennessee replied to them both, and played at cut and thrust with them somewhat in their own style.— Arnold is a bold, honest, warm-hearted and hot-headed whig, born down by the weight of Jackson’s name and influence in the State—too fair and candid for the Slave-breeders, and rather too vehement for the timid and time-serving abolitionists of the North— When he finished Weller of Ohio took the floor, and the house adjourned over to Monday; which Cushing had seized on an unguarded moment of the house to move, and had been carried by the Speaker’s hardness of hearing to the call for yeas and nays.— There had been hard frost last night; and there was a glare of ice in the streets this morning—the chill of the atmosphere relaxed throughout the day till the evening closed with floods of rain— I had been all day brooding over anxious expectation of Letters from Boston; three days of dubious cheering having been followed by one, of inauspicious interval.— The letter came; not from Charles which had been promised; but from Harriet Welsh—a report of two days—the first deeply discouraging—the second faintly reviving hope, but too clearly foreshowing the fatal close.

V:30— Friday  Dr. Baldwin came this morning and took back his protest against the Convention of indemnities, with Mexico, and against all the proceedings of the joint Commission under it now sitting in this City— The Convention itself, and all the proceedings of the Commissioners, are of so very extraordinary a character that I cannot resist a strong suspicion that it was intended by the Van Buren administration, not to obtain indemnification for citizens of the United States upon Mexico, but to keep open the sore, and breed a war with Mexico, as machinery for the annexation of Texas to the United States— There is not a step in the whole series of transactions, which has a tendency to the satisfaction, or even to the adjustment of the claims— The convention itself is a mockery— The commission under it, an imposture— I have received two pamphlets, one of charges against the two Mexican Commissioners Don Joaquin Velasquez de Leon, and Don Pedro Fernandez del Castillo, by Orazio de Attellis Santagelo, styling himself a citizen of the United States, and the other, by the same person containing a statement of facts, presented to the President of the United States relating to the man’s claim on the Government of Mexico. The claim is of a Neapolitan Marquis turned into a North American Democrat, of damages for having been twice banished from Mexico, for setting up periodical journals in that city and preaching party politics. Dr. Baldwin’s claims I have not yet been able to examine— Captain Morgan of the Ordnance Department brought me the manuscript report to the Secretary of War of the examination of the condition of the Springfield armoury, which had already been shewn to me at Boston by major Ripley. Gossiping morning visit from Coll. Thomas, recently returned from a long excursion into the State of Missouri. He says the people there are unanimously and intensely desirous of making Tom Benton President of the United States; but there is not a man in the State who would trust him with ten dollars— I called at the lodgings of Speaker White and of Mr Clay; but neither of them was visible— Mr Clay is confined to his chamber, by indisposition— Call at the Clerk’s Office H.R.U.S. but neither the Clerk, nor the Speaker, nor Burch was there— Thomas B. J. Frye dined with us— Towards evening Mr Belcher brought me a letter from Mr P. S. Duponceau of Philadelphia. Mr Belcher comes with Memorials from Boston, New-York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, for Astronomical observations to fix the longitudes of those Cities— No letter from Boston— "

This is among Christians of many denominations a festive day; and although born and bred to the creed of the puritans which excluded all consecrations of particular anniversary days to religious celebration, I have from my youth up, been always inclined to make exception of this and Easter, day. More than once however in the course of my life the circumstances of the times have saddened the days which the remembrance of the birth and resurrection of the Saviour would have filled with joy— So has it been this Season. The approach of Christmas has been embittered by the long suspense, from the day when our dear children left us to this, hanging over the fate of his lovely boy—every day has been a day of anguish, and every night a night of fainting hope and momentary relief from awful expectation to learn that the child was gone. The mail from Boston due last Night, did not arrive till this day at Noon— It brought a Letter from Mr Peter C. Brooks, of Wednesday Morning, of feeble and precarious general hope, with which I suffered myself to be elated beyond all reason, and enjoyed a day of delusion still cherished by Letters one day later, of Thursday morning, from the father and mother of the dear agonizing child— They too were indulging hope against symptoms of the deepest alarm— To be prepared for the will of God, in resignation or in joy, is the only prayer that I can address to the throne of Heaven; and to say in humility of Soul thy will be done. My wife attended divine service, and partook of the communion at St. John’s Church— I called to see Mr Caleb Cushing, and Mr Charles J Ingersoll, who lodge three doors west of my house—but Mr Ingersoll went yesterday to Philadelphia, and Mr Cushing was out. I then called on Mr Barnard, my neighbour on the other side, who has been absent from his seat in the house these ten days, severely indisposed, but now on the recovery.— We had some conversation upon the state of politics, but I find him unusually reserved as indeed are almost all the members, with whom I converse— I ought perhaps to be so myself but I was not.— The only visitor I had was Mr Penrose with whom my acquaintance is very slight.— Joseph H. Adams, and Miss Cutts dined with us— I have been writing tardy Letters of acknowledgment J. L. Kerr and Eugene A. Vail for books received last Summer— "

[“]Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience, the race that is set before us.” Mr Clark is a young man with a clear strong voice, steeped in Calvinism to the lips, with the rusticity of deportment, dress, and stoop of a fresh country graduate of a yankee college, the type of whose pronunciation is measurable by the incessant repetition of the name of Gaud— He appears however to have captivated the worshipers of the second presbyterian church, in whose bosoms he seems to have infused a new portion of zeal. Besides the ordinary services of the Lord’s day he has set on foot a course of lectures, most of which are to be delivered by himself, and some for variety by others—He gave notice of several of these lectures, four of which are upon Bunyan’s pilgrim’s progress, and also that he should repeat at 7 O’Clock this evening a sermon upon the last judgment, which he delivered last Sunday evening. His morning sermon this day contained some scanty notices of the character and ceremonial of the antient races, to which the figurative language of the apostle, in this text alludes— After church we had as morning visitors Mr Winthrop with Dr Holmes from Boston, which place he left last Wednesday— He saw that morning Dr Bigelow, who charged him to say to us, that he had hopes of the recovery of our dear grand child, whose most unfavourable symptom then was a total want of appetite— We had received last Night, one day later when this most fearful symptom still continued and abashes all the hopes with reasonable expectation, which the abatement of other fatal symptoms might encourage— Mrs Thornton called in also before dinner— In the afternoon, at St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley preached from Isaiah 4.5. [“]And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by Night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.—” He had read evening prayers for the first Sunday after Christmas— It is somewhat curious that Mr Hawley seems to have a special impulse for taking his texts from the prophet Isaiah— We had no letter this evening from Boston Let me yield to hope that the silence forebodes not evil tidings.

V:15 Monday  Mr Leavitt brought me a New-York evangelist a Newspaper of which he said he was formerly the editor— It contained the protest made at New-Orleans of Zephaniah C Gifford, acting Master, and of the Officers and crew of the American brig Creole a Slave-trader, bound from Norfolk Virginia, to New-Orleans with a cargo of tobacco, and 135 slaves— On Sunday the 7th. of November at 9. PM, the cargo mutinied, and after a fight in which one Slave trader and one mutineer were killed, and several others on both sides were wounded, the mutineers prevailed, and compelled the white crew to navigate the vessel into Nassau New Providence—where 19 of the self emancipated cargo were arrested and imprisoned upon charges of mutiny and murder, and the rest were received and landed as free; except five who refused their freedom, and returned to the brig, and were landed at New-Orleans— This is a remarkable event, and will be followed by momentous consequences— Mr Babbit is one of the claimants of indemnity for French spoliations prior to the year 1800. He came to hurry me as chairman of the Committee of foreign Affairs to immediate action, by reporting a bill for the satisfaction of those claims— Mr Cushing has taken special charge of that concern—but the claimants are afraid that his patronage will do them more harm than good.— I called at the Department of State, and met Dr Baldwin in the entry— I asked Mr Webster to forward with his next despatches a Letter to Eugene A. Vail, which he took and promised to forward— I enquired when the answers were to be expected to two calls from the House of Representatives— One of 12. February last for information concerning our relations with Hayti—and one of 19. June last, for aggregate returns of the Census.— He knew nothing about either of them— Mr Markoe could give no account of the Hayti call— Weaver was not at the Office, and Stubbs could tell nothing about the aggregates. Stubbs afterwards came to me at the house with a message from the Secretary to say that a copy of the aggregate returns had been sent to me at Quincy, and another at the same time to the clerk of the house— Afterwards Stubbs came again and said that the aggregates had not been sent to the Clerk, and enquired if a copy would answer next Friday— At the House, Weller of Ohio, Christopher H Williams of Tennessee, and Charles Hudson of Massachusetts occupied the day about the Tariff reference.

I was there at 3 minutes past 10 by the Muse’s Clock in the house— I found Cushing already there— Everett and Granger came in within 5 minutes after— We waited then a full hour, when Profitt came in and we took up, sundry private claims— Those of Mrs Meade, and Alexander Hammet were referred to Mr Everett and Mr Rhett who came in about half past 11— A claim of Captain Ridgely was much discussed, and vehemently opposed, especially by Rhett; and the decision postponed— Rhett gave notice that he should at the next Meeting of the Committee move to take up, so much of the President’s Message as relates to the British claim to the right of search of American vessels on the coast of Africa— At the last meeting of the Committee Rhett being the only member absent, the Committee had without dissenting voice agreed to take no action upon the President’s message, unless upon special call from the house or the executive.— Rhett was now very impatient— I requested him to reduce his motion to writing, which he did. I think the majority of the Committee will be against his motion, but never was an occasion when I had more need of accurate perception, thorough knowledge, cool and dispassionate judgment, inflexible firmness, intrepid perseverance, imperturbable serenity, and courtesy of deportment than now. That I have eternal right on my side is certain— Let me never for an instant forget that [“]He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty: and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.” My cause is the Peace of my country, and the rights of human nature— In the house Hudson finished his excellent speech in favour of a protective tariff— He was followed by Payne of Alabama, Edmund Burke and Ira A. Eastman both of New Hampshire, all anti-protective— Burke read his Speech, in so low a tone of voice that he was heard by scarcely any one, but it was retaliatory upon Arnold, and drew a ludicrous parallel between the States of New-Hampshire, and of Tennessee, especially East-Tennessee, from which Arnold comes. Eastman is a sprightly speaker, and belaboured Arnold, with equal venom and more power and effect— He did not finish. The house adjourned about 3.

O’Clock this morning, and at that time he came with a letter of introduction from Alden Bradford— This Captain Hatch is the brother of George M Hatch, also Master of an American Vessel who in July last had the misfortune to cause the death of a riotous, drunken, and insulting American sailor at Rotterdam in Holland, who belonged to another vessel, and was forcing his way on board of Hatch’s vessels in defiance of his orders— For this homicide Captain Hatch was tried by the Court of criminal jurisdiction of that country, and sentenced to have a sword swayed over his head, and to five years imprisonment— The other Masters of American vessels at Rotterdam, sympathising sailor fashion with their countryman called in a tone rather peremptory upon the American Chargé d’Affaires Bleecker to interpose, and claim jurisdiction exclusive for the American Courts. Mr. Bleecker declining to assert this pretension did interpose by solicitation for a pardon, but without success. Captain W. B. Hatch has now brought with him; and presented to the Secretary of State numerous petitions, praying the President of the United States for his interposition to obtain the discharge of the prisoner.— And he came to me for advice— I told him that we could not question the jurisdiction of the dutch court—but the President might efficaciously interpose by solicitation for pardon— He said his brother’s wife had thought of going to solicit for him, and he had proposed this by all means. to go with her. I advised this by all means; and offered any service that I could render Call at the Navy Department, about Hart— Minott and Ebenezer Thayer.

I had finished before breakfast my record of yesterday, and hoped to have time for doing something, that is writing something before the time of meeting in the house—but some troublesome household cares intervened, and the remnant of hours slipped away in hearing Mr Smith read in the National Intelligencer, the report of yesterday’s debate in the Senate on Walter Forward, Secretary of the Treasury’s board of exchequer— Buchanan and Calhoun gave it no quarter— Preston in a tone of subdued nullification hoped something would be done— Tallmadge and Rives, are for modifying it. Benton declared War against it upon its first reading, and Mangum of North-Carolina this day gave it the coup de grace— Never since this Government has existed, was President so totally deserted— It is the same in the house— Yesterday, Millard Fillmore chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means announced that he had that morning received notice, that there was a deficit in the treasury of 260000 dollars, for which immediate provision must be made, or the Treasury must suspend payments— He moved therefore to take up a bill which he had introduced some days since, extending the loan— No— Eastman insisted upon the floor, and the house could not take up Fillmore’s bill— He repeated the effort this day, with no better success— By sitting to-morrow the house might have made the necessary provision; but a motion was made to adjourn over to Monday, and carried by yeas and nays 86 to 82. both parties thus uniting to display this utter indifference, not only to the credit of the Treasury and the administration, but to the honour and justice of the Country— Mr Meriwether had finished his Southern whig moderate, candid anti-tariff and anti-manufacturing speech; and had been admirably answered by Robert C. Winthrop, whose promise as an Orator and debater in the house is of the highest order. W. Cost Johnson took the floor and the house adjourned at 3. After dinner Mr George B. Ironside—brought me a Letter of recommendation from George Sweeny— He is the son of an Irish schoolmaster whom some twenty years since I appointed to a clerkship in the Department of State, and who died four or five years after— The Son now wants a similar place, and he asked me for a recommendatory letter to Mr Webster which I declined, as I give no such letters. Horace Everett lent me a manuscript report which he had prepared two years ago on the China question, but which was not presented— He agrees with me Letter from S. D. Heap, Consul at Tunis. The Bey has abolished Slavery in his dominions— "

Close of the year  Mr Whittlesey called this morning, and introduced a boy, about twelve years old named William M’Pherson Washington, son of one of the Clerks in the general Post-Office; he had a new splendid Album with the name only of John Tyler entered in it and he asked me for mine, which I gave with an admonition to the boy from Solomon. The ways of Wisdom are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace— There is a passion for Albums and Autographs spreading all over the country like the yellow fever or the Cholera. Mr Kavasales came to inform me, that the President had sent to the Senate last week a nomination of 5. chaplains in the Navy, upon which his name was the last— He has some apprehension that its confirmation may be resisted in the Senate, and he solicited my influence with any of the Senators whom I may see before their next Meeting. Mr Hassler came and informed me that his report in answer to a Resolution of the House, of the last Session moved by Caleb Cushing (25 June 1841) relating to the Coast Survey, was sent in yesterday and he wished me to move that it should be printed; and that a certain number of copies should be furnished to him as had been done on a former occasion— Cushing’s Resolution was moved and carried in a spirit of hostility to Hassler— Nor will he be satisfied by the report— I called at the Department of State and had a three hours conversation with the Secretary upon foreign Affairs.— I received at the Department a Session pamphlet copy of the Acts of Congress at each of the last three Sessions. Upon the State of the Canadian frontier he gave me some information and expressed a strong desire for the revival of the act of 10. March 1838— The calls of the house for documents respecting our relations with Hayti and for the aggregates of the census have not yet been, but will be answered— There is no regular communication, of the Department, with China— The Consul, Snow, is in this Country. A man named Delano, sometimes writes from Macao. No late information from thence— None from Mexico.— They know not even how Santa Anna comes to be at the head of the Government there— Nor what to do with the Commission of indemnity now sitting here under the Convention of 11— April 1839— I enquired if Andrew Stevenson had ever informed the department of his Letters to Commodore Hull in March last, advising him to run away, and make the best of his way home, to escape from the clutches of the British Lion— He did in June last communicate copies of those Letters, written in March— But the President thought it best not not to communicate to Congress that portion of Mr Stevensons diplomatic atchievements. Mr Webster himself thought that the other part of the Negotiations might have been permitted to slumber in the same oblivion—he considered Stevenson as having surrendered the question at issue on the right of search, by assuming untenable ground against it. This was my own opinion— He remarked on the extra ordinary circumstance of the correspondence between Stevenson, and Lord Palmerston, when they were in substance, both out of office, and under no responsibility.— The term of Stevenson’s mission having actually expired, and the Ministry of which Palmerston was a member having been dismissed while the correspondence was in progress— Mr Webster says that the Secretary of the Navy Upshur is a very considerable man, and utterly disapproves Stevenson’s pretensions about the right of search— After full and free conversation I found every particle of opinion avowed by Mr Webster on this controversy about the right of search perfectly concurring with my own. I told him that my own disposition with regard to all questions in negotiation with Great-Britain was essentially pacific, and especially averse to every thing irritating in form or offensive in language; and against every thing of War tendency, excepting the boundary question; and upon that we should be inflexible— To this he made no reply.— I meant to give him fair warning—and then added that my most earnest desire as chairman of the Committee of foreign affairs was to move in perfect harmony with the Executive administration, and to give to its measures my cordial support— He received this overture with cold hearted thanks; but the great difficulties of Mr Webster are not with the foreign Affairs; nor with any thing in that Department— Money, public and private is the insuperable obstacle to his successful progress, and will finally at no distant day turn him out upon the world, and prove the ruin of this administration as it did of the last.  I spent this last evening of the year in my own chamber, writing a letter of humble hope, gratulation and comfort to my dear children, and in fervent prayer for them and their offspring, and for my wife and the family around me—including my neighbours, relatives, friends—my country, and the world of mankind— The last moments of the departing year were cheered with a letter from Harriet Welsh, written on Wednesday morning and encouraging the expectation so long and so nearly believed beyond redemption extinct that the dear child Henry, will yet soon be convalescent, and spared for useful life on earth, by the merciful dispensation of God.— "
