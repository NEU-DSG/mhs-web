Nourse to deposit, an order from the Speaker of the House for four hundred dollars, which I took in gold and deposited with three hundred dolls in Bills at the Bank of Metropolis upon which I drew a check of 501.25 payable to J. J. Nourse for City Corporation 6. per cent with a brokerage of one quarter of one per cent. Thence I attended at the House A person by the name of Isaac Cole had been here with a subscription paper for the Building of a Methodist Episcopal Church near Dover Mills Baltimore County— I requested him to call here to-morrow— At the House Edwin H. Ewing from Tennessee, elected in the place of Joseph H. Peyton deceased took his seat and was introduced to me by his Colleague—Milton Brown— Francis A. Cunningham—offered a Resolution with a preamble declaring the Negotiation with Great Britain relating to Oregon Territory terminated and that it is the imperative duty of Congress to adopt immediately such measures as will fully protect our Citizens whom now do or may hereafter inhabit that Country and effectually maintain our just title to the whole of the Country of Oregon— McKay Chairman of the Committee of Ways and means objected to the introduction of this Resolution Henly and Wentworth moved a suspension of the Rules to receive this Resolution which was refused by yeas and nays 73. to 89. Soon after a Question arose as to the day appointed for the consideration of the Bill from the Committees on the Territories for extending our Jurisdiction over the whole Territory of Oregon— Garrett Davis moved a suspension of the Rule to introduce a resolution that the Committee of the whole House on the State of the Union should be discharged from the consideration of that Bill and its ten sections be recommitted to seven of the standing Committees of the House— The House refused the suspension of the Rules—a Debate followed concerning the publication of the tenth volume of the Laws. Reports from Committees were called Hugh A. Haralson Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs Reported a Bill to provide for the organization of two Regiments of Riflery—he moved its referrence to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union and made the special order for next Tuesday— A long Debate followed, at the close of which I took a part in it by a Speech which I fear gave satisfaction to no part of the House when I finished James J. Faran of Ohio moved the suspension of the Rules to offer a Resolution but the House without hearing it read immediately adjourned. W. H. Seward Late Governor of New York came to me at my seat and inquired if I should be at home this evening. I said I should. he promised to call on me and did so with Mr. Robinson who now reports the proceedings of the House for the New York Tribune— I had a long conversation with them in which Mr. Seward declared his full approbation of my speech in the House but some doubt whether it would meet the concurrence of the Whig Party— In coming down the stairs from the House Mr. John W. Houston a Whig member of the State of Delaware had introduced himself to me and told me that he concurred entirely with the sentiments which I had just delivered— This is probably the last great movement of my political Life—it will pass through a fierly ordeal the result of which as concerns myself I leave to the great disposal of events— "

January 1846—  Mr. Thomas Sandford, was here again this morning an Old Man prosecuting a Claim the origin of which goes back to the last year of the last Century— He has been here once before last week, and now came with sundry Documents in support of his Claim he belongs to Fall river in the state of Massachusetts and in the year 1834 a Petition was presented to the House from him by Tristam Burgess of Rhode-Island referred first to Committee on Commerce and afterwards to the Committee on Ways and Means who reported against it in 1836. Among the Documents which he now produces is a Letter from Commodore Isaac Hull which may possibly have the effect of obtaining a favorable dicision on his Claim— I promised him therefore to call up his old Petition and have it again referred to the Committee of Ways and means—which I accordingly did. At the House which I found in session the Committees were called for Reports and sundry Bills of which notice had previously been given were introduced by individual members after which, on motion of Hannibal Hamlin Chairman of Committee of Elections the House took up with two reports from the majority and minority five to four on the contested election between Edward C. Cabill and William. H. Brockinbro. for the seat of the Representative from Florida Mr. Cabill made some explanation concerning the reports in the newspapers of the former proceedings of the House upon this case Harper of Ohio a minority member of the Committee of Elections, moved a postponement of the case till tomorrow but was resisted by Hamlin, of Maine who insisted upon taking up the case which was carried 95 to 83. A. H. Chapman of Virginia moved and it was resolved that William H Brockinbro who contests he seat of E. C. Cabell have leave to be heard at the Bar of the House The majority and and minority reports of the Committee of Elections were read, with several unsuccessful attempts to suspend the reading. The majority Report concluded with two Resolutions first, that Cabell was not entitled to his seat and that Brokenbro is. the minority report reverses these positions— Hamlin, Chipman, and SJones debated the first majority Resolution till the adjournment of the House at a quarter past three oclock.— There is much excitement by the news yesterday received of the breaking up of the Peal Ministry in England, and the prospect of a new Ministry headed by Lord John Russell— "

There was a fall of snow last night and this morning about six inches deep— In the course of the morning the weather cleared up after some rain and a light frost— At the House Howell Cobb of Georgia was appointed on the Committee on Accounts in the place of William Taylor deceased. George W. Jones of Tennessee offered a Resolution calling on the Secretary of the Treasury, for a return of impost Duties received in the year ending 30th. June last with a parrelelstatement of what would have been the proceeds of Duties on the same Articles and all others at an ad valorem rate. Laid over for Debate— Sundry communications from the Navy Department were laid by the Speaker before the House The Florida contested Election was resumed and the Resolutions of the majority Report of the Committee debated chiefly between the members of the Committee till a motion was made by Alexander D. Simms of South Carolina to strike out the Resolution and recommit the case to the Committee to take further evidence relating to the Election I enquired of the Speaker whether the House had not yesterday Resolved that the contestant Brockenbro should be heard in support of his Claim? the Speaker answered that he was. I then suggested that it might be proper to hear the Parties upon the case as it now stood and if that should leave the House unable to decide the Question the motion of Mr. Simms might then be agreed to— Mr. Cabell then moved to suspend the hour rule in favor of Mr. Brockenbro, and Mr. Dobbin moved that it be also suspended in behalf of Mr. Cabell— I objected that the Rule could not apply to Mr. Brockenbro not being admitted as a member of the House nor of course to Mr. Cabell his competitor but was answered that at the last Congress it was decided by the House that the Rule should be applied to both the Parties in the contest between John W. Jones and John M. Botts. The Question was then taken upon the motion to suspend the Rule and lost by yeas and nays 89. to 74. not two thirds. The House then adjourned. There was a Bridal Party in the day time to the house of Mr. F. P. Blair six miles from the City and they went in the evening including my Grandaughter to the Drawing-Room at the Presidents House.

It was close upon midnight last evening when I came home from the Party invited by Mr. Joseph R Ingersoll at the House of Mr. Markoe There had been a luxuriant supper and a numerous assemblage— Mr. James Thompson member of the House from Pennsylvania disappointed by his Hackney Coachman took a seat with me in my Carriage and Fuller took him to his lodgings at Mrs. Hamilton’s in Pennsylvania Avenue— This morning Mr. John Otis of West Barnstable was here proposing still to remain here some weeks in the prosecution of further Claims of the Heirs of his brother William Otis deceased— He inquired if he would stand any chance to obtain employment as a Clerk to any of the Committees of either House of Congress I answered that none of the Committees of the House were allowed to employ Clerks unless by especial note of the House which was very rarely granted. I believed that the Committees of the Senate were more freely indulged. I could give him no encouragement to hope for employment by any of the Committees of the House. He said he was acquainted with none of the Senators except Mr. Webster and with him very slightly— At the House, the resolution offered yesterday by George W. Jones of Tennessee calling on the Secretary of the Treasury for the Amount of Duties imported in the last year to the 30th. June 1845. and the equivalent by an ad valorem duty was adopted without opposition. The Speaker laid before the House a Letter from B. B. French representing his embarassment with regard to the execution of an Order of the House of the 13th. instt. requiring him to distribute among the Members of the present House the copies of Captain Fremont’s Report which an Order of the last House of Representatives had directed should be distributed among it. Members of the 28. Congress— Thereupon James Thompson of Penn moved a Resolution that the Clerk forewith distribute the report of Fremonts expedition acending to the Order of the House of the 13th. January inst a Debate followed whether by the Resolution of the last House there was not vested in the members of the last House a property in the Documents directed to be distributed which it was not competent to the present House to take away and appropriate to themselves— Joseph R. Ingersoll and Schenk of Ohio opposed Thompson’s resolution and Schenck moved as an Amendment to it that five thousand extra Copies of Fremont’s report be printed, for the use of the members of this House and that the Resolution of the 13 instant be rescinded. Cullen Sawtelle of Maine enquired of the Clerk if he had information or knowledge that any member of the last Congress had sold to a Bookseller in Washington Books which he had received in distribution by an Order of the House. Rathburne objected to this Question as not in order The Speaker said he had made enquiry of the Clerk who had answered that he had no such information Sawtelle moved a previous Question Joseph Morris of Ohio moved to lay the subject on the table which was refused The previous Question was carried Schenck Amendment was rejected by yeas and 76 to 106 and Thompsons Resolution was carried also by yeas and nays 94 to 80— Sawtelle then moved a Resolution for the appointment of a Committee of five with power to send for persons and papers to enquire whether any members or members of the 28 Congress had sold Fremonts Report or any other remnent ordered by Congress to be distributed and to Report to the House the name or names of such traders and the facts respecting the sales. The Resolution was extended to the case of members of all other former Congresses and to other Doc and was adopted without opposition. The Florida contested election was then resumed Mr. Cabell the sitting member made two proposals first that the House should take the Question without further Debate and secondly if the contestant should not agree to that they should go back to the People of Florida to settle the contest by a new election both of which Mr. Brockenbrough declined and delivered his own Argument in support of his Claim Mr. Cabell took the floor and the House adjourned by yeas and nays 108 to 64— Mrs. Maury Mr. Healey and Mr. Dubourjal spent part of the evening here— "

Further evidence appears of the flinching of the Polk Administration upon the Oregon Controversy with Great Britain— In the Union newspaper of last Tuesday—there was an Article, strongly intimating, that if a proposition should be made on the part of Great Britain to take theof the 49. degree of Latitude as the Boundary to the Pacific Ocean, describing it as the offer made by me it might now be accepted. In the Debate in the Senate on Wednesday this Article was referred to, by Mr. Miller a Senator from New Jersey as very clearly indicating that Mr. Polk has no fear of war to arise from this Question Edward. A. Hannagan Senator from Indiana rose and averred upon his responsibility that this Article had never been seen by President Polk before its publication and was not approved by him— The Union of this day admits the fact, but repeats the opinion expressed in the original Article— At ten o’clock this morning I attended a meeting of the Select Commitee on the Smithsonian Bequest present six Members—Owen, Adams, Jenkins, Sims—Davis, Wilmot—absent Marsh of Vermont who afterwards told me that it was because he had forgotten the time of the Meeting—Some progress very little was made in the discussion of Mr. Owen’s Bill, in the Sixth Section provision is made for a superintendant to take charge of the ground, Buildings and property belonging to the Institution—and also for the Appointment of a Professor of Agriculture, Horticulture and Rural economy and also for a distribution among the people of the Union of Fruits, Plants, Seeds and Vegetables to be collected by this Superintendent with the Professor, and Gardiners, practical Agriculturists, and Labourers to be hired from time to time by him, as may be necessary— I moved to strike out this Section, which consider as a cumbersome expensive, and useless burden upon the Institution— It was connected also with a further project, declared in the seventh Section, for the appointment of a Normal Branch of the Institution, with an indefinite number of professors of common School and other scientific Instruction—all which I proposed to expunge from the Bill— The discussion was desultory, and before taking the Question upon it some Amendments of detail to the Sixth Section were proposed and debated until the meeting of the House when the Committee adjourned to next Friday. At the House the Committees were called for Reports—many of which were made, but none of any material importance. Stephens of Georgia presented resolutions from that state claiming re-imbursements for sundry expenses incurred by that State in the late Wars with the Indians, commonly called the Florida War. Committee of the Whole on State of the Union—Tibbatts in the Chair. Joseph P. Hoge of Galena Illinois and William Wick of Indianapolis Illinois in two successive hour Speeches supported the giving of the Notice and took to task the latter with merciless sarcasm, the contrast of bullying and of sneaking off the South Carolina politicians with John C. Calhoun at their head. He ridiculed their clamours about war, though he admitted, that War might terminate in the result of this Controversy and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee took the floor but the Bill was laid aside and a Bill from the Senate to establish certain post roads in the State of Texas was taken up— Erastus. D. Culver of Greenwich New York, made an hour Speech against the Bill on the grounds of unconstitutionality insisting that the Annexation of Texas to this Union by mere Act of Congress was UnConstitutional null and void and would be so decided he had no doubt by the Supreme Court of the United States if the Question could be brought before them. He reviewed with severe censure all the proceedings of the Democratic Party and of the Administration in the rise, progress and consummation of that iniquitous measure— He adverted to the deception practised upon the People of the North at the Baltimore Convention by the substitution of James K Polk for Martin Van Buren as the candidate of the Party for the Presidency of the United States, and in the adoption of two Resolutions one for the Annexation of Texas and the other declaring the right of the United States to the whole of Oregon to 54.40— as clear and unquestionable and now after completing the Annexation of Texas falling back and manifesting the design to abandon if not the whole a large portion of Oregon even to the mouth of Columbia river with the free navigation of it— Culver was several times called to order by southern members—and especially in a very insulting manner by McConnell of Alabama but the Chairman steadily and resolutely declared him in order to the great annoyance of the interrupting members who dared not however take an appeal from his decisions— Culver finished his Speech without losing his temper and McConnell sputtered a few sentences in reply to him of personal insult of which he took no notice— The Committee of the Whole then reported the Bill and with the help of the Previous Question it was passed without Amendment and without further opposition. Walter Hellen went to an evening Party at the House of Gov. Marcy the Secretary of War, and we were amused by the reading of a review of the Life of Capt Kidd in a number of Littell’s Living Age "

Mr. Hoyt was here this morning, with a friend of his from Philadelphia named Hopkins— Mr. Hoyt left with me a minute of several Claims at the Pension Office, which I took there and left with Mr. Edwards the Commissioner requesting him to examine them and report to me his decision, upon them—which he promised— Mr. Brainard came and requested me to sit for a Daguerreotype likeness at Plumbes Gallery Concert Hall in the Pennsylvania Avenue where I promised to go at eleven o’clock tomorrow morning— At the House Robert McClelland, of Michigan presented resolutions of the Legislature of that State declaring the right of the United States to the Oregon Territory, to Latitude 54–40— Laid on the Table and ordered to be printed— A Message was received from the President, in answer to a Call of the 19th. December last, for copies of correspondence between this Government and Great Britain within the last two years, in relation to the Ashburton Treaty, free navigation of the river St John’s and the disputed Territory fund, with copies of Documents from the Department of State. Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs— Reports were also received from the Secretary of the Treasury, with returns of importations and Impost Duties and from Secretary of War, with returns of Militia— The Committees were called for Reports, many of which were made—chiefly upon Private Claims, favourable and adverse. John H. McHenry of Kentucky reported from the Committee on the District of Columbia, a Bill to enlarge the powers of the several Orphans Courts of the District— It related to the distribution of Property. Joshua R. Giddings of Ohio moved an Amendment, of an additional Section declaring, that Slaves shall no longer be deemed in Law to be property—within the District of Columbia and was supporting, his Amendment by beginning an Argument, when McHenry objected to the Amendment, as not in order for irrelevancy— The Speaker a pro-slavery representative from the free state of Indiana buckled close to the Slave mongers, decided, that the Amendment was irrelevant, and therefore, not in Order— Giddings appealed from this decision—and began an Argument in support of his Appeal— William. M. Treadway of Virginia, inquired if the appeal was debatable. The Speaker answered that it was— Richard Brodhead, from Easton, Pennsylvania moved to lay the Appeal on the Table—which was carried— This decision undoubtedly wrong, serves but to show the transcendent power here exercised, over the House, by the Slave Representation, of the South— The bill was passed— George Rathbun, reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, a Resolution, calling on the Secretaries of War and the Navy, to report whether any of the Officers, Military or Naval, were employed as Clerks in the Department or otherwise and receiving double compensations and the Amount of such payments if made— He reported also a resolution, declaring that no alteration in the naturalization laws is necessary, for the preservation of the rights, interests, and morals of the People; or for guarding the Ballot Box, against every improper influence— This resolution, directed point blank, against the resolutions of the Legislature of Massachusetts, which had been referred, to the Judiciary Committee and was itself referred, to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Rathbun moved that five thousand extra copies of the Report should be printed which was laid over for a day— Lynn Boyd, from the Committee on the Territories moved to be discharged from the consideration of a large number of the Memorials, and Remonstrances, against the annexation of Texas, and that they be laid on the Table—which was done— Robert Smith, of Illinois, from the Committee on Roads and Canals, reported, a Bill for completing the Cumberland road through Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and to Jefferson City, Missouri— Referred, to the Committee of the whole, on the State of the Union— Morgan L. Martin, delegate from the Wisconsin Territory, presented, a paper, signed by himself, and Augustus C. Dodge, Delegate from the Territory of Iowa, requesting leave to record on the Journals of the House, their suffrage, in favor of the Resolution of notice, adopted yesterday, by the House, which was agreed to— A Message was received from the President, with the Annual returns from the Mints. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Richard Brodhead in the Chair, on the Appropriation Bill, for Fortifications, amounting to one million of dollars, which after some small Debate, was laid aside, to be reported to the House. The Bill of Appropriations for Pensions, was taken up next— This gave rise to a long Debate, upon an Amendment, proposed by Tibbatts, of Ky without deciding which, the Committee rose, and reported the Fortification Bill, which was passed, and the House at half past three o’clock adjourned— Mr. Hoyt was here in the evening, to inquire if I had received answers from the Commissioner of Pensions, in the cases, which I had submitted to him from Mr. Hoyt’s minutes— I had not. Mr. Hoyt is to leave the City tomorrow. "

And have never been received, by the Government here, nor has any satisfactory account, been given, how the money, has disappeared— Dr. Baldwin, told me, that an Executive Document, of the last Congress, No 144. contains, a Report upon the subject, disclosing, some extraordinary facts, relating to it— But he explicitly charged, Waddy Thompson, then Envoy Extraordinary, and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States, in Mexico, with having, in Concert, with the Agent Voss embezzled the money, and divided it between them— I told Dr. Baldwin, that I could hardly hear, and still less credit, such a statement, that if there was any foundation for it, I considered it incumbent; upon the Administration, of this Government itself, to investigate it, to the bottom, and if not to recover the money, at least to expose, and if possible, to punish the delinquents— I am afraid that I can apologise, to my conscience, for failing, in the performance, of my own duties on this subject, only, by the prostration of my strength, and the disability, of decaying age— As I was entering my carriage, to go to the House, I met at the door, Mr. Heman Lincoln, with a missionary by the name of—and a young Chinees Man, with whom, I had not time for an interview— At the House, on motion of Archibald Atkinson of Virginia, the Committee of Naval Affairs, was instructed to inquire into the expediency, of having completed, and fitted for service, the ship of the Line, New-York, and the Frigate St. Lawrence, now in the stocks, at Gosport, in Virginia— James. C. Dobbin of North Carolina, from the Committee of Elections, reported in favor of John Runk—as a Member of the House from New Jersey, against the memorial, of Isaac. G. Farlee, concluding with the Resolution, that Runk, is entitled to his Seat. Lucien. B. Chase of Tennessee, made a minority report, from the same Committee, against Runk—and in favor of Farlee, both the Reports, were laid on the Table, and ordered to be printed— John. P. Martin of Kentucky, from the Committee, on Milage, reported a Bill, prohibiting the allowance of travelling Fees, for any Senator, for attendance, at any called Executive Session of the Senate, unless, for actual travel— This Bill, roused a sharp debate and the House, manifested, a large majority, for driving it through at once, but the morning hour expired.— and the House went into Committee of the whole, on the State of the Union upon the Indian, Appropriation Bill, John. R. J. Daniell in the Chair— Amendments were moved, by Hugh White of New York, and Martin delegate from Wisconsin, which were reported to the House, and one by Thomasson of Kentucky, against the Choctaw Academy, which was rejected; and the Bill was passed by yeas and nays 150. to 10—of which last number, I was one— Dr. John M. Thomas, was here this evening, and prescribed, for a new complaint, of inflamatory symptoms, in my Legs— "

A practise of evil tendency, creeping into the House— Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, moved to reconsider the vote, to lay on the Table, the Bill, to grant the Patent, to Dr. Charles. G. Page, an Officer, in the Patent Office— This motion was postponed for future consideration. This was the day for the presentation of Petitions, but the House went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union on yeas and nays 106 to 67. Thomas Smith of Illinois, in the Chair—and took up the River and Harbour Bill— Felix G. McConnell, after breathing a blast against the Bill itself, moved to lay it aside, and take up another—which Motion, was rejected— The Amount of the Appropriation, is $1,348,450—besides an indefinit Sum, for the purchase, of the Louisville and Portland Canal— McConnell, moved to strike out, the first Section of the Bill, and sputtered a speech, of about 10. minutes, when his Motion was rejected.— Robert. B. Rhett, moved to strike out, all after the enacting clause, and delivered a diatribe, against the whole system of internal improvements, to which, Thomasson of Kentucky replied— Crosier of Tennessee, proposed an Amendment, an appropriation of $250,000. to complete the Canal; round the Muscle Shoals, of the Tennessee River— He complained, that the North Western Members, of the Committee of Commerce, had lavished too much Money, upon the Lakes, and that a grant, made several years ago of four hundred thousand Acres of Land, to the State of Alabama, to dig a Canal, round the Muscle Shoals, had not accomplished the object— Houston and Chapman of Alabama expatiated, upon the faithful application of that grant, but admitted to be sure, that it had not accomplished its purpose, but McConnell charged the State, with gross mis-management, and waste of that Fund— Schenck of Ohio, made an hour speech, in favor of the Bill, animadverting to the composition of the Committee of Commerce, and defending them, against the censure of Crosier— He complained also, that the Annual Message of the President, had totally omitted all recommendation, not only of Public improvement, but even of Harbour defences.— The Committee rose, and the Speaker communicated to the House, reports, from the Post Office, Navy, and Patent Office Departments: The Report from the Commissioner of Patents, was ordered to be printed; referred to the Committee on Patents. It comes this year from Edmund Burke, late a member of Congress from New Hampshire, appointed in the place of Henry L. Ellsworth, removed, for extraordinary service in the Department. The House adjourned soon after three— In the evening at 7. o’clock, I attended at the Convention, for the observance of the Sabbath,—In the vestry of the 1st. Presbyterian Church in 4 1/2 street— Of which the Revd. Mr. Sprole, is the Minister— My neighbour Albion. K. Parris, went with me.— There were nearly two hundred persons present— Delegates, from the Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, and Episcopalian Churches, in the District of Columbia, but no Roman Catholics, Quakers, nor Unitarians— Mr, Parris, was chosen Chairman, and the Committee appointed, for organizing the Meeting— They reported a list of Officers, nominating me as President, with several vice-Presidents, and Secretaries, the first of whom was Matthew St. Clair Clarke. A business Committee was appointed, who retired and Reported, rules for the proceedings, and fifteen Resolutions, for discussion— They were immediately debated, and with some Amendments adopted, and agreed to be reported, to an adjourned Meeting of the Convention, in the Church at 10. o’clock tomorrow morning— It was past 10. o’clock, when with Mr. Parris, I returned home.

T. Hunter, Chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, of a Bill to retrocede, the County of Alexandria, to the State of Virginia. Another Bill reported by William. W. Paine of Alabama, from the same Committee, was to repeal an Act requiring one of the Judges of the Circuit Court, of the District of Columbia to reside in Alexandria. This Bill was read three times and passed without opposition. Alexander Ramsay of Pennsylvania, reported from the Committee on Military Affairs, a Bill for the commencement of Fortifications, at New Bedford Mass. Isaac E. Holmes, Chairman of the Committee of Naval Affairs, reported a Bill, to reduce into one Act, the several Acts, concerning Naval Pensions, and to repeal some others. He reported also from the Committee on the Rules, a new one, that upon Bills making Appropriations of money, for internal improvements, a separate vote of the House, may be taken, upon each item separately— Tibbatt’s moved to lay it on the Table, which was rejected, by yeas and nays, 69. to 95—and the Rule was adopted 98. to 75. and finally passed 106. to 71.— A motion to reconsider was rejected 86. to 95. The River and Harbour Appropriation Bill, was taken up in Committee of the Whole, on the state of the Union, Thomas Smith of Indiana in the Chair. W. W.

At ten o’clock this morning, I attended a Meeting of the Select Committee on the Smithsonian Bequest, present Owen, Chairman, Adams, Simms, Jenkins, Marsh, and Jefferson Davis—absent Wilmot.— The Chairman, conformably to the order, adopted at the last meeting had prepared a Report, to be submitted with the Bill, to the House— It contained a statement, of the embezzlement of the Fund, by investing it in the stocks of the states of Arkansas, Illinois, and Michigan— I had moved, to have this statement made and provided for in the Bill—but excepting Mr. Marsh, no other member of the Committee, would consent to it. They were unwilling to uncover the nakedness of the States— They consented however with reluctance, to have it made in the report, which Mr. Owen had rather awkwardly done, with an expression of the opinion of the Committee, that there would be, no ultimate loss, to the United States, of the Funds thus invested— I moved to strike out of the Report, this expression of confidence, which I could not honestly avow— It was accordingly struck out—leaving a bare statement of the Facts, to be made— The Chairman, was directed, in presenting the Report, and Bill, to move that they should be printed, and made the special order of the Day, for the second Tuesday, in April— The Committees upon this subject, of the House, have heretofore, been unanimous, in the Reports— All which have been made by me— But the House, has never been prevailed upon, to take them into consideration— In this Committee, no two members, excepting Mr. March, and myself, have agreed in opinion, with regard to the future management of the Fund— I doubt, if there will be more harmony in the House, for never was there, a benevolent and charitable purpose, more unfortunately endowed, than that of James Smithson, intrusted, to the good faith, and intelligence, of the North American Congress—  In the House, John S. Chipman of Michigan, a member of the Committee of Elections, moved to take up their Reports, upon the New Jersey contested election— The House preferred to go, into Committee of the whole, on Private Bills, by virtue of the rule that on the first and fourth Friday, of each month, this being the fourth, the calendar of Private Bills, shall be called over, and those to the passage of which no objection is made, shall be first considered, and disposed of— Thirteen Bills were thus reported to the House, and passed; and a Bill granting a Pension, to Orris Crosby, was objected to, by Simms, of South Carolina— Whereupon Wentworth of Illinois, if his objection should be persisted in, he would object, to every other Bill which should be called up— Which he accordingly did, till a debate arose, which finally compelled the Committee to rise— Hannibal Hamlin, moved to go into Committee again—but without success— Stephen Douglass of Illinois, Chairman of the Committee on Territories, moved to go into Committee of the whole, on the State of the Union, upon the Oregon Territorial Bill— Which motion also failed— After the receipt of several Communications from the Executive Departments, Cobb of Georgia, moved to go again into Committee of the Whole on private Bills, but on taking the Question, there was no Quorum, voting, and the House adjourned— Mr. John.

Simms, of the fourth Congressional District of South Carolina, in the form of a personal explanation, assigned his reasons, for objecting yesterday, against the passage of the Bill, for the relief of Orris. Crosby, which arrested the progress of the Committee of the whole, in clearing out the Private Calendar— John Wentworth of Illinois, who had yesterday, objected to every Bill, after that in favor of Crosby, and thereby, broken up the Committee of the Whole, made a counter explanation and an Argument for the Bill, in favor of Crosby. But there was no Question, before the House, and the two personal explanations ended in smoke— Edmund. W. Hubard presented resolutions, from the Legislature of Virginia, requiring of Congress, to provide by law, for the satisfaction, of all Virginia Military Land warrants for Revolutionary service, now unsatisfied. Referred to the Committee on Public Lands—numerous Reports were received from the Committees— Alexander Harper of Ohio, presented resolutions of the Legislature of that state, against any increase, of the rights of postage— Referred to the Committee on Post Offices, and Post Roads— Robert. Dale. Owen, Chairman of the Select Committee, on the Smithsonian Bequest, presented a Report and Bill, as a substitute of that, which he had introduced; and moved, that the Report be printed— That the substitute be referred to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, and printed separately, in the form of a Rule, and be made a special order of the day of the second Tuesday, in April next— A division of the Question was called, upon which Mr. Owen. urged the propriety, and necessity, for the credit of the Country to make it a special Order, for a not distant day— The Resolution was carried, by a vote of more than two thirds—and the specific assignment, for discussing the Bill, was made. The House then went into Committee of the whole, on Private Business— Rathbun of New York in the Chair— The Bill, granting commutation, of half pay, to the legal Representatives, of Colonel William Grayson, of the Revolutionary Army, was again debated. Speeches in its favor, were made by James. A. Seddon, Thomas H Bayly, Joseph Johnson of Virginia, and Garrett Davis of Kentucky and against it, by Henry. S. Clarke, of North Carolina— Samuel Gordon of New York moved to lay the Bill aside, to be reported to the House, with a recommendation that it do not pass— I moved to strike out those words, but the Chairman thought, it was sufficient, to strike out the word not— The Question was taken by Tellers, and carried 64 to 60— The Bill was reported accordingly, and the House adjourned without taking the Question upon it— I rode to and from the Capitol on account of the snow— "

                "text": "1. V.—  The snow continued, with little intermission, through the last night, and this day— I rode, not without difficulty, to the second Presbyterian Church, on New York Avenue— Where were assembled, the present Minister, Mr. Matthew Hale. Smith, about twenty men and two women— He performed the usual morning service, according to the forms of the Presbyterian Church, and preached a short Sermon from Hebrews. 6.18. “That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation who have fled, for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope, set before us. 19. Which hope, we have as an anchor of the Soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth, into that within the veil”— This Discourse scarcely gave me an opportunity to judge, of the character and power of Mr. Smith as a pulpit orator. What I have seen of him, has given me a very favorable, opinion of him, as a man— He gave notice that owing to the inclemency of the weather, the Church would not be open, for Public Worship, this afternoon— But that there would be a service in it, on Wednesday evening— The Storm continued so severe, that I did not attempt to attend any Church, after dinner;—but employed the time in reading a Poem, on the Immortality of the Soul—Canto first— This work, in manuscript, was sent to me, by its Author, through the hands of Mr. Brinkerhoff—of Ohio—with a request, that I would read, and give my opinion of it— It was said to be written by the Author of a volume, given to me last Spring, by Mr. Knox, on the Philosophy of the plan of Salvation— I have intended, and promised Mr. Knox to read it—but have not yet performed the promise— The Poem is in the form of blank verse—in the construction of which the Author, is very unskilful— It is accompanied with Notes, more voluminous, than the Poem itself, and consists, in the first Canto, of a series of inquires, to ascertain, what is the Soul— The second Canto, which I had not time this day to read, is intitled, “The work of the Soul”—and the notes, beginning with the doctrine of Plato, dive into all the mysteries, which belong to that, incomprehensible subject— I dread to approach it, and never enter upon it, without remembering, the reprobate spirits in the Paradise lost—“Who find no end, in wandering mazes lost”— "

This morning we retrieved the arrears, of this Diary—and I then attended at the House— I found them in Session and Felix G. Mc Connell, had made an explanation about his Speech, two or three days since, assailing, the Legislature, of his own State for mis-managment and waste, of the proceeds of the Sale of 400,000. acres of Land, granted by Congress, to aid in the construction, of a Canal, round the Muscle Shoals, of the Tennessee river— The Speaker said this was the day for calling the states and Territories, for resolutions, commencing with the Territory of Iowa, and going upwards to the state of Maine—but James. C. Dobbin of North Carolina called up a Report, of the Committee of Elections, in the contest for the seat of John Runk as a member from New Jersey— John Wentworth of Illinois, urged the call for resolutions, it being the first time, during the present Session, that it was to commence from the west but the House chose to postpone the call for resolutions, and to take up the contested election.— The report of the majority closed with a resolution, that Isaac. G. Farlee, is not entitled to a Seat, in this House, as a representative from the state of New Jersey— Hannibal Hamlin, from the minority of the Committee of elections, moved to strike out all after the word resolved, and insert that John Runk, is not entitled to a seat upon this floor; that Isaac. G. Farlee, having received a majority, of the legal votes of the legally qualified voters, of the third Congressional District of New Jersey, is entitled to his Seat, upon this floor— Farlee was admitted to a seat on the floor, with the privilege to speak, in support of his claim. The Reports of the majority and minority of the Committee of elections were read— It appeared, that John Runk, was declared to have been elected, by a majority, of 16. votes, but Farlee represented, that this nominal majority was obtained, by the votes of 36. Students, at the Theological Seminary at Princeton, and of 5. Students, at the College, at the same place— The Question then was whether the votes of the students, were by the Laws of New Jersey, legal, and valid the debate was maintained, by Harper and Dobbin, in favor of the students, and resisted by Hamlin and Chipman— All members of the Committee of elections— I found it so dull and tedious, that I left my Seat, and went into the Senate Chamber where I heard a Speech of Sydney Breese, Senator from the State of Illinois upon the Oregon Question, in favor of giving the notice, of termination, to the Convention of 1827. and stubborn, in support of the right to the parallel of Latitude 54–40. The hour rule, of the House, has not been adopted, in the Senate— Soon after three, I returned to the House, where Chipman of Michigan was still speaking, but stopt immediately, for a motion to adjourn, which was carried— I rode to and from the Capitol— The heaviest, of this, and of many winters, subsided, this afternoon, and began to clear off cold— "

February 1819. and finally ratified on the 22d. of February 1821. It related to contested Land Titles, in that region of Country claimed by us, as ceded in the Louisiana Treaty of 1803, and by Spain, as not included in that Treaty— That is, west Florida, east of the Mississippi to the Perdido— These Land titles, have been in litigation from the time of the conclusion of the Florida Treaty, and now, a statement of my recollection is requested, as to an understanding, between the negotiaters of the Treaty Don Luis De Onis and myself, at the time. I told this gentleman, that I should very readily, give my recollections upon the subject, but they would have no sort of bearing, for or against any claims to land titles— That the Treaty must of course speak for itself, and at the distance, of 27. years, I could have no confidence, in my own memory, upon points so critical, in the conduct of the negotiation, I could say at once, that Mr. Onis and myself, had commenced the negotiation, by discarding all previous controversy, respecting the right of Jurisdiction, of either party, in the disputed Territory— The King of Spain, had made up his mind, to cede to the United States, all his claims, and rights, to the whole of it, and we considered it altogether useless, to debate any further concerning the previous title, to it— Mr.left for me, a Memorial to the Committee of private Land claims, of the House of Representatives, presented in April 1838. by Richard S. Cox, and Theodore H. McCaleb Council for the Petitioners, with sundry Documents annexed, which I am to examine— I took to the Pension Office for the examination of the Commissioner a Letter from Elijah Clark Esqr. with a return certificate of Pension due to the Heirs of Betty Wheat, and a claim of Jonathan Sargent—and then went to the House, where the Speaker had laid before the House, a report from the Clerk, estimating the cost; of supplying the Reporters with the printed Documents, for the remainder of this Session at about three hundred dollars. The contested election, from New Jersey, between John Runk the sitting member and Isaac. G. Farlee, was resumed. John S. Chipman of Michigan, finished his speech, in favor of Farlee, and was followed, by Timothy Jenkins, of the 20th. Congressional District of New York, on the same side. They were answered, by E. D. Culver, of New York, Robert Toombs of Georgia, and Robert. C. Schenck, of Ohio—with an overwhelming superiority of talent and of Argument, on the other side— John. W. Tibbatts, of Kentucky moved the Previous Question. and passed four o’clock the House adjourned— Mr. Richard D. Cutts, and his sister Mary, were here this evening— My wife was quite unwell and confined to her bed— "

Farlee is not entitled, to a Seat in this House, as a representative from the State of New Jersey, but they did not report, that the sitting member, was.— Hannibal Hamlin, from the minority of the Committee, moved to strike out, that Farlee is not entitled to a seat in the House, and to insert, that John Runk is not entitled to a Seat on this floor— That Isaac G. Farlee having received a majority of the legal votes, of the legally qualified voters, of the third Congressional District of New Jersey is entitled to a Seat on this floor— Yancey inquired, if the Question could not be divided, the Speaker answered, that by a positive rule of the House, a motion to strike out and insert, was indivisible— Morse of Louisiana, then asked to be excused from voting in as much as he could vote that Runk was not entitled to the Seat but not that Farlee was— The first Question was upon Hamlin’s amendment, which was rejected by yeas and nays, 76. to 112—then on the Resolution reported by the majority of the Committee, that Farlee is not entitled to the Seat, which was carried 119. to 66— Hamlin then moved that John Runk, is not entitled to a Seat, in this House, and called the previous Question, and yet, attempted to make a Speech— Hopkins of Virginia, moved to lay the whole subject on the Table, which was rejected 93. to 99— The previous Question was then carried, and Hamlin’s motion, that John Runk, is not entitled to his Seat, was lost, 96. to 96—the Speaker deciding the tie, by voting in the negative— Bayly of Virginia then said; that he had agreed with his Colleague Pendleton, called away by urgent business to Baltimore this morning, that if his Bayly’s vote, should turn the scale, he would not give it, Yet he did vote against Runk, and thereby, made the tie— He said he should not have voted if he had known, that the vote would be so close, and this is a sample, of what Mr. Bayly holds to be the obligation of good Faith— But for the decision of the Speaker his vote would have turned the scale, but the promise itself, was unwarrantable— William Sawyer of Ohio complained, of a Letter published in the New York Tribune, purporting to be, from the Reporter a Letter writer, of that Paper, on the Floor of the House The Clerk read Letter, which was, extremely abusive, and scurrilous, upon Sawyer and one or two other members— Brinkerhoff of Ohio moved, that the Reporters and Letter writers, for the New York Tribune (without naming them) be expelled from this House, and he moved the Previous Question— Washington Hunt of New York moved to lay the resolution on the Table.— Winthrop, raised a question of order, and denied the right of the House, to expel the Reporters— The Speaker overruled the point of order— Garrett Davis, moved to refer the subject to a select Committee— Hilliard moved to adjourn— Hunt withdrew his motion to lay on the Table, and the vote by yeas and nays to expel the Reporters and Letter writers for the New York Tribune, was carried 119. to 48. Robinson, is one of them, and was named as well as the other by Sawyer, but not in the Resolution itself— The House adjourned about four o’clock— Revd. Mr. M. Brown formerly President of the Jefferson College, at Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, was here this evening and left with me, a Letter, soliciting, a contribution, in behalf, of that Institution, which I visited, in November 1843. on my return from Cincinnati— Mr. Brown, has since resigned, the Office of President of that College, and was succeeded, by the Revd. Robertof Baltimore— I do not feel a call, to comply, with a request for a contribution, believing, that the College, ought to support itself, or be supported, by the people of Pennsylvania— My wife was ill, and confined all this day to her bed— "

He seems to think that there is a deep plot involved in this publication, but knows as little as I do, what it is. He insinuates that it concerns, a legitimate descendant from Charles Edward once the Jacobite pretender— at the House, when I took my seat, the House was proceeding, in a call, occasioned by a motion, of David. S. Reid, to reconsider, the vote of yesterday deciding the contested election from New Jersey in favour of John Runk, the sitting member, by the casting vote, of the Speaker— Immediately after I took my seat a motion was made to suspend further proceedings on the Call for which I voted— Winthrop came to my seat and told me, that the motion to reconsider was a concerted measure, to reverse the decision, under the voluntary absence, of some Democratic members to secure, a reversal of the decision, without changing their votes—and thus turning Runk out of his seat. The majority of the House refused to suspend the call till a number equal to that, of the yesterday vote, was returned, whereupon Mr. Reid, withdrew his motion to reconsider, and Runk holds his Seat— Dromgole from the Committee Ways and Means, reported sundry articles of Amendment to the proposed sub-Treasury Bill—referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— McKay, Chairman of the same Committee reported the Annual Post Office appropriation Bill— Sundry Reports, on Private Claims, were received and Armistead Burt, of South Carolina reported from the Committee on Military Affairs, a Bill to found a Military Asylum, for the relief and support of Invalid Soldiers of the Army— Isaac E. Holmes of South Carolina, reported from the Committee on Naval Affairs a call on the Secretary of the Navy, for retrenchments in that Department; which was adopted— The River and Harbor Bill, was resumed, and Tibbatts moved a resolution, for closing the Debate on that subject, which resolution was laid on the Table, by yeas and nays 88. to 33. Afterwards, the House went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on this Bill Howell Cobb of Georgia in the Chair. McKay, moved to postpone it and take up an Appropriation Bill but the Chairman stated that Hudson was entitled to the floor, and McKay’s motion was not considered— Hudson had been called to Order for discussing the Tariff, in the last Debate on this Bill— The Chairman had pronounced him, in order, and an Appeal had been taken from that decision— It was now confirmed by the Committee and Hudson finished his hour speech— John Pettit of Indiana, followed, in his speech of an hour, abusive enough, upon Hudson, but in support of the Bill. Frederick P. Stanton of Memphis, Tennessee, then took the floor, the Committee rose, and the House adjourned— We had evening visits from the Revd. Dr. John Codman of Dorchester, and from Mr. George Sykes, a member of the House from New Jersey, with three of his friends from that State— My wife continues ill, and unable to leave her bed— "

At the House, the reading of the Journal of yesterday was dispensed with— James McDowell late Governor of Virginia, appeared and took his seat, as a Member of the House—from the eleventh Congressional district, of Virginia, elected, in the place of William Taylor, deceased.— James. C. Dobbin, of North Carolina, moved a resolution, to pay, out of the fund for pay and mileage for members, milage and pay, to Isaac. G. Farlee from the commencement of the Session, to the 4th. inst while he was contesting the Seat of John Runk— This motion, gave rise, to several rather whimsical incidents— It has been usual, in cases of contested elections by vote of the House, to allow pay and mileage, to the persons contesting, who fail, in establishing their right to the Seat—but these decisions, have often been influenced by Party feelings, as was the case now— Farlee, in the last Congress, had voted against making the allowance, to John. M. Botts, in his contest with John. W. Jones—and now, Robert Schenck, moved to amend the Resolution offered by Dobbin, so as to grant the same allowance, to Botts, for the contest in the last Congress— The Speaker, got rid of this amendment, by deciding, that it was out of order.— John. H. Ewing of Pennsylvania, then moved to amend the resolution, by making the money payable out of the Treasury, but this two was evaded by the Speaker— The Previous Question was moved and carried by yeas and nays, 105. to 46. to pay Farlee— But no allowance was made for Botts—although Schenck, moved to suspend the rules, to offer a resolution, in his favor; but this was refused by yeas and nays, 62. to 110. Tibbatts of Kentucky moved to suspend the rules, to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the River and Harbour appropriation Bill, but the House refused— Isaac. E. Holmes, moved as a privilege question, that when the House adjourn it should be over to Monday— The yeas and nays and Tellers, were successively called for, and refused—and Holmes motion was carried by a large majority— The House then went into consideration of Private Bills not objected to— The Bill for the relief of Col. William Grayson. Henry. S. Clark, of North Carolina, withdrew, his objection against the passage of the Bill, but another member, objected, and it went over The House went into Committee of the whole—Julius— Rockwell—in the Chair, on Private Bills, four of which, were laid aside to be reported, without objection, and forty three, were called and objected to— Samuel Gordon moved that the Committee should rise, in which no quorum voted, the Committee rose, and reported that fact, to the House— Preston King moved to adjourn, which was carried— No visitors this evening— "

Amory, of Roxbury, notifying him, of his conditional appointment, as a Cadet, at the Military Academy at West Point— I had also received, a Letter, from the Commissioner of Pensions, with a Pension Certificate, in favor of Susanna Lancy, for arrears, due to Betty Wheat, at the time of her decease, This certificate had already been sent, by me, to Elijah Clark, who had sent it back, with some inquiry whether the Pension, was not payable, to other persons, children of Betty Wheat, I referred it to the Commissioner who returned it to me again, with assurance, that it could be paid, only to Susanna Lancy.— I enclosed it again to Mr. Clark, and rode to the Capitol, where I deposited in the Post Office, my Letters to Mr. Amory and to Mr. Clark, and one to Mr. Clark, enclosing the certificate, and also one to Mr. Totten, acknowledging, the receipt, of his Letter to Mr. Amory— I walked home from the Capitol— Isaac Hull Adams dined with us, and we had short evening visits, from Mr. Healey and Mr. Dubourjal— "

Psalm— Before Jehovah’s awful Throne and preached from Isaiah 26.3. “Thou wilt keep him, in perfect peace whose mind is staid on thee, because he trusteth in Thee”— The Discourse was upon peace— When I heard him name his text, I had some suspicion, that it would bear a Political complexion— There are rumors of War prevailing about the Country, fomented, for political purposes, and in some parts of the Country, they have produced, a pious combination, of Ministers of the Gospel, to preach for peace, not in the spirit of the Gospel, but for purposes, altogether worldly— But Dr. Codman, had no such intention. his exhortations were to peace with God—peace of mind— He is Minister of a congregational Church at Dorchester, adjoining the Town of Quincy. Of the Calvanistic creed, and partly educated at Edinburgh in Scotland— He is a man of most estimable private character, and of good understanding not however remarkably eloquent, or eminent as a Preacher— I heard him again in the afternoon at the 2d. Presbyterian Church, where the Rev. Matthew. Hale. Smith, is now the Pastor, and was with him in the Pulpit, performing the services jointly with him— His text was, Romans 15.4—“For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope”— The emphatic word of this text was hope, derived from the Scriptures—the exposition of which formed the subject of the Discourse. Miss Cutts was here this evening.— The snow has nearly disappeared, and the Spring is setting in— I have read the Poem in blank verse, upon the Immortality of the Soul, and upon the worth of the Soul— It is accompanied with notes, more voluminous than the verse— Part of which I have read.

P. Espy, called on me again, and presented to me a copy, of his Book on the Philosophy of Storms, a large Octavo volume with a separate Pamphlet in folio being a first report on meteoroligy, adressed to the Surgeon General of the United States Army with numerous Charts, exhibiting the direction of the winds, in the Sorms of the year 1843— Mr. Espy left with me also a Letter soliciting my aid, in support of an application which he has before Congress, for compensation, to him, for his invention of conical ventilators made for Ships, of one of which, he brought with him, a small tin model, and explained to me, its operation. He claims, a sum of $50000. for this invention—and has a Letter, of 9. January 1844 from A. P. Upshur shortly before that time Secretary of the Navy and at that time Secretary of State, expressing the opinion, in unison with that of Capt Beverly Kennon, that the right to use it, in our Navy, would be cheaply purchased at that price. He has also similar certificates, from Mr. John. Y. Mason, some time Secretary of the Navy, and from Captains William Ramsay, and Charles Wilkes, Lieut Henry Eld, and Dr. Thomas Harris, of the Navy. At the House, this was one of the days for the reception of Petitions, but none were presented—and since the rule, for receiving petitions, at the Clerks table, and having them committed to appropriate Committees, the practise of presenting them publicly, is going into disuse— Several resolutions, from the Legislatures of the States, relating entirely to local concerns, were however, presented and refered George C.

Lieutenant George Thom.Corps. of Topographical Engineers of the United States—  In the House, a motion made yesterday, that the House should adjourn this day at three o’clock, to attend the funeral of Gen John P. Van Ness, was after a call for the yeas and nays laid on table, without taking them— John Wentworth of Illinois, moved to close the debate in Committee of the whole, on the River and Harbour Bill, at two o’clock P.M. next Tuesday, which after sundry motions to substitute next Friday, and to lay the resolution on the Table, was finally carried, by yeas and nays 106. to 66— Thomas. J. Henley of Indiana, moved that 35000. copies extra, of the report of the Commissioner of Patents, without the list of Patents, and 7,000. copies of the whole Report, be printed, 2000 copies of which, to be at the disposal, of the Commissioner— Objection being made to this resolution, Henley moved, and carried a suspension of the Rules, and it was received.— John Wentworth, moved to strike out 35000, and insert 100.000, but afterwards substituted 50.000. Andrew Stewart moved to lay the Resolution on the Table; which was lost— Henley said he was apprehensive that some gentlemen, were under the impression, that the Report contained matter relating to the Tariff, which, he was assured it did not, and he sent to the Clerk, a Letter from Edmund Burke the Commissioner, disclaiming all reference to Party politics— The previous Question was moved— Garrett Davis, moved a proviso to limit to three thousand dollars, the profit to the printer, and stated that, the profit on the printing, would be about $20.000. Wentworth’s motion, was rejected by yeas and nays— Garrett Davis, moved again to lay the resolution on the Table, which was again rejected, and it was carried by yeas and nays 127. to 55. The river and Harbour Bill was resumed, in Committee of the Whole, on the state of the Union, Thomas Smith of Indiana in the Chair.— James. J. Faran of Ohio, and Samuel Gordon of New York, made speeches in favor of the Bill— Meredith. P. Gentry, took the floor, but the Committee rose.— The Speaker presented several communications, from the executive Departments— William. L. Yancey of Alabama, moved to go into Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, again, to take up the River and Harbour Bill, but there was no quorum on the vote— Henley moved that when the House should adjourn to meet tomorrow at eleven o’clock which was carried— Three successive motions were then made to adjourn— All rejected by yeas and nays, without a quorum, but the fourth trial succeeded 58. to 54. and the House adjourned till 11. o’clock tomorrow— I went into the Senate Chamber, while the dull debate on the Harbour Bill was sleeping in the House, and heard the close of a Speech, by George Evans of Maine, against our title to Oregon, beyond Latitude 49. North, faintly asserting it South of that Line—ardent in its efforts, to refute the arguments, of the New York Senators, in favor of the title, to 54.40. and closing by saying that he did not know whether to vote for giving the notice to terminate the Convention of 1827. or against it— No visitors this evening— "

V—  Much of my time is consumed, in preparations for distributing, the Congressional Documents, of which an extra number are printed for distribution among the people— I have heretofore always, made out, at the commencement of every Session, a list of the names of the persons to whom I send them consisting, of my Son, of the Editors of the Newspapers printed in my Congressional District, with one or two at Boston the Councillors, and Members of the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, from the Counties, and Towns, composing the District, being twenty two Towns, the whole County of Norfolk, four Towns in Plymouth County, and five in Middlesex— At this Session however, I have long delayed to make out this list— This I have however, now completed, but have an accumulation of Documents, to transmit. I have added to my list, a number of names— The usual number of Documents, furnished to each Member of the House is from twenty five to forty, but at this, and one or two preceding Sessions the number ordered to be printed of certain favorite Documents allow to each Member upwards of 100. I have therefore been obliged to make a double list for the small and the greater number— At the House, W. W. Campbell of New York, one of the four from the City, moved the appointment of a Select Committee, to report if any alterations should be made in the Consular system of the United States, with leave to report by Bill—otherwise— A Committee of five was appointed, consisting of W. W. Campbell, R. F. Simpson of South Carolina, Charles. J. Ingersoll, James. McDowell, the new Member from Virginia, and Robert. C. Winthrop— Mr. McDowell, who was the late Governor of Virginia, came and renewed acquaintance with me at my seat, he having heretofore visited me, about ten years ago. He is from Western Virginia, and a man of splendid talents. William. G. Brown, of Virginia, moved an instruction to the Committee on Pensions, to inquire into the expediency of making more ample provision, for the indigent soldiers, and Pensioners of the Revolution— George Ashman, of Massachusetts, moved an instruction to the Committee on the Judiciary to consider of measures, to enable claimants against the United States, to obtain justice, now denied them— The object is, to institute a Judicial Tribunal corresponding with the Court of Exchequer in England— A measure often attempted, and not likely to succeed— Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, asked leave to introduce a Bill, to authorize every poor man, in the U.S. who is the head of a family to enter one-hundred and sixty Acres, of the Public domain, without money and without price— A race for popularity, to outrun McConnell; but the leave, was not yet granted— Caleb. B. Smith, of Indiana, reported for the Committee of Foreign Affairs, a Bill, making Appropriations, for the payment, of two instalments, of the Mexican Indemnities, provided for by the Convention of January 30th. 1843. between Mexico and the United States— These are the instalments paid from the Mexican Treasury, to the Agent of the United States Voss, and for which, according to Mr. John Baldwins statement to me, the Agent Voss, and Waddy Thompson are jointly or se. . .ly yet to account to the Treasury of the United States— After sundry other affairs, of minor interest, the River and Harbour Bill, was again taken up, in Committee, of the whole on the state of the Union— Thomas Smith of Indiana in the Chair— Albert Constable of Maryland, made an hour speech, in favor of the Bill generally, under an Appropriation for Havre De Grace, in particular— John. F. Collin of the 11th. Congressional District of New York, John. A. Rockwell of Connecticut, Washington Hunt, of New York, Robert. C. Winthrop, made speeches, all in favor of the Bill— Winthrop’s speech, was in his highest style of eloquence. The Committee rose, Jacob Thompson of Mississippi presented a Memorial, from the Legislature of that State, asking a grant of Land for the use of schools.— Refered to the Committee on Public Lands— The House adjourned, till 11. o’clock to-morrow morning— Evening visit from Lieut.

And why is it said, that the Sceptre shall not depart from Judah, until he come? I walked to, and from the Capitol, and after dinner at the 2nd. Presbyterian Church, heard Mr. Matthew Hale-Smith preach from Romans. 9.16. “So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God, that sheweth mercy.” This Chapter contains the principal argument of Saint Paul to establish the doctrines of election and pre-destination— Mr. Smith observed, that in the Epistle of Peter, it is said “That there are in the writings of the Apostle Paul, some things hard to be understood”—and that this remark is especially applicable to this passage, of the Epistle to the Romans.— It seems to import, that the mercy of God, is not obtainable by the will or the exertions of man, but that it is merely the result, of the arbitrary will of the Creator— The Apostle appears aware, that the doctrine is susceptible of great objection. In the preceding context, he says [“]It is written Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated,[”] and then he enquires [“]what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid, for he saith to Moses I will have mercy, on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion, on whom I will have compassion,” and in the subsequent context—he adds “thou wilt say then unto me, why doth he yet find fault, for who hath resisted his will[”] and to this he replies, Nay, but O man who art thou, that repliest against God, shall the thing formed, say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? This may be called cutting the gordion Knot, but is no answer to the objection— The whole Chapter deserves deep meditation— "

VI  I went this morning, to the Office of Col Totten the Chief Engineer, to have rectified, the name, of Thomas Isaac Coffin Amory, to whom, a warrant of Cadet, at the Military Academy at Westpoint, had been sent— I found it already done, and answered the Letters, of this young gentleman and of his Father— From the Engineer Office I proceeded to the Capitol, and found, the House of Representatives in Session.— The reading of the Journal of Saturday, had been dispensed with, and they were in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Thomas Smith in the Chair upon the river and Harbour appropriation Bill. Edward. H. Ewing of Nashville Tennessee, was arguing the Constitutional power, of Congress to establish and maintain a general system of internal improvement— He quoted from the Federalist, and pronounced a magnificent panegyric, upon the purity of character, of Alexander Hamilton, His hour closed, while he was discoursing, upon the necessity of Appropriations for the improvement of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers— He was followed by Asa Biggs, with an argument against the Constitutionality of appropriations for internal improvement, and gave notice, that he should move an appropriation for re-opening Roanoke inlet, at or nearhead in North Carolina one hundred thousand dollars.— Thomas Perry of Maryland, moved an additional section to the Bill, directing the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer, to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company all the stock of the United States in that Company, upon suitable conditions— Mr. Perry too has Constitutional scruples, about the power of Congress, to make internal improvements, and said he should discriminate in his votes, between the items, which in his opinion were, and those which were not within the pale of the Constitution. Richard. P. Herrick of New York, moved an appropriation $5000— for the improvement of the Navigation of the Hudson River, at what is called the over— John H. Ewing of Pennsylvania, made an hour speech, in favour of internal improvement, and in reprobation, of the annexation of Texas.— George Rathbun, of New York, spoke in favor of appropriation on the Harbours of the Lakes, and against the purchase of the Louisville and Portland Canal. John A. McClernand of Illinois, defended, the Democratic Party, against the charges of inconsistency and discordance, made by Ewing of Pennsylvania, and then referring to the Oregon Question noticed the coincidence between the Resolution offered by Robert C. Winthrop to refer the subject to Arbitration and the subsequent proposal from the British minister to the same effect— Mr. Winthrop very solemnly disclaimed any knowledge, of the intention of the British Government to make this proposal, when he offered his resolution Mr. McClernand, was strongly opposed to the appropriation proposed in the Bill of $75.000. for the Harbour of Saint Louis— The substituted member from Florida, Brockenbrough, made an hour speech against the Constitutionality of appropriations for internal improvements, and bitterly complained, that Florida, which has cost the Union more than fifty millions of dollars, had not had her share, of the Public monies— Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi piped out his hour, to the same tune, complaining that all the money of the people, was raised at the South, and expended at the East, the direct reverse of which, is much nearer the truth— It was now past five o’clock— Joseph A. Woodward of South Carolina, took the floor, motion was made for the Committee to rise; no Quorum The Committee rose and reported the fact, motions to adjourn and for a call of the House, were alternately made, and rejected, till past seven o’clock, when a motion for a call was carried— I saw there were hours of idleness, and no business for the night, in prospect, answered at the call of my name, and immediately left the House and came home— The call was continued, till half past nine o’clock, when a number of members, were brought to make their excuses in the House, which then adjourned, to ten oclock tomorrow morning— When I got home, I found my dear wife very ill, in bed— Dr. Thomas was sent for, came, and prescribed, with a promise that she would be better to-morrow— We had evening visits from Mr. Healey, Mr. Doubourjal and Mr. Carter Lee— "

Dowlin, Edmund Stubbs, John Boyd and Thomas Donahue, an invitation to attend as a guest, at a public dinner this day, at Carusi’s Salon, in honor, of Ireland’s patron saint, which I declined in consideration, of my infirm health and recent domestic affliction— At the House, which met at 10. o’clock Tibbatts moved to dispense with the reading of the Journal, but Dromgoole objected, and it was read.— He then said, that there was a statement in the Journal: that all the Members who came into the Hall last evening, ending the call, were brought in, in custody of the Sergeant at Arms, which he believed was not the fact. The Clerk read the Journal, which stated, that the Sergeant at Arms, came into the Hall, with the following named members, giving their names.—Dromgoole said he wished to separate the names to distinguish those who came in, voluntarily and those, who were really brought in by the Sergeant at Arms—to save the House, from the payment of the fees, whereupon Atkinson, and several others, denied, having been brought in, by the Sergeant at Arms, and the Speaker said, the Journal would be corrected and so the petty-pride, of the delinquents, was spared the mortification of appearing upon the record, as prisoners to the Sergeant at Arms— Houston of Alabama, at the discipline of the call of the House, had not been completely carried through last night, several members, whose names went on the Journals, as absentees, in custody and on trial, had yet to be excused—he was for resuming the process, but the Speaker said that an adjournment put an end, to all unfinished proceedings in a call of the House— The river and Harbour Bill, was then resumed, in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Thomas Smith in the Chair, Joseph. A. Woodward of South Carolina, made an hour speech, against the Constitutional power of Congress—to appropriate money for internal improvements, followed by James. B. Bowlin of Saint Louis Missouri, in a volunteer, and quite unneccessary defence of the West against the charge, of plundering the public Treasury, and retorting the charge, not against South Carolina, whence it came, but upon the East more odious to South Carolina, than the West itself— Tibbatts of Kentucky and McClernand, of Illinois, had some altercation, about appropriations for the benefit of the West— Cocke of Tennessee supported the Amendment moved by his Colleague Crozier, about the Muscle Shoals, and Daniel P. King of Massachusetts, moved three additional appropriations within that state— Joshua. F. Bell. of Kentucky offered an Amendment but had not time to make a speech, the hour of two, having arrived which had been previously fixed, for voting upon the proposed Amendments, and taking the Bill out of Committee from that time till about five o’clock a multitude of Amendments, were proposed and adopted or rejected in Committee, as the humor of the majority directed— When the Committee rose and the House adjourned— We had evening visits from General and Mrs. Jesup, and from an old acquaintance whom I had not for a long time seen Carter Lee— "

This sickly sensibility, to the animadversions of the Press, manifested by arbitrary acts, of power, unchecked by Judicial controul, seems to be common, to all deliberative assemblies; and always terminates, to their disadvantage— This morning Mr. Sawyer, of Ohio made a personal explanation, with reference to a report of his speech yesterday, in the National Intelligencer of this day, and was followed by his Colleague Mr. Delano, also, with a personal explanation— John. P. Martin of Kentucky from the Committee on Mileage, reported a resolution to discharge the Committee of the whole, from the further consideration of the mileage Bill, which was adopted— James. B. Bowlin of Missouri, then moved an Amendment to the Bill, to retrench the pay, of every Member of the House, for every day of his absence from it, and even, for every absence failure to answer upon any call of the House, or of the yeas and nays— Thomas Perry, of Maryland, moved to lay the Amendment on the Table; which the House refused— Archibald Yell of Arkansas, moved to amend Bowlin’s Amendment, by reducing the pay, of members, to six dollars, a day, and for every twenty miles travel— Also an additional section, to remove the seat of Government of the United States, from the year 1850. to a place near Saint Louis, in the State of Missouri— Bowlin accepted this, as a part of his Amendment, and George W. Jones of Tennessee, moved to substitute instead of Saint Louis, Jeffersonville in the State of Indiana, on the avowed ground, that if the seat of Government, was to be removed, it should be into a free State; whereupon George. C. Dromgoole of Virginia, moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the river and Harbour Bill—which was done.— The voting upon the amendments was resumed— A multitude of Amendments were proposed. Some of them, in derision, and for very unwarrantable sport Among them, one by George Fries, of Ohio, grossly and personally insulting, to his Colleague Schenck, which occasioned an altercation, and a retort from Schenck, upon which a full hour of the House was wasted, and the time disgracefully lost— The yeas and nays were taken upon numerous Amendments, the first, upon a provision, of five thousand dollars, for removing the obstructions—from the Harbour, at Providence Rhode Island; upon which Lynn Boyd of Kentucky, called for the yeas and nays, and it was carried, 99. to 96. The appropriation of $15.000, for removing the obstructions of Newark Bay New Jersey, was also carried, by yeas and nays 98. to 89— Crozier of Tennessee, had moved, an item of $100.000., for the Muscle Shoals, which was lost by yeas and nays, 65. to 125. and thereupon, Crozier, who had voted for the appropriation of $5000. for Providence Harbour, moved a reconsideration of that vote, which was lost by yeas and nays 95. 102. This is a specimen, of the slave monger system, of internal improvements— 1/2 past 3. o’clock the House adjourned— Evening visit from Mr. Abel Shawk. who requested me, to call and have my portrait taken by Daguerreotype Machine, at Plumb’s Gallery—in the Pennsylvania Avenue, at 11. o’clock to-morrow morning—to which I assented— "

Lynn Boyd, called for yeas and nays on an item of five thousand dollars, for the improvement of S.Bay on Lake Ontario. Carried 103. to 83— Again on an item of $7000. of the improvement of Oak Orchard Harbour, state of New York. Carried 94. to 87— Again $40000. for the improvement of St Clair flats, on Lake Michigan— Carried, 117. to 70— $40.000, for improving of Michigan City; carried 99. to 81— For the improvement of Little Fort Harbour, on Lake Michigan $12.000— For improving the Harbour at Saint Louis Missouri, $75.000— For removing obstructions in Newark Bay New-Jersey $15.000. For improving the Harbour at Havre de Grace Maryland, $20000.— All of which were carried. when Seaborn Jones of Georgia, under a surfeit of yeas and nays, and of internal improvements, rose and said, that Mr. Colquit one of the Senators from Georgia had lost a child, the funeral of which to take place, this afternoon, the Delegation from Georgia, wished to attend, and he therefore moved the House to adjourn, which was carried, without opposition— This evening, with Mrs. John Adams, Walter Hellen, and Mary Louisa, I attended a Concert, at Carusi’s Saloon, given by Leopold De Meyer, the performer of wonders, upon the grand Piano—assisted by an indifferent Singer named Wood— The House was crowded, and the performance, said to be, quite extraordinary— De Meyer, has the reputation, of being one of the finest performers, of the age. He was at his own request, introduced to me, after the performance was over, and I thanked him very sincerely, for the entertainment of the evening— "

J. Allen, of the first Regiment of Dragoons of his expedition last Summer to the heads of the Des Moins Blue Earth, and other rivers, in the north west, called for, by a resolution of the House; referred to the Committee on Military Affairs— The first Question taken by yeas and nays, on the River and Harbour Bill, was upon an item of $25.000 for improving Hog Island Channel at Charleston City—South Carolina— The call for the yeas and nays was by W. W. Woodworth, of the 8. Congressional District of New York merely for retaliation upon the members from South Carolina, for voting against, all the other appropriations; The vote was 82 to 86, and the appropriation, was lost by the votes of the South Carolina Members themselves, James. A. Black, Richard. F Simpson, Joseph. A Woodward, Alexander D. Simms, Armistead Burte and Robert. Barnwell. Rhett, all voting against it Six out of seven— Isaac. E. Holmes, of Charleston, did not vote— If the South Carolina Members had voted for the appropriation, it would have been carried 88. to 80, without Holmes vote— The chalice, was thus effectually returned, to their own lips— The next item $50.000. for the improvement of Savannah Harbour, and the naval anchorage, near Fortwas carried 166. to 77—and then an item of $4.450 for the improvement of Great Wood hole Harbour Massachusetts by a vote of 100. to 89— The purchase, of the stock of the Louisville and Portland Canal, was rejected 56 to 131— The item, for continuing the improvement of the Hudson River, above and below Albany $75.000, was carried, 102. to 79— and for the improvement of the Ohio river, above the Falls at Louisville $80.000. by 112 to 72—and below the Falls of Louisville and of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Arkansas rivers $240.000. by 118. to 67.— Hilliard of Alabama moved to reconsider the vote rejecting the item of $25.000, for the Channel at Charleston, but it was refused, 73. to 100— The Question upon the engrossment of the Bill was then taken, carried and the Bill was passed, after a motion by George. S. Houston of Alabama, to lay it on the Table; rejected; 86. to 109, and the passage of the Bill was carried 110. to 91.— The title of the Bill, was, “An Act making Appropriations for the improvement of certain Harbours and Rivers”— W. W. Paine of Alabama, moved to Amend the title, to read “An Act making appropriations, for works of internal improvement, within the States[”]— Rhett called for the yeas and nays on this notable amendment, which was rejected 81. to 117. The title was then suffered to pass without call for yeas and nays— Tibbatts moved a re-consideration of the vote, by which the Bill was passed, which the House refused, and the House adjourned, over to next Monday.

J. Ingersoll, and earnestly recommended, that Mr. Kavasales, who is now upon furlow should be ordered to accompany Capt Reed, which the Clerk assured me, he would report to the Secretary.

At the House, on Friday last, my Colleague Mr. George Ashman, whose seat is immediately before mine, told me that this was his daughters birth-day— He had written her a Letter of congratulation, and was very desirous, of enclosing with it, an autograph of mine—whereupon I immediately wrote, and gave him, the lines of which the following are a copy—  To Miss Lucy Hooker Ashman—  daughter of Hon George Ashman, of SpringfieldMassachusetts, on her birth day 20. March 1846.aged 14—  I wrote also two others, copies of verses, which I will not here repeat, one, for Miss Camp of Owego, and the other for Miss Cornelia B. Joy of Ovid, both in the state of New York, for autographs— Ovid, seems to be a place, well suited for poetic inspiration— This day I attended Public worship, at the Hall of the House of Representatives, where Mr. Tustan, the Chaplain of the Senate, officiated, and the preacher was a stranger and from his accent I infer an Irishman, His text, was from 1. Corinthians, 10.3. “And did all eat, the same spiritual meat. 4. And did all drink, the same spiritual drink, (for they drank, of that spiritual rock, that followed them, and that rock was Christ)”— Isaac Hull Adams dined with us, and Walter Hellen dined out at his mother’s— After dinner, at the 2nd. Presbyterian Church, Mr. Matthew. Hale Smith preached, from Ecclesiastes. 7–10. “Say not thou, what is the cause, that the former days, were better than these, for thou dost not enquire, wisely, concerning this”— Mr. Smith said, that this text, was applicable, to the present time, for the best of all reasons, that the former days were not better than these— "

Happiness— A Sonnet—  I awaked between two and four in the morning, and unable to sleep again, racked my brain for verses, till the dawn of day permits me, to rise— This is one of the physical developements, which returns upon me, frequently, in the Spring of the year; continues some times for weeks together until a close approach to distraction breaks it off— The above search for happiness, is one of its symptoms; which wasted the hours of this morning— At the House, this was the day for the presentment of Petitions, and the Speaker called, on the state of Rhode Island and then on Massachusetts I had a Memorial, from the Massachusetts Historical Society, which I desired to present. And before I could do so, Hugh Haralson of Georgia—Chairman of the Military Committee, moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and to take up the Bill to raise two Regiments of Riflemen reported by him, very early in the Session— I stated to the Speaker, my wish to present the Memorial, from the Massachusetts Historical Society, and reminded him that he had called the state of Massachusetts for petitions, but he would not hear me, and said he had called the State of Massachusetts, by mistake— The House went into Committee, and took up the Bill, to raise two Regiments of Riflemen, and for other purposes John. I. McKay of North Carolina, in the Chair— Thomas Smith of Indiana, moved to Amend the Bill, from reducing it from two Regiments to one. The Bill was debated, by William Sawyer of Ohio—Jacob Brinkerhoff of the same State, Felix. G. McConnell of Alabama, Lynn Boyd of Kentucky, Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine, James. A.

Holmes of South Carolina, took the floor moved an Amendment, and then, the Committee to rise— A Message was received, from the President, which was received with ears all erect, expecting, some new Oregon Negotiation, and an instant demand that it should be read, terminating in a general laugh, when found only to be a correspondence, concerning the payment of certain Duties Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means— Haralson, offered a resolution to close all debate, on the Bill to raise two Regiments of Riflemen— But a motion was immediately made, amid shouts of no, no, no, from all parts of the House, to adjourn, which was carried without opposition.

                "text": "24— IV— V.30—  I have received from Albert Gallatin, the first volume of the transactions, of the American Ethnological Society—Of which he is President, located at New York, and the objects of which, are declared to comprise inquiries, into the origin, progress, and characteristics, of the various races of Man.— I have also received, from Mr. John Jay, Domestic Corresponding Secretary of the New York Historical Society, a volume, containing, the pro-ceedings of that Society, for the year 1845—and have only to lament, that I have neither time or capacity, to give a proper attention to their contents. Before repairing to the House, this morning, I went to the Pension Office, with a Letter from Alonzo Taft, which I left with Mr. Edwards, containing inquires concerning certain Papers, which Mr. Taft says, he put into my hands, in September 1842— Mr. Edwards promised to inquire and report to me, whether those papers were at the Pension Office, or not— My own recollection of them, is quite indistinct— I then proceeded to the Capitol, where at the House, the reading of the Journal was dispensed with. The resolution offered by Hugh. A Haralson, last evening, at the adjournment, to close the debate, for raising two additional Regiments of Riflemen, and for other purposes, at three o’clock this day; and after an ineffectual motion of R. W. Roberts, to lay it on the table, was adopted without a division— Haralson immediately moved to go into Committee which was carried. Felix. G. McConnell moved to lay the Bill aside, and take up another, but the Chairman McKay, declared this not in order— A debate ensued, and continued, until 3. o’clock, when the voting commenced, upon the Amendments proposed to the Bill; one of which was rejected and another adopted— While the process was going on of taking these votes by Tellers, Robert. C. Winthrop came to my seat, and told me, he should vote for this Bill.— I said I regretted again to part from him, for that I had come to the determination to vote against it— The Senate not having acted upon the Bill for giving Notice to the British Government of the termination of the Convention of 1827, and the balance, of probability now being, that the Senate would not pass it at all. He said that a message had been received in the Senate, from the President in answer to a Resolution of that body, offered some days since, by Mr. Dayton, in which the President, declares explicitely, that in his judgment the present position of the Country does require, an addition to its armed force— Hereupon I rose and moved that the Committee should rise, to enable me, to move in the House, a reconsideration of the vote, by which it had been determined, to take the Bill out of Committee, at 3. o’clock this day— An immediate, and violent opposition, was made to my motion, with loud calls to order— I asked leave to state my reason, for the motion I had made; but the objections and calls to order, continued and increased, during which, I made out, to give my reason, which was, that a message had been received in the Senate from the President, which in all probability would decide my vote and perhaps that of the House, upon the Bill— The struggle, against granting me the leave, to assign my reasons was so vociferous, and peremptory that the Chairman McKay, without taking the Question upon it, said, that he had been mistaken, in supposing that the Committee had assented to give me the leave, and ordered me to take my seat—which I did— Tellers were then called upon my motion for the Committee to rise, and 82 Members, were reported by the Tellers, in the affirmative— This was a majority of the voters present, and the Committee rose— The Chairman, said, that the Resolution in the House, did not require that the Question upon the Bill should be taken this day, that it might be still debated in the House. I replied, that it came to the same thing that if the Bill should be reported, the previous Question would be called and the Question upon the Bill immediately taken. The Committee having risen, I made my motion for reconsideration of the vote, for taking the Bill out of Committee this day— Thomasson of Kentucky and Albert Smith of New York, immediately moved to adjourn— George W. Jones of Tenn. enquired of the Speaker if I had voted for the Resolution, which I now moved to reconsider? The Speaker said that this Question would be in order, when the motion to reconsider, should come up I had voted against the Resolution, and according to the Rules of the House, was not competent, to make the motion to reconsider, but my object was attained by the rising of the Committee and the adjournment of the House, which immediately followed— We shall know the purport of the President’s message to the Senate, before taking the final vote on the Bill In the evening a Mr. Leffenwell and another person from New Jersey, made us visits, merely of curiosity "

                "text": "25— V.30.  Morning visit from Mr. Robert Owen, who told me, that he should leave the City to-morrow, about to embark for England, where he proposed, to use his best exertions for procuring the amicable adjustment, of the differences, existing between the Government of that Country, and the United States, and he enquired if I had read an article signed by him, in the National Intelligencer of this morning— I had seen his signature but passed over the article taking it for the repetition of one published some days since— He told me the substance of it, which was, that a final settlement should be made, with the least loss of time, on the base of the 49. degree of Latitude to the Pacific with Van Couver’s Island to the British, and the free navigation of the Columbia River for ten years— He hoped that I would concur with him in this opinion— I told him, that I wished him all possible success in his exertions to preserve the peace between the two Countries, which I believed, to be in no sort of danger, but that as to the terms of settlement, the whole range of my ideas both as to right and expediency, were directly the reverse of his— That I believed our right, to Latitude 54–40 on the South Sea, was perfect, with the single exception of actual possession; that Great Britain had no right there, of permanent possession, at all; that with regard, to War and Peace, considered in the abstract, I agreed with him, and with all benevolent and humane, throughout the World, I held it in utter abhorence—as much so, as the Roman mother’s in the days of Horace and of Augustus Caesar.— But that there are and always have been, as long as the race of men has existed, times and occasions, of dire necessity for War—and philosophically speaking, I believed that War, was not a corrupter, but rather a purifier, of the moral character of Man.— That peace was the period of corruption to the human race, and I asked him, if he recollected the passage, of the Paradise Lost, in which the Ark Angel Michael, after the fall of Adam, foretells to him, the fortunes of his posterity, in War and Peace, after describing to him all the horrors of War, draws before him a picture of his condition in Peace, and such it is, that Adam in contemplating it says—  Mr. Owen, did not recollect the passage in Milton; probably never having read it. but he expatiated upon his anticipations of the universal revolution, started by him, and now in progress, and which will soon, transform and exalt the nature of Man, to be gouverned, by the laws of God, and not by circumstances, and the Laws of Man— He thought that his purposes and mine were the same, the ultimate improvement, and exaltation of the nature of Man and his condition, upon earth, but the means by which we believe this revolution is to be effected are widely different. Mr. Owens visit, delayed my departure for the Capitol, so that when I reached the House, I found them in session, having laid on the Table, my motion to reconsider, the vote for taking the Bill out of Committee yesterday, no longer necessary and they were already in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, taking the Questions on the several Amendments to the Bill for raising two additional Regiments of Riflemen— A substitute for the Bill itself, had already been adopted, by authorizing the President, at his discretion, to increase the number of Privates in each Company, of the existing Regiments, of Dragoons, Artillery, and Infantry to any number not exceeding 80. The enlistment to be, for three years, unless sooner disbanded, by the President— The Bill was thus reported to the House.— Joseph McDowell of Ohio, moved to lay it on the Table, which was rejected by yeas and nays 32 to 149.—and then the Bill was passed, by yeas and nays 164 to 15. Bowlin of Ohio moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up the Bill to raise a Regiment of mounted Riflemen and for establishing Military Posts on the route to Oregon.— The House accordingly went into Committee Preston King in the Chair—but instead of Bowlin’s Bill took up at motion of McKay, the Bill to supply deficiencies, and appropriations, for certain objects made for the service of the fiscal year ending June 30. 1846. Upon which a debate arose, and sharp altercation between W. W. Paine of Alabama, and R. C. Winthrop about the Hartford Convention, blue-lights and the party warfare of 1812. till at 4. o’clock the Committee rose, McKay moved a resolution to close debate on this Bill, at 3. p.m. tomorrow, and the House adjourned— No evening visitors, but we read, Benetts New-York Herald, and Shakespeare at Paris from Littells Living Age— "

                "text": "26. V.30—  Long morning visit, from E. Rees. Price Esqr. of Cincinnati, and conversation with him, concerning his imaginary revellations and inspirations— He believes that a universal revolution, in the Gouvernments of this World, is at this moment in progress.— though as yet, imperceptible, to all but himself— That it commenced, on the equinoxial day, of this month; that all the present Governments, of the earth, are to be overthrown, that of the United States, first, that of Great Britain next, and the rest, in regular succession— In their place, is to arise, a new order of Governments at the head of which, he supposes himself, destined, by revellation to preside, and in which there will be no Department of War, as War is to cease upon earth— He explained to me, in considerable detail, the particulars, of this revolution, and said, he had been subject, of occasional revellations, from the year 1827. having never before, that time, had any religious impressions, of any kind— He illustrated, his imaginary revellations, by numerous references, to Scripture Prophecies, from those of Jacob, in the Book of Genesis, to those of John the Evangelist in the Isle of Patmos; like whom he said, he had been in the Spirit from the Lords Day— He quoted passages from the Books of Isaiah, of Daniel, of Zechariah, of Malacchi, and of the Apoch-lips always naming the Chapter and verse and repeating the prophecies, in the words of the scriptures— His discourse was consistent, in all its details rational and apparently sincere— He said he was alone in the world, that he had no credit in his own Country, not even in his own family, that his wife and children with whom he lived in perfect harmony did not believe him; that of his neighbours, some thought him an imposter, and some a monomaniac, not dishonest in his intentions, reasonable, upon all subjects but one, and on that perfectly insane— All this he knew, but he nevertheless, did believe himself not at all times, but on particular occasions, gifted with inspiration from above. That although no one believed him now, he had no doubt, the time would come, and that not distant, when the truth of what he said, would be universally know and understood— I told him, that I did not believe him an Imposter and would not call him a monomaniac, but, I believed him labouring under a mental delusion, but, that he had sufficient capacity of reason left, not to take offense, at my candid avowal, of this opinion. He said that far from taking offense, he thanked me for it, and for the kindness with which I had listened to him—and then took his leave— I then went to the House, where I found the Clerk, reading the Journal of yesterday— The Speaker laid before the House a report from the Secretary of War, with a survey of Green Bay, a statistical report from the Treasury Department, and the Naval Register for the year 1846— The resolution offered by McKay for closing debate on the Bill of deficient appropriations at 3. oclock this afternoon, was carried, after an ineffectual attempt to lay it on the table, and another, to postpone its action, till tomorrow— The House immediately took it up, in Committee of the whole on the State of the Union Preston King, in the Chair— Then came a long and desultory debate, upon various items in the Bill— Abraham R. McIlvaine of Pennsylvania, objected, to an item of transporting troops into Texas, answered by Douglass of Illinois, much annoyed, at the introduction of Anti Slavery into this, or as he said, all other debates, in this House, Brockenbrough, moved an additional item for the benefit of Florida. Garrett Davis, complained, of the precipitation with which this Bill, was to be hurried through the House, and, that there had been confidential communications, from the Secretary of War, to the Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, which he, declined communicating to the House— Which was expressly admitted by Haralson— Davis pungently replied by pointing out the base subserviency to the Executive, of the Chairman of the Military Committee, in holding secret communications, with the Secretary of War, and refusing to disclose them to the House. And he then turned to Isaac E. Holmes Chairman of the Naval Committee and enquired, if he too had received any communications from the Secretary of the Navy— Which Holmes very explicitely denied, and declared, that considering himself as the organ of the House, and not of the Executive, he never would receive as Chairman of the Committee of the House, any confidential communication from the head of our Executive Department— Holmes added, that the Committee had called upon the Secretary of the Navy for a statement, of what further sums, for defence, would be required in that Department, and had received a very short reply, asking for ten additional Steam ships— That the Committee considered this quite unsatisfactory, and a call for more specific details, had been referred to estimates, laid before the Senate; that the Committee had received copies of these, which they would lay before the House, as the organ not of the Executive but of the House— George Dromgoole, who was mellow, sported some buffoonery with Davis, and Chipman of Michigan, chattered a few minutes, till 3. o’clock, when the debate was to cease. The Committee then rose— Rathbun moved to reconsider the debate to close the debate at 3. P.M. this day, which the House refused 86. to 96. A Bill from the Senate, about Contracts on water rotted hemp was passed, per saltum McKay moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union again, but without taking the Question, the House adjourned— Evening visits, from Charles Bradbury of Boston, from three English Quakers, by the name of Stacy— Foster, and a third, not recollected, and from a German by the name of Glück employed in the Survey of the Coast— Mr. Bradbury, is an old acquaintance from the time of my residence at Newburyport—as a student at Law, but has been for many years a resident of Boston— He is now here, on an occasional visit of business— The three English Friends, are travellers, upon a tour of observation in the West India Islands and in this Country, upon Anti-Slavery principles— Mr. Glück, is a native of Germany, employed, in the Survey of our Coast— "

J. Ingersoll, declaring the Commodore’s willingness to take Mr. Kavasales with him as Chaplain— That the Chief Clerk had assured me, that he would make report of my solicitations, to the Secretary, and that I had since received an answer, from Mr. Bancroft that there had already been made, application, for an order to this Station, but that the subject would be duly considered— This was all I was authorized to say, Mr. Kavasales thanked me for my interpolation in his favour, which I do not flatter myself will be successful— I received the evening before last, a Letter from Mrs. F. W. D’Arusmont—heretofore this much known, by the name of Fanny Wright—with it was enclosed, a manuscript Lecture, numbered 15— One of a course, which she proposes to give, at this place, and asks my advice, whether to carry this purpose into execution or not— Madam D’Arusmont, had appeared in the world, with pretensions, as a political and Anti-Religious reformer— And her reputation, had suffered much from her course of life— She said in her Letter, that she proposed to leave this City, this morng. to return, for an indefinite period of time to Europe— I called at her lodgings, at Mrs. Beeler’s between 4 1/2 and 6. Streets, and returned, her manuscript Lecture, declining to advise her, whether to deliver it or not—I believe I had not seen her, for more than 20 years.—and felt the melancholy impression, upon observing, the ravages, of time, and of evident, adversity, upon her personal appearance— At the House, the reading of the Journal was again dispensed with.— Jacob. S. Yost of Pennsylvania, reported from the Committee on Engraving, a resolution for printing the Maps, transmitted to the House, with the Report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office— Jacob Brinkerhoff of Ohio, made a personal explanation, and the House went into Committee of the whole, and took up the private Callender, upon which sundry Bills, were reported to the House, some with recommendation of their passage, and some to be rejected— The last of these, was the Bill for the relief of the Heirs of Col. William Grayson, against which— Henry. S. Clark, of North Carolina, renewed the objection, which he had withdrawn, when the Bill was last before the Committee— It was rejected, on the Question of engrossment, by yeas and nays, 61. to 65. and the House adjourned—to 12. o’clock on Monday. A resolution had been offered, for meeting hereafter, daily at 11. o’clock A.M. but it was laid on the Table— No evening visitors— "

                "text": "29— V.  Yesterday morning I commenced reading the 1. Book of Samuel, the last of the ruling Judges of Israel, and this morning, read the account, of the extraordinary capture of the Ark and Covenant, by the Phillistines. At this reading of the Bible, I have been curious, to mark, the Historical incidents, connected with this Ark of the Covenant, containing, the volume of the Law—written by the finger of God, and delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai. In the 25th. Chapter of Exodus, is contained the command of God, to make this Ark, and the 16th. verse, of that Chapter, is in the following words, “And thou shalt put into the Ark, the testimony, which I shall give thee” In the subsequent parts of that Book, are contained the instructions for keeping this Ark, in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, which was carried, with the Israelites, in their Journeys through the wilderness— In the 31st. Chapter, of Exodus, and the 18th. verse, it is recorded, “That God gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him, upon Mount Sinai, two Tables of Testimony; Tables of Stone, written with the finger of God”— But while Moses was with God in the Mount, the children of Israel rebelled, and made a molten Calf of gold which they worshipped, as the Gods, which brought them out of the Land of Egypt, upon discovering which, when Moses came down from the Mount, in his indignation, he casts the Tables out of his hands, and brake them, beneath the Mount— In the 34th. Chapter of Exodus, the Lord, commanded Moses, to hew him two Tables of Stone like unto the first, on which he wrote the words, that were in the first Tables— In the 40th. Chapter of Exodus, it is recorded, that in the first month in the 2. year, on the first day of the month, the Tabernacle was reared up, in the Wilderness and Moses, took and put the Testimony into the Ark— In the 18th. Chapter of Joshua, after the conquest of Canaan was completed, it is said, “That the whole Congregation of the Children of Israel assembled together at Shiloah and set up, the Tabernacle of the Congregation there[”]— In the subsequent war, with the Phillistines, as appears by the 4th. Chapter of this first Book of Samuel and the 4th. verse, That the people sent to Shiloah, and brought thence the Ark of the Covenant, between the cherubims and the two Sons of Eli, Hopni and Phinehas and in the battle of the Phillistines it was taken— Carried into the House of Dagon; at Ashdod, successively transferred to Gath.— and thence to Ekron was 7. months in the Country of the Phillistines, then brought to Beth Shemesh and thence to Kirjath Jearim and there remained twenty years, till the days of David. Its subsequent History, I shall if it please God, notice hereafter— In the Hall of the House of Representatives, I heard the Chaplain of the House Mr. Milburn preach, from 1. Kings 2.2. part of the verse. “Show thyself a man”—it is the beginning of the injunction of David, on his death bed, to his son Solomon, and was commented upon, by the Preacher, with some eloquence, but not to me with much edification— The Hall was well filled, and a Choir from one of the Methodist Churches, sung two Hymns— Isaac Hull Adams dined here, and after dinner at the 2nd. Presbyterian Church, I heard Mr. Matthew Hale Smith preach from James. 1.27—[“]Pure religion, and undefiled, before God, and the Father is this, “To visit the fatherless, and widows, in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world”— James, is the Apostle of good works and not so high authority to the Calvinistic creed, as Paul. Mr. Smith is a Calvinist but believes also, in the inspiration, of James— "

I found yesterday, the papers, which had been put in my hands, in Oct 1842, by Alonzo Taft, and took them to the Navy Department, where I saw the Secretary Mr. Bancroft, and left them with him. He placed them in the hands of the Chief Clerk of the Department, and promised immediate attention to them— They had been committed to me, during the recess of Congress— I had brought them with me, at the commencement of the Session then ensuing, and had been mislaid upon a file of papers, from that time to this— An instance of forgetfulness on my part, which has seldom happened, as I have made it a practise, specially to note Papers entrusted to me during the recess of Congress, to be used during the subsequent Session— I lament this delinquency of my memory, and gratefully reflect, that it has not oftener occured— On the 24th. of this month, I received a Letter dated on the 20th. at Boston, from Alonzo Taft reminding me of the papers which he had entrusted to me in 1842, and enquiring what had become of them— I took his Letter to the Pension Office, the Commissioner of which J. L. Edwards reported to me, that they were not to be found either in that Office or at the Navy Department. I found them now accidentally in searching for other papers—and the discovery of them administered to me. A mingled feeling of mortification and of pleasure— At the House; this was the day, for the call of the states for resolutions and the House went immediately, into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, and took up the Bill, making appropriations to supply deficiencies in the appropriation Bills of the last year. The Questions were taken, upon various Amendments, after which the Bill was reported to the House, followed by further desultory debate, and was finally passed by yeas and nays 108. to 38. Abner Lewis of New York moved to re-consider the vote of last Saturday, by which the Bill for the relief of the heirs of Colonel William Grayson was rejected on the question of engrossment— The motion was laid over for consideration— The House, at the motion of George. C. Dromgoole, went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Joseph Johnson, in the Chair, and took up the Sub-Treasury Bill so-called.— The Bill was read through, after several motions, to supercede, the rule requiring that it should be so read, and then taken up by sections— A debate upon it was commenced, by Caleb. B. Smith, of Indiana, continued, by William W. Wick, of the same State. Shelton F. Leake of Virginia and John. S. Chipman of Michigan—who had spoken only about five minutes, when a quarter to five the Committee rose, and the House adjourned. No evening visitors— "

An almost sleepless night and much of the morning wasted, in writing verses— Mr. Otis Drury of Boston, came, to claim my assistance in a claim, which he has upon the Government— Some weeks since, there were shipped, by a Quarter Master here, in the Schooner Joy, belonging to Mr. Drury, thirteen pieces of Canon, to be transported to Pensacola, for this Government— On the 2d. of this month, the vessal was stranded on Cran Island near Norfolk, Virginia, and there remains, with the Canons, still on board— Mr. Drury, has been to Norfolk, and comes here, to claim an average, upon the loss, for the proportion, of the value of the guns, and for the charges of recovering them, and transporting them, to Pensacola, according to the original Contract— I went with Mr. Drury, and introduced him to the Secretary of War, Marcy, and to the Quarter Master General, Jesup; to them he stated his claim, and I left him, to agree with them, upon the measures to be pursued, for the fulfilment, of this contract with the Government, after which, I took him to his lodgings, at Coleman’s Hotel; and proceeded to the Capitol, where I found the House in session— Alex. D. Simms, of South Carolina, had moved a resolution, that the daily hour of adjournment, of the House, should hereafter be, to 11. o’clock, A.M. until other was ordered. Winthrop objected— Simms moved, a suspension of the rules— Carried by yeas and nays 105. to 52. and the resolution was adopted— The Speaker, laid before the House, a Letter from the Secretary of the Treasury stating, the withdrawal, of the deposit of Public monies, from sundry Banks and individuals, and the Amount, of the present deposits in many others 34. in number— Dromgoole, moved a resolution, to close the debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the union on the sub-Treasury Bill next Thursday, at 1. o’clock— Sundry amendments were proposed and rejected, and the resolution was adopted The House immediately went into Committee of the whole, on the State of the Union, Joseph Johnson in the Chair and took up the Bill— Chipman of Michigan concluded the Speech which he yesterday commenced, in support of it— Joseph. R. Ingersoll followed for an hour against it and Isaac E. Holmes of South Carolina replied to him— Charles. J. Ingersoll, who had offered an Amendment to the Bill with two or three preliminary whereas’s made a random Speech of an hour, in support of them—and Milton Brown, in less than an hour demolished them all; demonstrating the glaring blunders of which they were composed— John.

H McHenry, asked leave to give notice, of a long complicated and quite useless, addition to the rules, for, proceedings in Committee of the whole to which objection being made, he moved to suspend the rules, to enable him to give the notice; which the House refused, At Dromgoole’s motion, the House went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, J.

H Benton, and Lewis Cass, in the Senate, was this day, continued, and concluded, leaving the Parties, precisely where they were when commenced, between 49. and 54–40. Mr. W. G. Robinson the expelled reporter, for the New York Tribune, was here this evening, with Mr. Dempster the Musician, who entertained us, with several melancholy, and one lively Song. "

V—  I attended Public Service, this morning, where Mr. Tustin the Chaplain of the Senate, made the prayer and Dr. Junkin, President of Lafayette College at Easton Pennsylvania preached, from John 3.1. “There was a man of the Pharisnamed Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews. 2. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher, come from God, for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him— 3. Jesus answered and said unto him verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God 4. Nicodemus saith unto him, how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time, into his mothers womb, and be born. 5. Jesus answered verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter, into the Kingdom of God. 6. That which is born of the Flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit. 7. marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again. 8. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of the Spirit 9. Nicodemus answered an said unto him, how can these things be— 10. Jesus answered and said unto him, art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things.” This text comprises the whole Roman Catholic and Calvanistic—doctrine of re-generation— A creed, upon which the most rigorous reformer from Popery, did not separate from the Church of Rome. It is the most mysterious of all the Doctrines of Christianity, though, if illustrated, by the exclamation of being born of water that is, by baptism & of the Spirit, and by the figurative exposition of the blowing of the wind, I understand as meaning by the Kingdom of God, nothing more than Faith in the Divine Mission of Jesus Christ, and obedience to his commands— Dr. Junkin’s exposition was more comprehensive and included much of the metaphysics of Calvin— After dinner I attended at the 2. Presbyterian Church, where Mr. Matthew Hale Smith, the present Minister commenced his course of Sermons, addressed to young persons, by taking for his text Psalm 119.9. “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto, according to thy word”— Mr. Smith gave notice that there would be a third Service, at 7 o’clock this evening, at that Church, and that his Sermon of next Sunday afternoon, would be addressed to young women. The pews of the Church, were filled, more than I think I have ever seen them before. Mr. William. A. Mosely of Buffalo Member of the House from the 32d. Congressional District of New York a man of intelligence, courteous deportment and pleasant conversation, was here this evening— We had also evening visits from Richard. D. Cutts and his Sister— "

Also Mrs. Stebbins and Mr. Joseph Harrod on their way from New Orleans to Massachusetts.— Mr. Webster, finished in three hours this day his Speech of self vindication, and glorification of his Ashburton Treaty, against the assaults of Charles. J. Ingersoll—in the House and of Daniel. S. Dickinson Senator from the State of New York— More than half of the Members of the House of Representatives, having deserted their Seats to hear him— Most of the day in the House, was consumed in taking the Questions by yeas and nays upon the Cumberland Road Bill, and the Amendments proposed to it. It began by a Call of the House, in the process of which 168. Members answered to their names, and further proceedings were then dispensed with. The first Question was upon the Substitute reported from the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, for the original Bill, this substitute consisted, of a grant of Lands, instead of an appropriation of money for the continuance of the Road; with an Amendment offered by Garrett Davis, of a grant of 500.000 Acres of Land to several states of the Union in consideration of similar grants, already made to others of the States.— There was a very captious debate, whether the substitute and the Amendment, jointly forming the report from the Committee, should be divided so as to take separate Questions on its two parts— The Speaker decided that they could not— The House rejected the Report from the Committee, by yeas and nays 77. to 103. and then the original Bill itself there 70. to 106— Rathbun moved a re-consideration and the Previous Question. Schenck moved to lay the Motion to reconsider on the Table, which was refused and then the motion to re-consider was rejected— The Bill is therefore dead. The House went into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union. McClernand of Illinois, in the Chair, and after some struggling, and two Appeals from the Chairman, the Bill was taken up, to raise a Regiment of Mounted Riflemen, and to erect Military Posts, on the route to Oregon After some debate upon small trifles of Amendment Lewis. C. Levin, of Pennsylvania, moved an Amendment provided “that the Officers and Soldiers, of said Regiment shall be Americans by birth” and he made a native American hour Speech— He was answered, by George C. Dromgoole, of Virginia in a mellow Speech, also of an hour, Sarcastic and ludicrous—after which, the Committee rose, and the House adjourned. "

V—  I have been, several days, occupying my Leisure, in answering a Letter from Joseph Sturge of Birmingham, in England, complaining, of my Speech, on the Oregon Question, and charging me, with inflaming the temper of my Countrymen, to War.— Sturge is a Quaker, and a leading Member of the English Abolition Society— His motives are good, and his character, highly respectable— I have therefore, disclaiming all intention to kindle War, upon this Question, and professing a full concurrence with him, in abhorrence, of all agressive War I have marked the distinction, which should be made between that sentiment, and the unqualified denunciation of War, peculiar to the Doctrines of the Society of Friends, to which I cannot subscribe The Question of War and Peace, is identical, with the Question of Right and wrong— War for the Right, can never be justly blamed. War for the Wrong can never be justified.— In the House, immediately after the reading of the Journal, Jacob Brinkerhoff, moved to go into Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, but withdrew the motion at my request, to introduce, a Resolution calling on the President, to cause to be communicated to the House if not incompatible with Public interest Copies of the Correspondence, of George William Gordon, late Consul of the United States at Rio de Janeiro with the Department of State, relating to the Slave Trade, in Vessels, and by Citizens of the United States, between the Coast of Africa and Brazil— Which resolution was adopted without opposition. The House then went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Reuben Chapman of Alabama in the Chair, and took up the Bill from the Senate, to raise a Regiment of Mounted Riflemen and for the erection of Military Posts for the safety and protection of Immigrants, on the route to Oregon— Sundry Amendments were proposed, and the debated resumed, upon the proviso moved by Mr. Levin, that the Officers and Men of this Regiment should be native Americans The Native American principle was strenuously sustained by W. W. Campbell, and Thomas. M. Woodruff members from the City of New York elected during the popular triumph in that City, on the Native American Party— But that Party finds no favor in this House.— They were encountered, by F. P. Stanton of Tennessee, Chipman of Michigan McConnell of Alabama, and sundry others. Hugh White of New York, moved that the Officers should be selected from the present Officers of the regular Army, and George W. Hopkins moved the establishment of a Post route— Both which propositions gave rise to desultory debate, till the Committee rose, McClernand, of Illinois, moved a resolution, granting the use of the Hall tomorrow evening for the Tutors and Pupils of the New York Institution for the Deaf and Dumb.— On taking the vote there was no quorum, and the House adjourned— Evening visits from Mr. Hogan and Mr. Goldsborough "

William. Hilliard. of the 2d. Congressional District Alabama making a personal explanation of his Speech yesterday in defence and glorification, of Daniel Webster, and which had been sharply taken up, by his Colleague, William. L. Yancey. of the 3d. Congressional District of the same State, whose malignant invective, far transcended the panegyric of Mr. Hilliard. His explanation, only gave occasion to Yancey to renew, with more envenomed bitterness, his charges against Webster—who is at this time pursued, with a rancour, perhaps never surpassed, by any persecution, ever, practised in this Country against any Public Man. It is one of the features of the present times, which I most deeply deplore—  After some discussion, upon the Appeal, by Mr. Ashmun, from the decision of Hopkins acting as Speaker, ruling out of Order Ashmun’s proposed Amendment to the Resolution offered by Thomas H.

J. Ingersoll— Objections were made, that a re-consideration, could not be had, upon, a Document, which had passed out of the possession of the House— Ingersoll’s resolutions having been transmitted to the President— The Speaker decided that a Copy only of the resolution having been transmitted to the President the resolution itself was still in the possession of the House and might be re-considered— McClelland of Illinois appealed from this decision, which after debate was sustained by the House. Dixon then supported his motion by an hour speech, Daniel of North Carolina, moved to lay Dixon’s motion to re-consider on the Table, Dixon withdrew his motion which was renewed by Lynn Boyd, with a Call for the Previous Question— This he withdrew at the request of Yancey, between whom, and his Colleague Hilliard the controversy of Praise and Blame, concerning the character and good name, of Daniel Webster, was renewed, with aggravated malignity, on the part of Yancey— Howell Cobb renewed his motion to lay Dixon’s motion for reconsideration on the Table, Daniel moved to go into Committee of the whole on Private Bills, but Haralson moved to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, which was carried Rathbun in the Chair, and the Bill from the Senate to raise a Regiment of mounted Riflemen and for the erection of Military Posts on the route to Oregon, for the protection of Emegrants was taken up, with the limitation yesterday adopted, of one hour for debate— Sundry Amendments were proposed—among which one by Felix G. McConnell to insert the word twenty before the word one, so as to make it a Bill to raise twenty-one Regiments, instead of one— Three other Members besides McConnell voted for this Amendment. Hugh White, of New York, moved that all the Officers, for the new Regiment should be selected of the regular Line, of the United States Army which was carried 78 to 71. Lewis. C. Levin of Philadelphia moved that the Officers and men, should be native Citizens of the United States— Rejected— Stanton moved to raise two Regiments instead of one. Rejected. Sundry other Amendments proposed, were also rejected and the Bill was reported with the Amendment proposed by Hugh. A. White, on which Amendment, the yeas and nays were taken in the House, and it was carried 89 to 82.

His narrative was not very clear, but amounted to this, that Mr. Webster, had sold, certain valuable Western Lands at prices not exceeding their actual value, the monies for the payment of which, were raised, by this subscription of his friends, and invested by the provision of an Annuity, for life. Made without his sanction or knowledge, and announced to him here, last month— This transaction, Mr. Webster considers, highly honorable to himself, and Mr. Winthrop concurs in that opinion— Upon this explanation, Yancey, commented, with merciless severity, and questioned, Winthrop, till he shrunk from the enquiries, with loathing and disgust; remonstrating, against such torturing scrutiny into the private affairs of a Public Man— Jacob Brinkerhoff called for the orders of the day, and the debate on the Bill from the Senate, to raise a Regiment of Mounted Riflemen, and for the construction of Military Posts on the route to Oregon, for the protection of Emegrants, was resumed— George Fries of Ohio had yesterday moved, to reconsider the vote, adopting Hugh White’s Amendment that all the Officers of the Regiment, should be selected from the United States Army, which Motion to re-consider was rejected, by yeas and nays, and after some further struggle the Bill was passed, 137. to 35— Cobb of Georgia moved a re-consideration, with a view to strike out this Amendment; which raised further debate, upon an assertion that there were now 90. supernumaOfficers, Finally the re-consideration was rejected by yeas and nays 85 to 95— Private Bills, were then taken up, and motion to re-consider the vote, rejecting the Bill, for the relief of the Heirs of Col. William Grayson, was again rejected, by yeas and nays 82. to 67— Three Private Bills were passed and after some debate upon the 4. it was also passed and the House adjourned— No evening visitors— "

Wherefore [“]Another parable put he forth unto them saying, the Kingdom of Heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field 32. Which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the Birds of the Air come and lodge in the branches thereof.” The Sermon, was an exposition of the doctrine of regeneration, as understood and represented by Emanuel Swedenborg. He did not enlarge; upon the correspondences, between the material and the spiritual world, which form the special character of the Swedenborg creed— He said little or nothing, of those millions of spiritual Beings, which Milton in the Paradise Lost says—“Walk the earth, and commune with us when we wake or when we sleep.[”] These lines appear to be the foundation of the spiritual system of Swedenborg but Mr. Barrett did not enlarge upon that part of the system. His argument was, from this Parable likening the Kingdom of Heaven to the growth of a mustard seed, proved that regeneration, could not be effected by a sudden, and instantaneous operation but must be accomplished by slow and gradual progress, like that of the process from the sowing of the seed, to the complete formation of the tree, and the ripening of the fruit borne by it— Mr. Barrett was not eloquent, nor animated. The auditory was rather thin and Mr. Milburn Chaplain of the House made the prayer— There was no singing— After dinner, at the 2d. Presbyterian Church the Revd. Matthew Hale Smith, preached from the second Sermon of his course, addressed to young women—from 1. Timothy 5–2. “Entreat the younger women, as sisters”— His Discourse, was plain, practical, and sensible;—distinguishing the virtues, and graces, peculiarly appropriate, to young women— The Address was earnest, affectionate and impressive occasionally to the drawing of tears— He gave notice, that on the next Sunday afternoon, his third Discourse, would be specially addressed to married persons— In his exhortations to young women, I thought they would have been more effective, if he had omitted, to include in his censures the reading of novels and dancing— These I suppose, are considered, as so inadmissible to all, Clergymen, of the Calvanistic Creed, that no Clergyman of that Denomination, can forbear to press them upon the conscience of his hearers— But the morals of the Age prevail so universally, over the discipline of that Church, that I believe it would be more profitable to the success of their Preachers, if they should forbear to notice them, altogether— The censorial power of the Church must, to have any good effect, accommodate itself liberally to the Spirit of the Age— I began reading this morning the 2. Book of Samuel, why so called I do not know, and think somewhat strange in as much as the death of Samuel, is recorded in the 25th. Chapter, of the first Book that bears his name— The 2nd. Book, is confined entirely to the History of David after the death of Samuel and of Saul— The life and History of Samuel, is remarkable, as forming the link between the History of the Jews as a Republic and a Monarchy— "

The House went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and took up, the Bill to protect the rights of American Settlers in the Territory of Oregon, until the termination of the Joint occupation of the same— Hannibal Hamlin of Maine in the Chair, The Bill, extends the jurisdiction of the Territory of Iowa over the whole of Oregon, without limitation of Boundary, beyond the Rocky Mountains— John. H. McHenry of Kentucky moved to insert the words, south of 49. degrees north.— This gave rise to a long debate in which I took part—observing that if the limitation was south of 54.40. I would vote for it, but was willing to leave it without specific limitation to the north— I refered again to my former voucher of the first Chapter of Genesis, as the foundation of Titles to Lands and produced, Grocius and Blackstone as refering to the same identical authority—Genesis 1.26–30.— I produced also, in the 1. Vol. of the Laws of the United States page 448. the commission of George III to Governor Wright of Georgia of the 20.

Cockey of Jno. and Thomas . . . Forest Baltimore Co. Maryland requesting my acceptance of them, as the workmanship of her own hands which I consider as a summons to my gallantry for a complimentary answer— I took this morning my answer to Joseph Sturge of Birmingham England to the Department of State, with a request, that it might be forwarded, to Mr. Lewis McLane, our minister in England, to be transmitted by him, to Mr. Sturge— I had a long conversation with Mr. Buchanan, upon various topics of Public concernment, and especially upon the occasional expenditure of the secret service money, and upon Mr. Buchanan’s desire, to obtain an Act of Congress constituting an Assistant Secretary of State— I stated to him my objections to this measure, upon general consideration and the imminent danger, of finding, in a Department with two heads a house divided against itself— I particularly referred him, to the result of an experiment, to establish an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, at the first organization of the present Government of the United States and the crosses, between Alexander Hamilton and Tench Coxe, till the Office of Assistant Secretary was abolished— At the House this was the day, fixed for the consideration of the Bill for the disposal, of the Smithsonian Bequest but at the motion of the Chairman of the Select Committee Mr. Owen, it was postponed to this day week, and a Bill relative to the duty on Java Coffee already fixed for that day, was postponed for another week— John. R. J. Daniel, of North Carolina, made a personal explanation, to correct what he stated to be erroneous Reports in the Intelligencer and Union Newspapers, of a Speech made yesterday by him in Committee of the Whole— William. L. Yancey, made also an explanation, in reply to that of Mr. Ashmun yesterday— Lynn Boyd of Kentucky moved a Resolution to close the debate, on the Bill to protect the rights of American Settlers in Oregon, Thursday next at 2 o clock P.M. which after sundry abortive motions for amendment, was adopted— That Bill, was then taken up in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Hannibal Hamlin in the Chair— While the House was in Committee, a message was received from the President, supposed to be an answer, to Charles. J. Ingersoll’s Secret Service call, upon which there was a prodigious curiosity to have it immediately read. But the Speaker, knowing it was not so, only took the Chair, to receive the message, and immediately redelivered it to Hamlin. Vinton of Ohio, Cobb of Georgia, and Holmes, of South Carolina, continued the debate, Milton Brown took the floor, and the Committee rose, McKay Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, reported the new ad valorem Tariff Bill— Objections to its reception were made and withdrawn— It was read only by its title. Andrew Stuart, moved that it be rejected—Jacob Collamer of Vermont—called for the reading of the whole Bill, the rule of the House being, that the first reading of a Bill, shall be for information— The Speaker decided, that the practise, of the House was, for the first reading to be by the title— From this decision Stuart appealed; which he afterwards withdrew. The rejection of the Bill was refused. it was read a second time by the title, I inquired if the Speaker had decided, that to read a Bill by its title, was reading it for information, as required by the rules of the House.— The Speaker said he had— I said, then the decision is directly in the face of the rule, you could as well pass the Bill now. It was referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union— Joseph Grinnell of the Committee on Commerce, reported a Bill supplementary to the Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen, and for other purposes, which was read and Committed, and the House adjourned. General Winfield Scott, was here this evening—and told me, that General Daniel Parker, who died, a few days since, was one of the two persons, who as General Scott, had informed me, on the day before Christmas 1844. were present, in February 1819. when I called upon General Andrew Jackson, to show him the Florida Treaty, then about to be concluded, and of which he then expressed his approval. In 1844. Jackson, had positively denied this fact which I had, as positively and repeatedly asserted. Scott told me, that these two persons, had separately informed him, that they were present, at this meeting, between Jackson, and me, in February 1819. but that he was not then at liberty, to disclose to me their names. He said he was intentionally obscure, as he was now, with regard to the survivor of the two persons— But I told him I knew who he was, his name having been given to me, by Waddy Thompson, our late Minister to Mexico— Whereat, General Scott was much amazed— But I did not give him the name, following his example, of being “intentionally obscure”— Mr. Samuel. L. Gouverneur, had furnished me with several original Letters, from General Jackson to President James Monroe, amply confirming, my statement of Jacksons approval, of the Florida Treaty which he in 1844. with such brazen face denied— "

President of the Washington College Pennsylvania, preach from Hebrews 10–38— “Now, the just shall live, by faith”— A Discourse not much above, common place, Calvanism, upon faith— Isaac Hull Adams dined with us— At 4. o clock in the afternoon I heard the Revd. Matthew Hale Smith, at the 2d. Presbyterian Church preach from Hebrews 13.4. “Marriage is honorable, in all” It was the 3d. of his intended four Discourses, and was specially addressed, to married persons— He gave notice, that the fourth and last Lecture of the series, would be delivered, next Sunday, in case of fair weather, and would be addressed to Parents— The House was very crowded, the auditory very attentive, and the Lecture, sensible, and edifying— In the evening, at the Unitarian Church, I heard the Revd. Henry W. Bellows of New York, preach, from Revelation, 2.4. “Nevertheless I have some what against thee, because, thou hast left, thy first love— 5. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works”—and for a second text, Luke, 8.5—[“]A sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it— 6.

And other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit, an hundred fold”— Mr. Bellows composition is in the first style of elegance, and in his exposition of this text I could not, but be amused, in comparing his with that of the preacher to the Tuscororo Indians, near Niagara, which I heard near Niagara in July 1843— Mr. Bellows argument, was, that moral excellence, the practise of doing good, was the great object, of the Christian dispensation— His Sermon, was one of the most eloquent, that I ever heard, but was, said, not to be equal, to that which he had delivered, at the same Church, this morning— The House was well filled, but not over flowing— Mr. Healey and Mr. Dubourjal, paid us eveg. visits— "

Espey, called on me this morning, and invited me, to go with him, and examine his instrument fixed on the top of the Capitol to ventilate, the Senate chamber—which I did—but understood none the better, its operation— Mr. Espey proposes, to fix a similar machine on the top of the Capitol at the other wing, for the ventilation of the Hall of the House of Representatives— At the House, the Bill making additional appropriations, to supply difficencies, in the appropriations Bills of the last Session, was received from the Senate, with Amendments Referred to the Committee on ways and means. This was the day fixed for the consideration, of the Smithsonian Bequest Bill, which at the motion of Mr. Owen, was postponed until tomorrow The re consideration of the vote asking a conferrence with the Senate, on the Oregon Notice Resolution having been yesterday carried the question now returned and it was again carried under the previous question by yeas and nays 126. to 50— The vote was taken before I reached the House and my name was therefore not recorded, upon it. Charles. J. Ingersoll—Robert Dale Owen, and H. W. Hilliard were appointed the conferrees on the part of the House— In Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, George. S. Houston of Alabama in the Chair, the Bill reported from the Committee on Indian Affairs, to regulate Trade and intercourse, with the Indian Tribes, in the Territory of Oregon, and to preserve peace, and cultivate friendship with and among the Indians, was resumed— Allen. G. Thurman of Ohio, Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, and James A. Seddon of Virginia, proposed and debated sundry Amendments to the Bill, as did Timothy Jenkins of the 20th. Congressional District of New York, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, and John W. Tibbatts of Kentucky— The Bill after much opposition was reported to the House, and postponed to the 2d. Monday of May. The House then adjourned by yeas and nays 98. to 67— No evening visitors—but the warm influences of Spring produced more than their usual operation upon my nervous system "

W. Jones of Tennessee, moved to strike out the first Section, that is to reject the Bill. Robert Dale Owen, delivered an hour Speech, in support of the Bill, dwelling chiefly upon the parts of it, appropriating Funds, to the education and training of teachers for Normal Schools—throughout the Union. In my opinion the worst feature of the Bill—Jones objection, was chiefly to the organization, of the Trustees of the Fund as a Corporation, which he contended was not within the Constitutional power of Congress, to create— After Owen’s Speech, Jones withdrew his motion to strike out the first Section, and moved to amend, by a Section authorizing the whole Bequest, to be returned, to the Heirs at Law, or next of kin, or residuary Legatees, of Smithson, or their authorized Agents, whenever they shall demand the Same— That is to say to deliver to them the State Bonds, of the state of Arkansas Illinois, and Michigan, upon which neither interest nor principal, is, or is soon likely, to be paid— This is Mr. Jones’ favourite mode, of disposing of a Fund, accepted by the Congress of the United States, with the pledge of their faith, that it should be appropriated to the purposes, prescribed; by the donor— This motion was discussed, by the mover, by Joseph R. Ingersoll, by F. P. Stanton of Tennessee, by William Sawyer of Ohio and by Jefferson Davis of Mississippi— After which the Committee rose without coming to any conclusion. Richard Brodhead of Pennsylvania, moved to discharge the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union from the consideration of the Bill relative to Licences to Canal Boats, the motion was carried and the Bill debated in the House till Samuel Gordon, moved that it be recommitted to the Committee of Commerce. On the question put there were ayes 47. noes 48. no quorum and the House adjourned— "

Porter, late of Niagara Falls, requesting a Letters of introduction for Mr. Porter who is going to Berlin to connect himself with its University for the purpose of continuing his studies He was graduated last Summer, with honor, at Harvard University— Mr. Holley requests me to send the Letters under the care of Mr. Abbott Lawrence Boston, before the first of next month, when Mr. Porter proposes to embark. I wrote Letters therefore, to Mr. Louis McLane, our Minister, and Colonel Thomas Aspinwall our Consul at London, and to Mr. William. R. King, Minister and Mr. Robert Walsh Consul, at Paris. I would also, have written to Mr. Henry Wheaton our Minister at Berlin but that he has been recalled, it is said at his own request— At the House, Lynn Boyd, moved a resolution to close debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the Smithsonian Bequest Bill, in half an hour, after after taking it up in Committee.— Joseph. R. Ingersoll, pleaded for an hour and a half, James Graham of North Carolina, moved to lay the resolution on the Table, which was done— And the House went into Committee again, Armistead Burt in the Chair, and resumed the consideration of the Bill.— Charles. J. Ingersoll, informed the House that the managers of the conference upon the Notice disagreement, had unanimously agreed upon a Report, but that it could not be communicated to this House, until it should have been acted upon by the Senate— George. P. Marsh of Vermont, made an hour speech upon the Smithsonian Bequest Bill— One of the best Speeches, ever delivered in the House, but not much in support of the Bill— His desire, is, to apply a very large portion, of the annual interest, upon the Fund, to the establishment of a public Library— Isaac. E. Morse, of Louisiana, to whom, Owen replied, and was followed by John. S. Chipman of Michigan, against the Bill— The Committee rose, and Owen moved a resolution to close the debate in Committee of the whole. Joseph. R. Ingersoll moved to amend by inserting three hours, but the resolution itself was laid on the Table, 93. to 44. Owen asked if a resolution allowing an hour and a half would be acceptable, I requested him not to renew the question in any form, as I wished to offer a substitute for the whole Bill— Objection was made to this, I moved a suspension of the rules which was carried— I proposed my substitute, which I had prepared this morning, it was referred to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, and ordered to be printed— The consideration of the Bill was then postponed to next Monday and the Bill relating to licences to Canal Boats, was taken up—and supported by a Speech by Mr. Joseph Grinnell— A message came from the Senate that the Senate had agreed to a Report of the Managers of the conference on the Oregon Notice resolution— The Report was then produced and read by Charles. J. Ingersoll, Chairman of the Committee of conference on the part of the House, on which Gentry of Tennessee made some remarks— John. A. McClernand of Illinois, asked to be excused from voting and assigns his reasons, which were it would be an instruction to the President, to compromise, on the Columbia River, and then withdrew his request to be excused— The Report of the Committee was accepted 142. to 46. George. W. Jones of Tennessee moved to reconsider, and the Previous Question—the reconsideration was refused without division and the House adjourned— We spent the evening with a party at Mr. W. W.

T. Paine, had fixed, within two seconds, the time of its commencement.— a prediction more accurate, than any other, that he had ever known, ten seconds having been considered, the nearest approach to perfect accuracy, attainable, by Astronomical observers— I met there, Mr. Charles Ashley a Member of the United States Senate, from the State of Arkansas, with his wife, and several other Ladies— I proceeded from thence, immediately to the Capitol where I found the House in Session.

Dr. Adams of New York City preached from Romans 15.4— “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have, hope”— The discourse, was an argumentative exposition of the whole text, showing how the Scriptures, of the Old Testament were adapted to teach the Christian reader by patience and of investigation, and the comfort derived through the perusal and study of them may be encouraged, to entertain the hope, of salvation and blessedness, in the future life— It was very ingenious, impressive, and eloquent— After dinner, at the Second Presbyterian Church, this day had been fixed, by Mr. Smith, for the delivery of the 4th and last, of his series of Lectures. The one addressed particularly to Parents—and the weather was so unpropitious the day consisting of a succession of showers, that he postponed the delivery of this Lecture till the next Sabbath—and preached upon Isaiah, 55–10— [“]For as the rain cometh down and the snow, from Heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth, and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; 11. So shall my word be, that goeth forth, out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me, void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper, in the thing whereto I sent it”— This was a very seasonable, discourse with reference, to the time of its delivery, and the analogies between the effects of the rain and snow described in the first verse, and the influences of the Holy Scriptures upon the happiness of mankind, ascerted in the second, were commented upon, and dilated sensibly, and judiciously by the Preacher— In the evening at the Unitarian Church I heard the Revd. Henry. W. Bellows of New York preach from John 15.11. “These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy, might remain in you, and that your joy might be full”— The drift of the Discourse was, that the mission of Christ upon earth was to promote, the happiness of mankind and that the text itself indissolubly connected the joy of the Redeemer, with the fullness of joy of his Apostles and of all his Disciples in all ages— It was full of instruction, and eloquence, but not quite so impressive, as that of the last Sunday evening— I met Mr. Bellows and his lady last Thursday evening at Mr. Seatons— On my return I found Mr. Healey and Mr. Dubourjal here.

V—  In the British House of Commons, on the 20th. last month, Lord George Benti a Son of the Duke of Portland, charged me, by name, for blasphemously, he would say, calling to my aid the word of God, as a justification for lighting up fire-brands and unleashing the Hell hounds of war, on as he called it “our” Territory of Oregon, and he proceeded to say “that if it came to this, that the Bible should be quoted for the title of the Americans to the Oregon Territory, he trusted, he would be enabled to address the Americans in the language of British thunder, from the broadsides of a Line of Battle Ship (hear, hear) and that they would send, British Seamen to the Seaboard of America, to speak in terms, that could not be misunderstood, and make assirtion of our rights (hear, hear)” The report of this debate is re-published, in several newspapers of this Country, and particularly in the Baltimore Sun, of last Thursday, the 23d. instt. I deem it my duty to reply to this charge, and if possible in my seat in the House of Representatives— But if done at all, it must be done with great deliberation, and in a written Speech— I began this morning the draught of this speech and I pray to God, for resolution, decision, and discretion to go through the fiery ordeal, of accomplishing it— At the House, Charles. J. Ingersoll, asked leave to make a personal explanation upon which objection being made, he moved and carried a suspension of the rules— George. Ashmun said he wished to move an Amendment to Ingersoll’s motion, which the Speaker said, could not be done— The suspension was carried out yeas and nays 102. to 25, and Ingersoll, delivered a new written attack upon Daniel Webster, for corruption, and embezzlement of Public money, and, delinquency in the settlement of his accounts, as Secretary of State— He concluded, by asking for a Committee which he said, he could not institute to test the truth of his statements— Ashmun asked leave to reply, and upon objection made, the rules were again suspended 125. to 22. and Ashmun did reply by a defence of Mr. Webster, and retorted, charges against Charles. J. Ingersoll in which process, he was repeatedly interrupted by calls to order, but sustained by the Speaker, and grossly insulted, by foul language, of charges of lying and cowardice, from Ingersoll— In the course of this debate, the Speaker decided that when all the rules of the House were suspended, the Parliamentary Law of England, was, still obligatory upon this House— I called upon him for his authority, in making his decision, he said it was my own, appealing to a decision, which he said I had made, while presiding over the House, at the first Session, of the 26th. Congress. I denied having ever made such a decision, and he did not attempt to produce it— I cannot find upon the Journal of the House, of that Session, any Question decided by me, which the Speaker, could even construe, into a precedent, for his decision of this day— Upon Mr. Ashmun’s pressing some of his charges against Charles. J. Ingersoll, he went over, to implore the assistance of his brother Joseph, to extricate him, from trouble; which he did, as far as he was able, with great propriety, and sensibility— This discreditable scene, closed, with a resolution offered by Mr. Schenck of Ohio, for the appointment of a Committee, of five members, to investigate the Question, how and in what manner, and by whom, Charles. J. Ingersoll had obtained secret documents, from the Department, of State, and report to the House, as soon as practicable the result of their investigation and by the appointment of another Committee also of five members, to inquire into the truth of the charges made by Charles. J. Ingersoll, against Daniel Webster with a view to founding an impeachment against him— The appointment of both Committees was carried and both have power to call for persons or papers, books and vouchers. Howell Cobb of Georgia, moved that all debate in Committee of the whole on the Smithsonian Bequest Bill, should cease in two hours, after it should be next taken up—but this was rejected after an abortive attempt to lay it on the Table— Two Messages from the President were received, with reports from the Secretary of War, relating to Treatise with the Choctaw Indians— The Messages were laid on the Table and the House adjourned— I took a walk after dinner.— The weather oppressively warm— We had evening visits from Mr. Mosely member of the House from the Buffalo District of New York, and Mr. Osburn, one of his Constituents— Mr. Mosely, has recovered.

C. Schenck of Ohio, James. C. Dobbin of North Carolina, Abraham. R. McIlvaine of Pennsylvania, Allen. G. Thurman, of Ohio, and John. A.

Stanton of Tennessee was appointed in his place— The use of the Hall was granted, for an exhibition of the blind pupils from the institutions of Boston, Philadelphia, and Virginia this evening— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Armistead Burte in the Chair, on the Smithsonian Bequest Bill Simms of South Carolina, opposed the Bill, in every shape and form, it could assume.— He held Congress had no power by the Constitution to accept such a trust, and was for returning the money, to the Chancery of England— I made a desultary speech, in support of the substitute, proposed by me, for the Bill— They were both debated, till the Committee rose without coming to a conclusion, and other amendments were proposed. George. W. Hopkins of Virginia, moved a resolution to close the debate in Committee of the whole, in one hour, after it should be next taken up, which was carried, by means of the Previous Question, and the House adjourned— Mr. John.

Marsh, moved sundry Amendments, the most important of which was, a Section appropriating $25000— a year from the interest of the Fund, for the formation of a Public Library— These amendments were carried and the Bill thus amended, was reported to the House, there under the Previous Question, it was passed to a third reading by yeas and nays 81. to 76. and then passed 85. to 76— At both which times, I voted in the affirmative— Owen, voted against the engrossment, but voted for the final passage— Thus nearly the whole proceeds of the Bequest are devoted to the annual accumulation of a great national Public Library. The best disposal of the Fund, which it has been practicable to obtain and which, at least to a great degree will I hope escape the usual fate of all benevolent Institutions of being degraded, into mere, jobs, for hungry speculation— The usual motion for reconsideration of the vote passing the Bill, was made by Mr. Owen and rejected without a division.

I spoke also of the wish of Mr. Kavasales, that he would refer to Commodore Smith for a report, concerning his character, instead of taking that, of Captain Geisinger; which he promised to do— My further conversation with Mr. Bancroft, was respecting our present relations and differences, with Great Britain, and especially, of the contest, for the possession of Oregon.

I attended accordingly and heard him preach from John. 9.35. part of the last clause of the verse. “Dost thou believe in the Son of God”— The Discourse without noticing the context, or the occasion upon which he spoke these words, to the man whose blindness he had cured by directing him, to wash, in the pool of Siloam and whom the Jews had cast out, for believing in Jesus— Mr. Furness commented upon the text as a general question, addressed, to his own Auditory observing there was even at this day very little, real, and practical faith, in true Christianity among its professors; that faith was like a Sabbath day garment, put on, and cast off one day in the week, and then he proceeded, to define, what he thought was true faith, which he considered, as a life, of obedience to the commands of Christ and not of any more speculative, metaphysical doctrines or opinions— After dinner, at the Second Presbyterian Church, the Revd. Matthew Hale Smith, delivered his fourth and last Lecture of a series, and which was addressed, to Parents—his text was, from Proverbs, 29.15. the last part of the verse, “A child left to himself, bringeth his mother to shame”— Mr. Dietz a member of this Society had applied to me, with a request, that I would preside at a meeting of the Society, to be held immediately after the close, of this course of Lectures, with a view, to pass a resolution of thanks, to Mr. Smith and a request to him of a copy of them for publication— To this I had consented and had prepared a resolution to be offered at the Meeting— But before the beginning of the Service this afternoon, Mr. Dietz came to my Pew and told me, that it had been agreed not to hold the meeting this afternoon— The Discourse, like the rest, of the series, was plain, sensible, and edifying, without attempt at pathetic eloquence— It consisted, chiefly, of observations upon the duty of Parents, with regard to the education of their children, and in exhortation, to that rigorous system, of parental discipline, prescribed, by the Proverbs of Solomon— A system undoubtedly best suited, to the Age, and Nation, over which he, ruled, but perhaps, best succeeded by a milder, and more affectionate system—at the present day— In the evening, I attended again at the Unitarian Church, and heard Mr. Furness of Philadelphia, from Luke 10–27—“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour, as thyself”— The subject was treated, as usual, by considering this text, as embracing the whole duty of Man— It comprises the whole system, of Christianity, but I should be glad to hear, from a Man like Mr. Furness, his exposition, of what is meant by the love of God, so emphatically enjoined in this text, and so remarkably dis-tinguished, from the love of the neighbour, with which it is connected— What is the love of God, and how is it possible, that a worm of the dust should entertain and cherish, and above all manifest, the passion of Love, for the Creator of the Universe. Reverence, adoration, fear, seem to be the emotions, natural, to the relations, between Man, and his Maker, and these are the sentiments, which I believe to be embraced, by the command of Jesus, in the text— The love of the neighbour, measured, by the intensity, of self love embed in the nature of Man, is a different sentiment though perhaps derived from the same source.— and perhaps still more imperative upon the practise of human life— "

As a remedy for this evil a “proviso” was introduced into the present Bill, which Cobb of Georgia moved, to strike out— The Members of the Post Office Committee, and two disputations Members, from Indiana, Pettit and Henley, differed so widely in opinion, upon this “proviso” that they debated it until for very weariness the Committee rose and the House adjourned.— Mr. Charles. B. King, was here this evening— The Steamer Cambria, stranded about midnight last Saturday on the Beach ofoff Cape Cod— She left Liverpool on the 19th. of April, but brings no very important news— "

Mr. McKay Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, offered in the House this morning, a resolution, that after this day, the House would daily take a recess from two to half past three o’clock P.M, and hold afternoon Sessions, objection was made, McKay moved to suspend the rules, which the House refused— Charles J. Ingersoll, called up a Bill reported from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, concerning the duties on Java Coffee, and tonnage duties on Spanish vessels— A debate ensued, in which Mr. Winthrop took a prominent part, until George S. Dromgoole moved the Committee to rise, which they did, whereupon he offered a resolution that any Member of this House, who has been, or may be summoned, to attend as a witness before the Circuit Court of the United States, for the District of Columbia, now sitting in the City of Washington has the leave of this House, during the present Session, to attend as a witness, in said Court, if he shall think proper to do so. He stated, that he had received information from his Colleague Hopkins that he had been suppened, to attend as a witness in the Circuit Court, held in this City in a case now pending before that Court; that his Colleague had no personal objection to attending, but wished the House to decide whether he was at liberty to do so— A considerable debate followed, in which I took a part and had some sparring with Mr. Dromgoole, by objecting to the general terms of his resolution, and contending that if any Member of this House, wished for permission to attend as a witness he should in Court of Justice he should ask for it himself. finally Armistead Burt of South Carolina, offered an amendment, that this House having been informed, that Mr. Hopkins one of its Members has been served with the process of the Circuit Court of the United States, now sitting in this City to attend as a Witness in the criminal proceeding pending in that Court, resolved that Mr. Hopkins have the leave of this House, to attend the Court, in which I acquiesced, and it was finally adopted, by yeas and nays 76. to 44— The Bill for supplying dificiencies of Appropriation came again from the Senate with Amendments, to which the House disagreed, and sent it back— A message was received from the President in answer to the resolution calling for copies of the correspondence of George. W. Gordon, late Consul of the United States at Rio de Janeiro, relating to the Slave trade in Vessels and by Citizens of the United States, between the Coast of Africa and Brazil. I moved the referrence of the Message and Documents to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, but a motion was made, and carried, that they be laid on the Table, and the motion to have them printed was refused— Another message was received from the President in answer to the resolution [“]whether any soldier or soldiers, of the Army of the U.S. had been shot for disertion or in the act of diserting and if so by whose order and under what authority”— Dromgoole moved that the Message and papers be laid on the Table.— I moved their referrence to a Select Committee— Haralson moved their referrence, to the Committee on Military Affairs— They were laid on the Table. A third message from the President was received, relating to Claims of Chickasaw Indians—which was also laid on the Table. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Lynn Boyd in the Chair, on the Jarva Coffee duty Bill, the debate upon which, was resumed—and after some altercation the Bill was passed and the House adjourned— "

I prepared this morning three resolutions and immediately after the reading of the Journal asked leave of the House to present them— McKay, at the same time moved, to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, by suspension of the rules.— I asked him to wai his move to give me the opportunity to take the question on mine— He declined, but the House refused to sustain his motion. My resolutions were read, first “A call on the President for the names of every Soldier in the Army, shot, without trial since the commencement of the present Session of Congress, and the names of the shooters whether Officer or Soldier”— Second— “A request that the President would cause to be arrested and tried by Court Martial, for murder, every Officer or Soldier by whom, or by whose order, any Soldier, of the Army, has been put to death, without a trial”—third “An instruction to the Committee on Military Affairs to inquire into the causes of the recent increase of disertions from the Army, and to report whether any further legislation by Congress, be necessary or expedient on that subject.” Immediately after the reading of the resolutions, Holmes of South Carolina said “I object I will vote for them when the War with Mexico is over”— I moved to suspend the rules, to enable me to introduce the resolutions, and called for the yeas and nays— A number barely sufficient for taking the yeas and nays, supported me, and the suspension of the rules was refused 45 to 90. Mr. Giddings of Ohio, moved to reconsider the vote taken yesterday—ordering the report of the Secretary of War, communicated with the Presidents Message, to be printed— It was merely a formality for bringing before the House, and the Country the real character of this transaction the shooting of deserters without a trial— He then stated the facts according to the report from the Secretary of War— At almost every sentence of his Speech he was interrupted by calls to order. but he did succeed in producing the Message from President Monroe of 8th. January 1820. in answer to a resolution from the House of the 14th. December 1819. concerning the shooting of a diserter by order of Col William King, and the proceedings upon the trial of Col King by Court Martial his conviction upon the charge, and the final Report of the Committee on Military Affairs of the House, requesting the President to strike Col King from the roll of the Army— But he could proceed no farther, the Speaker who upon the first calls to order had ventured, to sustain him, as in Order, finished by yielding to the calls of the slave mongers and declared him not in order—and he was silenced— This transaction, shows the present temper of the House, with regard, to the dismemberment of Mexico, by the foul and detestable conquest of Texas— I bow in submission to the inscrutable decrees of Providence, but humbly ask, why sleeps the thunder in the skies? Stephen Adams of Mississippi asked leave to introduce a Joint Resolution for adjourning the Session on Monday the 13th. of July—objection was made— He moved to suspend the rules, which was lost by yeas and nays 101. to 62—a majority not quite of two thirds— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Jacob Thompson of Mississippi in the Chair. The Post Office Appropriation Bill, was taken up and debated at some length, but to which I paid not sufficient attention, to know what it was about, but the Bill was finally reported to the House, and passed—whereupon the House adjourned— The utter indifference and coolness not only, in the House of Representatives but of the whole people, to this shooting of diserters without trial, is a sign of the times, which affects me, with a profound melancholy at their degeneracy and corruption Never before has such a state of things existed in this Country and it betokens a depravity of Public Morals, which in my firm belief, cannot escape, the judgement of Heaven, upon the Nation— Evening visit from Mr. John Connell— "

Daniel Willard, a descendant from the Willard family of Massachusetts and a travelling Bookseller was here this morning with a volume of Historical Collections of Virginia— A large Octavo volume, by Henry Howe, published a Charleston, South Carolina this present year, of which I took a copy for three and fifty cents. At the House Tibbatts of Kentucky of the Select Committee reported a Bill appropriating three Townships of Land to procure a Library of Books, for the benefit of the Blind.— It was referred to a Committee of the whole House, by yeas and nays, 103. to 54. After a struggle by Tibbatts, to pass it without commitment— He insisted that the appropriation being of Land and not of Money, the rule of the House that all proceedings touching Appropriations of Money, shall be first discussed, in a Committee of the whole House, did not apply— This day had been fixed, for the consideration of the Bill reported by the Committee on the District of Columbia to retrocede the County of Alexandria, to the State of Virginia— It was accordingly taken up, first in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Stephen. A. Douglass of Illinois in the Chair, and was warmly debated— The Chairman of the Committee, Robert M. T. Hunter, made a Speech, scarcely noting, the insurmountable objection against, the power of Congress, under the Constitution of the United States, to make this retrocession— Several petty Amendments were proposed and adopted or rejected, but the chief opposition to the Bill, was made by W. W. Payne of Alabama, between whom and Thomas. H. Bayly member from the Accomac District of Virginia—a violent altercation, with charges of impertinence, and defiance ensued. James McDowell, the new member from Western Virginia made an eloquent Speech, in favor of the retrocession— A controversy between Eastern and Western Virginia upon the basis of Slave or free representation, was involved in the discussion, but the Bill was carried triumphantly through the Committee; reported to the House, and passed under the Previous Question, by yeas and nays, 95. to 66. A formal Motion for reconsideration was rejected and the House adjourned— "

This is a sequel, to my resolutions, of last week, smothered in the same manner— Douglass of Illinois, asked leave to make a Report from the Committee on the Territories, but it was refused— John Pettit of Indiana, Chairman of the Select Committee, upon the impeachment of Daniel Webster, reported a Resolution, authorizing the Committee to sit during the Sessions of the House, and to employ a Clerk.— The request to sit during the Session of the House was granted, but that to employ a Clerk was rejected as was that of Robert C. Schenck, from the Committee of Investigation on Charles. J. Ingersoll, for the same permission— Pettit then asked, to be excused, from further service, on the Committee— Private Bills were again taken up, and a Bill for the allowance of the Bounty, on vessels engaged in the Cod Fishery to the Owner and Crew of the Schooner Success, wrecked without completing her voyage, was passed, by yeas and nays, 80. to 72, after a refusal to lay it on the Table 71. to 83.

                "text": "10— V—  In the Hall of the House of Representatives this morning I heard the Revd. Dr. Welsh of Albany, preach, from 2. Kings 5.12. “Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them and be clean. So he turned and went away in a rage” The Discourse was a curious exemplification, of the manner in which Democracy and demagoguism have crept into the Pulpit in this Country— The story of the cleansing of Naaman the Syrian is one of the most beautiful narratives of the Old Testament, but this preacher from Albany, turned it to political account. Its object in the Scripture is by a miraculous event, to display, the superiority of the religion of the Hebrews, over that of the Heathen Nations even of the conquerors of the Jews.— This is the perpetual object of all the Scriptures of the Old Testament— Naaman, Captain of the Host of the King of Syria, was a great man with his Master and honorable, because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria, he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a leper—A maurauding party of his Army had invaded the Land of Israel and carried off captive, a little maid, who waited on Naamans wife, and she said to her mistress would God, my Lord were with the Prophet, that is in Samaria, for he would recover him of his leprosy— So Naaman goes with a Letter from the King of Israel to the King of Syria with presents of immense value and the King thought, he sought to quarrel with him, but Elisha the prophet, went to the King of Israel, and requested he would refer Naaman to him. So Naaman came with his horses and Chariot and stood at the door of the House of Elisha, but did not condescend to see him, but sent a Messenger to him, directing him to go and wash in Jordan, and promising, that this would cleanse him from his leprosy— Thereupon Naaman flies into a passion and draws the comparison between the rivers of Damascus, and the waters of Israel.— selected by the Preacher for his text—and concludes by going away in a rage— Upon reflexion however by the advice of his Servants, he concludes to go and dip himself seven times in Jordan and is cleansed from his leprosy— He then returns to Elisha, the man of God, and acknowledges, that there is, no God, in all the Earth, but in Israel—and offers to Elisha magnificent presents; which he refuses. There is a sequel to the story, not less interesting than the tale itself, but of which Dr. Welsh took no notice, nor can I for want of time. But the Democracy of Dr. Welsh consisted in contrasting, the rank and pomp and grandeur of the Syrian Field Marshal, with the poverty and humility of the Hebrew Prophet— He commented much, upon the scorn, with which, the Grandee treated, the direction, of Elisha, and after many invidious contrasts, between the great and noble of the Earth, with the lowly condition of the Prophet, he finally concluded his Discourse by assuring his Auditory, that they might depend upon it, there was no aristocratic way to Heaven. After dinner I attended at the Second Presbyterian Church, where the Revd. Matthew Hale Smith, preached from Psalms 77–19—“Thy way is in the Sea, and thy path, in the great waters[”]—a sermon, upon the condition of Sailors— Immediately after the close of the Service, a Meeting of the Members of the Society was held, of which I, was Chairman and presented a resolution of thanks, for his four Lectures addressed to young men, to young ladies, to married persons, and to parents—with a request, of a copy of them, for publication. The resolution was unanimously adopted, the ladies of the Society according to the practice of this church, voting as well as the men. The meeting, occupied not more than a quarter of an hour, and was then adjourned— At half past seven in the evening I attended at the Unitarian Church, where the Revd. Samuel. K. Lothrop, Minister of the Brattle Street Church in Boston, preached from Genesis 37. part of the 15 verse. “What seekest thou,” This is a question put by a certain man to Joseph, when he was wandering in the field sent by his Father Israel, in search of his brethren, who were feeding their fathers flock in Shehem but Mr. Lothrop dismissed all notice of this context, but taking the simple question “What seekest thou,” by itself and applying it, specially to his Auditory, said he would address each one of them, with that question, and inquire what they were seeking— He said it was probable, that the ready answer of every one would be, he was seeking for happiness—and then he proceeded to shew, that happiness, was not, in itself, the proper object of search for the Christian— That this proper object was, the development of his own character; the pursuits of life; of which happiness would be the ultimate result: the practise of the virtues, and the control of his own passions, which would lead to happiness, and which require An earnest examination and search, for practical application, to the duties of human life— On returning home I found Lieutenant Thom, of the Topographical Engineers here—on a visit to the ladies— Mrs. Smith left us yesterday to go to her sister Mrs. Frye’s "

A voluminous correspondence, accompanied the message, When it was received, the House was in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Samuel Gordon, of the tenth Congressional District of New York, in the Chair, upon the Military Academy Appropriation Bill—against which William Sawyer of the fifth Congressional District of Ohio, was playing off, his democratic Artillery. On the receipt of the message, the Committee immediately rose.— The Message, and part of the accompanying Documents were read, and after some altercation as to the mode of disposing of them, they were ordered to be printed and referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— The House went immediately into that Committee at the motion of Hugh. A. Haralson, of Georgia Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs— George. W. Hopkins of Virginia, in the Chair— They immediately took up Bill No. 145, reported from the Committee authorizing the President to accept the service of volunteers, not exceeding fifty thousand men, with an Appropriation of ten millions of dollars.— A long debate ensued, numerous Amendments were proposed, a distinction between War and hostilities much discussed and numerous efforts made, to shape into a declaration of War, against Mexico, one of which finally succeeded— A motion was soon made, by Jacob Brinkerhoff of Ohio that the Committee rise, for a resolution to close the debate in two hours, upon which resolution the yeas and nays were demanded and refused— At the end of the two hours, the Bill was reported to the House, with the Amendment declaring War by a lying preamble adopted at the motion of Lynn Boyd, and was passed by yeas and nays, 174. to 14. Amos Abbott, and Robert C. Winthrop of Massachusetts voting for this declaration of War. Of the 14, besides myself, Ashmun, Grinnell, Hudson, and Daniel P. King were five— Benjamin Thompson and Julius Rockwell, were absent. There is one vacancy in the delegation from Massachusetts. Thus only one half of the delegation from Mass voted for this most unrighteous War. Garrett Davis of Kentucky, asked, to be excused, from voting, for which he assigned reasons, perfectly conclusive, against the War, and finally withdrew his motion to be excused, and voted for the Bill— Thomas. H. Bayly of Virginia, did the same— Elias B. Holmes of New York—Albert Smith of the same State also voted for the Bill, protesting against the preamble, as base, fraudulent and false— Which preamble contained the declaration of War— And thus the Bill was passed, and the House adjourned—  Washington Tuesday 12th.— May 1846— "

R. Giddings opposed the Bill, with an hour speech, interrupted by frequent calls, to order, after which a motion was made for the Committee to rise, The Committee rose, and the Chairman, Moses Norris, said the Committee had directed him to report the Bill— Which was not true— Burt who had moved for the Committee to rise, stated the fact, and said the reporter had erroneously made reported— Douglass of Illinois said “let it go as it is,” to this I objected— George. W. Hopkins, acting as Speaker, decided that the report was to be received as it had been made— Burt moved the Previous Question and the Bill was passed by yeas and nays, 153. to 9— A formal motion to reconsider, without yeas and nays called for by Rathbun but refused, and the House went again into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, Charles.

Winthrop moved to amend it to take the recess till 10. o’clock this evening— After several unsuccessful motions to adjourn Thurman’s motion to take the recess was carried, 67. to 65— At the meeting after the recess, a Letter was presented to the House, from John Pettit Chairman of the Select Committee of Investigation for the impeachment of Daniel Webster, stating that after having been refused the service of a Clerk for that Committee by the House he had concluded, to refuse to serve any longer on that Committee and therefore asked again to be excused, and that another person may be appointed in his place— He was accordingly excused and Seaborn Jones of Georgia was appointed in his place— Pettit was the mover for this Committee, with the avowed purpose of impeachment, of Mr. Webster— Having carried that motion, the real purpose of which was, to force the production of the secret papers, in the Department of State, he takes the first opportunity to get excused from serving on the Committee, well knowing that no impeachable matte, will be obtained by the investigation but trusting, that the publication of the secret papers, would operate injuriously upon the reputation of Webster in the Public mind— The whole of this transaction affords an exemplification, of the manner, in which the secrets of this Government, are divulged, by the operation of factious Parties and malicious personal enmities— Message was received from the Senate, returning the Bill declaring war against Mexico, passed by them with Amendments—which were concurred in, almost without opposition—. . . A final formal vote of reconsideration was made and rejected, and between eight and nine oclock the House adjourned and I came home with a heavy heart. "

Morning employed, in writing, with a view to retrieve if possible the arrears of this Journal, which are growing like the leak in an unseaworthy Ship— At the House, Isaac. E. Holmes of South Carolina Chairman of the Committee of Naval Affairs presented a communication from the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to the Engineers, for the Revenue Marine Service— Holmes moved to discharge the Committee of the whole House from the consideration of a Bill upon this subject, referred to them, and take it up and pass it, in the House—which was accordingly done, though in direct defiance, of a rule of the House, that all matters touching appropriations of money shall be first considered in Committee of the whole— This Committee of the whole, is in our theory of Legislation, the great security for the freedom of Speech, and of debate, upon all subjects before the House, but it is becoming little more than a dead Letter by this evasive practise, of referring subjects to the Committee, and then discharging the Committee from the consideration of them, without and consideration at all— This together with the other recent practise, of limiting the time, for debate in Committee of the whole, takes away, all the benefit of free debate intended, by that organization of the rules. The Committee was accordingly now discharged and the Bill was taken up in the House. It provides for the appointment of Officers in the Revenue Service, by the President by, and with the consent of the President.— Hitherto they have been appointed by the President alone— It establishes a new rank, of third Lieutenants, hitherto unknown in our Service, provides for additional Engineers, of Steamers, and increases the wages of boatswains gunners and carpenters—to thirty five dollars a month and one navy ration a day.— George Rathbun, moved to recommit the Bill, to the Navy Committee, with instructions to report a Bill to transfer the revenue Marine vessels to the Navy Department, which after desultory debate, was carried, 86 to 35— James. G. Hampton of New Jersey presented resolutions of the Legislature of that State, one of which was against any alteration of the Tariff— Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, Charles. S. Benton, of the 17th. Congressional District in the Chair, Military Academy Appropriation Bill was taken up, ten minutes allowed for debate were consumed by Samuel Gordon. Rathbun’s proposal to abolish the Academy was rejected 50 to 94. and the Bill was passed. The Army Appropriation Bill followed, the chief debate upon which was a proposal, to raise the pay, of Private Soldiers from eight to ten dollars a month— About four o clock the Committee of the whole rose without taking the Question and the House adjourned— The Marine Band of Music played in the garden of the President’s House. I walked out and entered the Garden just as they were closing their performances with the air of Yankee Doodle. After returning home, Mr. Larned, together with Mr. Tracey from Boston paid us evening visits. "

Mr. Kavasales was here this morning, and I had the unpleasant task to perform, of telling him, that the report of Commodore Smith, to whom at his request, the Secretary of the Navy Mr. Bancroft, had written for a report concerning Mr. Kavasales, was not so favorable as I had expected and hoped— That it contains no charge against him, of any specific misconduct, but merely an opinion of his incompetency, to exercise the functions of a Chaplain— I regretted this circumstance very much because it weakens the hope, of any kindness, on the part of the Secretary of the Navy. I believe him fully competent, to the duties of that Office, though perhaps well adapted, to exercise it on board of a Man of War at Sea— He wished me to intercede for an appointment at a Shore station which I promised him to do— I received a few days since a Letter from Dr. C. C. Cox of Easton, Maryland; inviting me to deliver a Lecture, before the Ladies of that place, to contribute to the purchase of an Organ, for a magnificent Episcopal Church, recently constructed there— I answered his Letter this day, declining the invitation on account of my health, and a repugnance to be absent from my Public duties for a single day— At the House, Erastus. D. Culver, of the 14. Congressional District of New York, offered a resolution, to instruct the Committee on Elections to inquire into the propriety and justice, of allowing, John Talliaferro the pay of a member while engaged in contesting the Seat of John Hungerford in a former Congress, the Seat having been awarded to Mr. Taliaferro. But the resolution was not received, nor was that of Richard Brodhead 10th. Congressional District of Pennsylvania, for printing extra Copies of the President’s war Messages, against Mexico, received on Monday and Tuesday last— Brodhead moved a suspension of the rules, but it was refused. The Military Academy Appropriation Bill, was passed 90. to 41— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union on the Army Appropriation Bill— Howell Cobb of Georgia in the Chair, which George. W. Jones of Tennessee and William L. Yancey of Alabama declined. The Army Appropriation Bill, was taken up. James A. Black of South Carolina moved an additional section fixing the pay of the troops the same as that now allowed to the Dragoon Regiments— Tibbatts moved as an Amendment to raise the pay of private Soldiers, from eight to ten dollars a month— Upon this Allen. G. Thurman, the 8th. Congressional District of Ohio made a violent Speech, in reply to that of Mr. Giddings made on yesterday— Leonard H. Simms, of Missouri, followed in the same strain— Charles Hudson, made a spirited speech on the other side, after which the Bill was laid aside and the Fortification Bill was taken up with Amendments from the Senate, which were concurred in, on which the Committee rose, and after a referrence of two other Bills to Committees, the House adjourned— I called this evening at the House of Mr. Bancroft, Secretary of the Navy— I found with him Mr. Walker Secretary of the Treasury— Mrs. Bancroft was riding out, and while I was there came in. Mr. Charles. J. Ingersoll came also, just as I was taking my leave and on returning home I found Mr. John Connell here "

                "text": "15. V—  My call at Mr. Bancroft’s last evening, was occasioned, by a poor insane man named William Winthrop Allen, who had me called out from my seat in the House yesterday morning and inquired, if I had received two or three months since, a Letter from him, with a Memorial, claiming the sum of thirty thousand dollars, as due from the United States to him. I did not recollect having received such a Memorial but inquired upon what ground he made this claim— He then told me a wild incoherent story, of a conspiracy against his life carried on for a series of years, as indemnity for which, he had applied to the Legislature of Massachusetts, which had refused to do him justice, and thereby gave him this claim upon the United States, whose duty it was to indemnify him by compelling the Legislature of Massachusetts to do him justice. I enquired how he came here, and drew from him the acknowledgment, that he had been placed by his friends in the Alms House, of the Town of Medfield, though he was a preacher of the Gospel, and a Teacher of School— That from the keepers of the Alms House, he had obtained a permission to go to Boston, and had availed himself of that opportunity to come here to prosecute his claim— I assured him, that he could obtain nothing by a memorial to Congress, and advised him to return immediately home— He thanked me for my advice and appeared well disposed to follow it—but he said he would call tomorrow, on Mr. Bancroft, who had been his Classmate, at Harvard University. Immediately after he left me at the House I spoke of him to Mr. Winthrop, and called at Mr. Bancrofts in the evening to notify him, of the visit he would receive from this poor man tomorrow. I proposed, that we should consult together upon the means, of prevailing upon him to return to Medfield— He is perfectly harmless, and eminently deserving of compassion— At the House, Columbus Delano asked leave to make a personal explanation, but objection was made and persisted in, till after moving a suspension of the rules, he withdrew his motion and gave it up. McKay moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union on the Army Appropriation Bill, John. R. Daniel of North Carolina moved to take up the Private Callender, which was carried— A Bill for the Heirs of Capt Larkin Smith, reported by the Committee of the whole for rejection, was rejected— Barkly Martin of Tennessee moved again the suspension of the rules to allow Mr. Delano to make his explanation which was carried— Delano complained, that his Colleague Thurman had misrepresented him, by charging him with having said, that the War with Mexico, was a “damnable War.” Thurman replied, and the debate fell into a mere question about the use of particular words, and ended in nothing. Then came up again, a Bill for the allowance, of the usual Bounty of the Fishing Schooner Tancred, lost at Sea, which was specially opposed by Daniel of North Carolina, and on the engrossment of which the vote was 82 to 80. Daniel then moved, a call of the House, which was refused and the Bill was passed 85 to 82, Committee of the whole on Private Bills again. Solomon Foot of Vermont in the Chair. Among the Bills taken up was one for the relief of Thomas Ap Catesby Jones, for certain expenses, for services of a diplomatic character at the Sandwich and Otaheite Islands— Garrett Davis, from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, moved an Amendment, authorizing the Secretary of State under the direction of the President to settle and adjust the claims of Benjamin. E. Green for compensation as Chargé d’Affairs at Mexico, and William. M. Blackford for the same Office at Venezuela— Upon which a desultory debate followed, till about half past three the Committee rose for lack of a quorum and the House adjourned— "

He is to preach again in the Unitarian Church tomorrow and he proposes to leave this City on his return homeward next Wednesday— Mr. Lewis Johnson was also here, with a Letter from Mr. Joseph Otis New Orleans, relating to the final distribution of the proceeds, of the claim left by the late William Otis, not yet completed. I gave to Mr. Johnson a Letter for him which I had received last evening, from Mr. John Otis of West Barnstable relating to the same interest. Mr. Johnson informed me, that his connexion with Mr. Callen of a joint Agency Office, had been dissolved in the month of January of the last year.— Morning visits also from Mr. Charles Hudson, with a Mr. Snell from Boston, who claimed an acquaintance with me of many years standing but which had passed away from my memory. At the House Daniel of North Carolina offered a resolution, to establish a rule, for compelling the Members to vote in Committee of the whole House, so as to secure a quorum by directing the Clerk that whenever there shall be no quorum voting to call over the roll, and to deduct a day’s pay for every member who shall not answer at the call of his name unless he shall make it appear to the satisfaction of the Speaker, that he was necessarily absent from the House— Objection was made. Daniel moved to suspend the rules, upon which the vote was 72. to 70— A majority but not two-thirds, whereupon Daniel declared his intention to persevere impressing this revolution, till he shall get a fair vote of the House upon it— The House had returned to the Senate, the Bill to raise a Regiment of Mounted Riflemen and for the construction of Military Posts on the route to Oregon, with an Amendment providing that all the Officers of the Regiment should be selected from the regular Line of the United States Army. To this Amendment the Senate disagreed, and the House now at the motion of Haralson, receded from it 96. to 69— I had not reached the House when the vote was taken— Thomas. B. King of Georgia, moved a call upon the Secretary of the Treasury, for a statement of the condition of the revenue Service—which was carried. An Order to print ten thousand copies extra, of the War Message against Mexico was adopted at the motion of Charles. J. Ingersoll— Brodhead offered a resolution calling on the Secretary of State, for the accounts of Benjamin F. Green and William. H. Blackford as Secretaries of Legation and Charges d’Affairs or Bearers of Dispatches which was adopted with an Amendment proposed by me to specify the items of account objected to by the Department— Committee of the whole on Private Bills. Solomon Foot of Vermont in the Chair. Sundry Private Bills were discussed and laid aside to be reported for adoption or rejection. After which the Committee rose, and the House adjourned. Evening visit from Lieut Thom— When I took my seat in the House this evening I found on my Table, a beautiful nosegay of fresh flowers, with a card bearing the name of Mrs. John Pettit of Indiana and the words “For Hon John Q. Adams”— Mrs. Pettit is the wife of a very eccentric Member of the House from the State of Indiana. With her I have no personal acquaintance and with him no community of sentiment, or opinion— I think I never saw her, unless she may have been a visitor here on last New Years day— I hope it is no unworthy feeling, to be deeply affected, by testimonials, such as these— I therefore wrote immediately, to Mrs. Pettit, returning my thanks, with entire simplicity for her present— "

Mr. Tustin, the Chaplain to the Senate, would preach in the Hall of the House of Representatives this morning— I attended there as usual, but instead of Mr. Tustin a stranger whose name I did not here preached from Gallatians 6.5. [“]For every Man shall bear his own burden,”—a text, which suggested to me many reflections, I hope not altogether unprofitable but far from pleasing or satisfactory, but upon which, the exposition of the preacher made so little impression, upon my mind, that it has left scarcely a trace upon my memory— Whether this, is chargable, upon the Revd. Sermonizer, or upon myself, I am unwilling to pronounce, perhaps upon both. My state of mind being very ill suited to give the due attention to any thing, not peculiarly exciting, from the Pulpit— In the Afternoon at the 2d. Presbyterian Church, I heard the Revd. Matthew Hale Smith from 2. Timothy 4.7. the last clause of the verse—“I have kept the Faith.” Mr. Smith, related the melancholy circumstances, under which the great Apostle of the Gentiles wrote, this Epistle, to his friend and convert Timothy. The note at the end of this Epistle states, that it was to Timotheus ordained first Bishop, of the Church of the Ephesians, and was written from Rome, when Paul, was brought before Nero, the second time. Mr. Smith said that it was written when he was under sentence of death. Upon what authority he said that, I know not, but there is internal evidence in the Epistle itself that it was written, before the sentence had been passed upon him— He complains, that upon his first Trial, he had been forsaken by all men,—but that he was delivered, out of the mouth of the Lion, and he expresses a confidence, that the Lord shall deliver him again and preserve him unto his Heavenly Kingdom— He urges Timothy to come shortly to him, and requests him to bring with him, his cloak, books, and parchments— Requests him especially to come before winter—and though he declares, he is ready to be offered, and the time of his departure, is at hand, there is nothing in the Letter, which intimates that the decision against him, had been pronounced. The principal argument of Mr. Smith was however upon the words of his text—“I have kept the Faith” and explaining by the context, the meaning of the words, he drew from them an exhortation to his Auditory, to follow the example of the Apostle, and keep the Faith, to the last moment of life, through every event that can befall the frailty of human nature— The Rev Mr. Lothrop of Boston preached at the Unitarian Church this morning and evening, but the weather was so uncomfortable, raining almost the whole day that I did not attend in the evening to hear him— "

Mr. Kavasales was here this morning, he still entertains the hope, of receiving an assignment to a shore station at Norfolk, in Virginia, or at the Navy Yard, at this place—and I promised to solicit it for him, if I should have an opportunity of seeing the Secretary of the Navy. Henry St John of the 6th. Congressional District of Ohio, at the House, by a suspension of the rules, offered a resolution which was adopted, calling on the Secretary of War, for a report at the earliest practicable period of the result of the examinations by the Officers of the Topographical Bureau, of the Harbour of Sandusky Bay, on Lake Erie, with a plan of the Chief of that Bureau, for the improvement of that Harbour. McKay, Chairman of the Committee of ways and means, moved a resolution for closing the debate, on the Army Appropriation Bill, at 2. o clock P.M. tomorrow— Which after abortive motions to lay it on the Table and to amend it, by substituting this day and next Thursday was adopted as proposed by McKay— David. S. Reid of the 3d. Congressional District of North Carolina moved to suspend the rules, for a motion to meet hereafter at 10. oclock A.M. The vote was 93. to 82. a majority but not two thirds to suspend the rules— The Bill to regulate trade and intercourse, with the Indian Tribes in Oregon had been fixed for consideration this day but was postponed, to the first Monday, in June, for the Senate to act in the meantime, on the Bill sent from this House, to protect the rights of American Citizens, in the Territory of the United States, west of the Rocky Mountains and for other purposes, commonly called the Jurisdiction Bill, which it is very doubtful whether the Senate will pass at all— Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, Howell Cobb of Georgia in the Chair, on the Army Appropriation Bill— Tibbatts’ motion, to increase the pay of private Soldiers, from eight to ten dollars a month, was further debated, but the discussion immediately slided into the justice and expediency of the War with Mexico, upon which Henry Grider of the 3d. Congressional District of Kentucky made an hour speech, complaining of the manner in which both Houses of Congress, had been forced into the Declaration of War with Mexico, by blending it with measures, necessary to extricate the Army under General Taylor, from the desperate position, into which they had been drawn, by the order to march at once, to the mouth of the Rio del Norte— A resolution, for continuing, the temporary provision, for the Mail service in Texas, was received from the Senate and passed after discharging the Committee of the whole to which it had been referred— A motion to adjourn, was rejected, without a quorum McKay moved to take up the Amendments of the Senate, to the Indian Appropriation Bill. I objected to doing any business without a quorum, and moved a call of the House, which was refused, but they adjourned— There were this evening many shouts of victory and two or three half cannonades of triumph for reports, that General Taylor had defeated the Mexicans, at the mouth of the Rio del Norte and totally destroyed the town of Metamoras on the south side of the river with a population of about nine thousand inhabitants and so defenceless that its destruction is said to have been accomplished in the space of half an hour— "

Secretary of the Historical Society of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; enclosing two printed papers one the first report of that Society of which Mr. Phillips is the Secretary of the 4th June 1845, and the other a printed Circular Letter of the 5th. of September 1845, signed by David L. Swain, eight Members of the executive Committee, and the Secretary— Mr. Phillips Letter, referring to page 275; of the Appendix, to the first volume of my Father’s Letters published by my Son.— The note B. thoughts on Government, states, that the manuscript of my Father, communicated in 1776. to the Legislature of North Carolina, has been recently presented to that Society by Miss Burke, a daughter of Mr. Burke who was in 1776. Chairman of the Committee appointed to project a Constitution, and afterwards Governor of the State— That he died in 1783, and that it is almost certain that from that year, up to 1845. the boxes which contained his papers remained unopened— They were then presented by Miss Burke to the Historical Society; and that among them was discovered one, endorsed in Governor Burkes hand-writing John Adams—Thoughts on Government— Mr. Phillips, on the part of the Historical Society tenders me a copy of this paper and remarking that the Society has been in existence only two years, in very obliging terms proposes to place my name on its records as its first honorary member— I am extremely gratified with the reappearance of these “Thoughts on Government.” though doubtless only a copy, of the Letter to George Wythe, published in my son’s collection, and many times before— At the House, we went immediately into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and resumed the consideration of the Army Appropriation Bill, that is to say, of the War with Mexico, which was continued till 2 o clock P.M. when the debate closed, and the voting upon Amendments commenced. Tibbatts modified his proposed Amendment, concerning pay emoluments, and bounties of volunteers— McKay objected to the Amendment as not in order— The Speaker decided accordingly, Tibbatts appealed from the decision, which was sustained by the Committee 97. to 25— After the adoption and rejection of sundry amendments, the Bill was reported to the House, and passed by 191. without one negative. The appropriation, is little short of seven millions. Sundry Bills relating to the disposal of the public Lands, were reported, and some other business of form transacted, when R. M. T. Hunter Chairman of the Committee of the District of Columbia, moved to fix Friday and Saturday of next week, for the business of the District, without deciding upon which, the House adjourned— The glorious news from the Army, received yesterday, was with some immaterial variations confirmed this evening— Of which we were informed this evening, by Lieutenant Thom— "

Nourse, informed me, that he had ready for me, one Cincinnati Bond— I began writing an answer, to the Letter from Mr. Charles Phillips, Secretary, of the Historical Society of the University of North Carolina, but had not time to finish it— I have received also a Letter from W. D. Coolidge, Boston, inviting me to attend the annual Collation of the Unitarian Association, at that place— Which is to be, on Tuesday next— I deposited at the Bank of the Metropolis, a check yesterday received from the Speaker— At the House, the speaker decided, that a resolution proposed yesterday by Haralson Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs for an Appropriation of money, to purchase a Book of tactic and the Articles of War, for the use of volunteers, was not in order, because every appropria-tion from the Treasury, must by the Constitution be made by Law, that is by Bill and not by resolution— This decision was correct, but these appropriations by resolution are so frequently occurring that this principle of the Constitution will very soon, be broken down entirely— It has already in more than one instance, been violated and was especially so, in one case, in the 27th. Congress, against which I remonstrated, in vain— The business of the Territories had been fixed, as the special order, for this and the two succeeding days—but was postponed to the three first Legislative days of June— Andrew Stuart of Pennsylvania, moved to suspend the rules, to instruct the Committee on Military Affairs, to report a Bill increasing the pay of Volunteers from 7. to 10. dollars a month, and promising one hundred and sixty Acres of Land to every one who shall serve to the end of the War or die in the service. The vote for suspending the rules, was 70. to 75. Thomas Butler King, from the Committee on Naval Affairs, reported a Bill, for constructing twelve iron War Steamers of not less than twelve hundred, or more than sixteen hundred tons each,—of a speed not less than fifteen miles an hour and one iron Frigate to carry sixty heavy guns— With an appropriation of five millions of dollars— Referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union with the report and documents, to be printed— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Bill— James. B. Bowlin of Missouri in the Chair— Orvil Hungerford, of the 19th. Congressional District of New York, moved to strike out, an appropriation of two thousand dollars for a meteorologist, that is to say, for Dr. James. P. Espy, who in that capacity, has been quartered in the War Department— Hungerford objected, that it was not in order, in the Bill, inasmuch, as there was no, Law, authorizing the employment of a meteorologist— For several past years, the Appropriation has been made, in the form of a contingency for continuing Meteorological observations, for various Army Stations— The Speaker said that it was not for him, but for the House to decide, if the appropriation was not in order— A long debate was started, on the motion to strike out the word Meteorologist, the vote upon which, by Tellers, was 46 to 53. no quorum— I called for another count but the Committee rose, and reported rose and repor no quorum. A motion to adjourn was made and upon the call for yeas and nays withdrawn— McKay moved a call of the House— Refused 53 to 85, a large quorum, and the House went again into Committee— Hungerford’s motion to strike out Meteorologist, was lost 61. to 65— After some further debate the Committee, rose, and George. S. Houston, of Alabama gave notice, of a Joint resolution, providing for, a one sided commission, of American citizens, to adjust, and determine, the amount of claims, of citizens of the United States, against the Government of Mexico— Sundry other reports were received and sundry resolutions of state Legislatures and Private Memorials, were presented, till soon after three o clock the House adjourned— Major Graham and Mr. Calvin Colton paid us evening visits— Mr. Coltons Life and Times of Henry Clay, has been published several months in two Octavo volumes, and the exposure of the real bargain, offer’d by General Jackson to Mr. Clay in February 1825. remains without reply— "

Mr. Kavasales was here this morning—but I had not seen the Secretary of the Navy, since he was here before and could give him no word of encouragement— The disposition of the Secretary, Mr. Bancroft, is in nowise congenial with his former profession, as a Minister of the Gospel— He in nowise favors the establishment of Chaplains in the Naval Service, and seems to think, that Seamen have nothing to do with religion, and that the abolition of all religious services, from the Navy of the United States, whether in the Land or on the Sea, might be the most expedient policy— At the House, a Bill was introduced by George Rathbun for making copies of papers, certified by the Secretary of the Senate, or the Clerk of the House of Representatives, lawful evidence in the Courts of Justice in the States, which Bill was passed and sent to the Senate— W. W. Payne of Alabama, moved to discharge the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, from the consideration of a Bill to amend and continue in enforce the Act to incorporate the inhabitants of the City of Washington which was done and the Bill was taken up in the House— The previous Question upon its engrossment, was rejected— R.

Showing 131. members present—112. making a quorum. The House thereupon went again into Committee and resumed the debate— Grover of New York spoke three or four times, whereupon Dromgoole appealed to the rule that no member should speak more than twice to the same question without leave of the House, nor more than once, until every other member choosing to speak, shall have spoken. Motion was made that Grover should have leave to speak again. Vote 45. to 21. no quorum—whereupon the House adjourned— "

When I was there in September 1840. we passed a Sunday at that place—and in the afternoon of that day, I took a ride with this gentleman, and his brother, of four or five miles, to see a tract of Country, reclaimed, from the Sea, in the Town of Cornwallis— This is the second person, of those whom we met on that day, who has strolled thus far, on a visit to the States; without any other apparent motive, than curiosity— At the House, Isaac. E. Holmes of South Carolina Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, reported back a Bill from the Senate, referred to that Committee, repealing the proviso in the Navy Appropriation Act limiting the number of petty Officers, Seamen, Landsmen, and boys, to 7500. with an Amendment,—which was passed, and the Bill returned, to the Senate— Robert McClelland of Michigan Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, reported a Bill for allowance of drawback, on articles imported from the British North American Colonies and exported to Foreign Countries which after some feeble obstruction was passed and sent to the Senate— The House was thin, and a quorum failing Meredith. P. Gentry of Tennessee, moved to adjourn over to Monday, to give the members of the House the opportunity to visit the great National Fair of American Manufactures, which commenced yesterday, but his proposition was rejected 65 to 93— Committee of the whole on Private Bills, Charles Hudson, in the Chair— The first and fourth Friday in each month, are assigned for the consideration of Bills, to which no objection is made, and if as they are called over any one member objects and persists in the objection to any Bill it must be passed by— Eight Bills were thus called, without objection. At last a Bill for the relief of Ann and L. Dana and Co. was called, and objected to by Wm. Sawyer of Ohio— It was passed over, and another Bill, taken up without objection after which Sawyer withdrew his objection, which George S. Houston of Alabama insisted he could not do, the Committee having no power to step backward. The Chairman decided that the Bill should be reported to the House, from which George. W. Jones of Tennessee appealed, and after three votes without a quorum the decision of the Chairman was sustained— Jones thereupon objected to all the Bills which had been laid aside to be reported, which the Chairman decided was not in order— Eighteen Bills were called up, and objected to. James A. Black of South Carolina moved the Committee to rise and report the Bill as passed upon—no quorum voting— The Committee rose and reported the fact John R. J. Daniel of North Carolina moved a call of the House Vinton of Ohio moved to adjourn— Refused 30. to 74— No quorum— Daniel’s motion for a Call was then rejected, and the House adjourned— Evening Party at Mr. Grinnells and Mr. Winthrop’s—to which I went alone the Ladies all sending excuses— I met there many strangers visiting the City to see the Fair, and otherwise— Among the rest Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Appleton, and others from Boston— I remained but a short time, being myself quite unwell— "

Coolidge’s Letter Boston—inviting me to attend at the annual Collation, of the Unitarian Association, Boston next Tuesday—which I am of course obliged to decline— At the House, David. S.

Davis, the present Speaker of the House of Representatives— If his vote would have rejected the Bill by making a tie, he would not have given it, but when the Bill was rejected, by a tie, he would have added his own vote, to make the assurance of rejection, doubly sure— Some question was made whether after the announcement, that the Bill was passed, it was not too late, especially by such a questionable procedure, to reverse the decision— Other objections were made, to the voting of the Speaker, but without any result, except to show his passion for the strongest side— The House adjourned between two and three o clock, and I walked round and visited the Fair— After dinner I walked again to the Capitol, where the Musicians of the Marine Band, were performing— I expected to find the ladies with the Carriage there but was disappointed, and had to walk home— Mr. Hague the astrologer was here in the evening with many mysterious prophetic givings out, which he promised, to explain to me, some day next week, but which as usual amount to nothing— An Indian of the Stockbridge Tribe, by the name of John Quinney was also here— "

Almost all the others are still in the rotundo Besides these, he has made also for the King of France copies of several other portraits of persons, distinguished in our Revolutionary History and among them of Gilbert Stuarts portrait of my Father, painted while he was President of the United States, which is at Quincy with the portrait of my mother by the same Artist— That of my Father, was borrowed of me by Mr. Healey and kept by him several weeks— Mr. Healeys companion Dubourjal has already left this place "

Buchanan to his mother, from the Field of Battle, in the Rio Grande— The second of them being written on a sheet of paper taken with the Camp equipage of the Mexican General Arista— The route of the Mexican Army was complete, and they retreated beyond the river— At the House, Jacob Brinkerhoff of Ohio, was very impatient, to take up his resolution of thanks to General Taylor and his Army, which he had offered yesterday, but consented to wait for the Message from the President, with the Official despatches— The Civil and Diplomatic appropriation Bill was taken up and Lynn Boyd’s motion, to introduce an additional Marine Hospital at Paducah, came up again, and produced another stubborn debate. Crozier of Tennessee, Houston of Alabama, Stanton of Tennessee, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, who renewed his motion to insert Natchez, Wentworth of Illinois, Darragh of Pennsylvania, James. F. Faran of Ohio, and James. B. Bowlin of Missouri, discussed, the insertion of various places, till Martin Grover, of New York, moved, to strike out the whole Section— He and Payne of Alabama, made speeches, against the whole system of Marine Hospitals as appendages to that of internal improvement. Howell Cobb of Georgia, carried a motion for the Committee to rise, and then the resolution to close the debate in Committee of the whole, at one o clock, P.M. tomorrow— After which and some struggling the House adjourned— "

Mumford—a native of Mecklinburg County, Virginia born on the 15th. August 1775. and deceased at Richmond 21st. June 1825. How a man could have the courage, to write a translation in English blank verse after the rhymes of Pope, and the two translations of Cowper, I find it difficult to imagine; but I agreed to take a copy of the work, for the curiosity of the case, and for the benefit of Mr. Mumfords widow, by whom it is published twenty years after his death— Mr Schenck Chairman of the Committee of Investigation in the case of Charles. J. Ingersoll, but into my hands four interrogatories, in writing, on the part of that Committee requesting me to answer them, at my convenience— At the House Haralson Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs moved a call upon the President for all the Official Despatches from General Taylor, relating to the Battles of the 8th. and 9th. instt., which was adopted— Committee of the whole on the State of the Union George W. Hopkins in the Chair, on the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Bill— A debate followed and Jacob Collamer of Vermont in a calm, argumentative and efficient speech, replied to the Anti-Tariff invective, yesterday pronounced, by W. W. Payne, of Alabama— He was followed by Andrew Stuart of Pennsylvania, who spoke till the time came for closing the debate— His Speech was as usual, highly animated and forcebal? in favor of Protective Policy Payne, by a low cunning common to all the Southern Anti-Tariffites affects to charge the Tariff as exclusively favorable to the interest of New England—but Stuart is a Pennsylvanian and Pensylvania has a far deeper interest in the Tariff Policy than New England— The debate being arrested, the voting commenced and sundry amendments were adopted— The item for the Marine Hospitals was struck out and two attempts, partially to re-insert it, were rejected— An appropriation for the sixth volume, of the fourth series, of the documentary History of the United States of 25.449. dollars, offered by R. C. Winthrop by direction of the Committee of Ways and Means, was carried, by being made payable, to Blair and Rives— Winthrop moved an item of $18000. for a Commissioner to Mexico whenever the President shall ascertain that he will be received— Rejected 50. to 81. There was an item of $5000. for the Salary of a Commissioner to reside in China, to which Jacob Thompson moved a proviso, that no part of this Sum shall be paid, without a Certificate on honor from the said Commissioner that he does reside in China; which after being amended at the motion of George Rathbun to read “That the salary shall not be paid unless the Commissioner shall actually reside in China” was adopted 74 to 40. This was a kick at Alexander. H. Everett, who fourteen months ago, embarked for China, went as far as Rio de Janeiro, and returned, from thence, on account of ill-health. He has ever since been living here receiving the salary, and promising to re-embark when his health should be sufficiently restored— John. P. Martin of Kentucky and Joseph. J. McDowell of Ohio, made clap trap motions, for reducing pay and travel of Members of Congress in the midst of which small work, the message with General Taylor’s Despatches, was received from the President, referred to the Military Committee, and ordered to be printed Haralson, reported a Bill to provide certain military tactics for the use of volunteers twice read and Committed— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, again on the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Bill— More motions for bunkum, to reduce the pay and the mileage and to forfeit pay, for non-attendance—the most senseless of which were carried— Yell of Arkansas moved an additional section to the Bill to remove the seat of Government in 1850, to St Louis Missouri which the Chairman ruled, not to be in order— Bell of Kentucky, Stephen Adams of Mississippi and Bowlin of Missouri, moved sundry other retrenchment nonsense, till the quorum entirely failed, the Committee rose and the House adjourned— In the evening I attended at a large Party, given by Mr. Joseph. R. Ingersoll, at the House of Mr. Markoe given to Mr. Christopher Hughes, and his daughter, and a company of friends from Baltimore— The weather was excessively warm, and I was much indisposed, so that after being there a short hour, I was compelled to come home, before Mr. Hughes came in— "

                "text": "28. IV—  Mr. Chamberlain came again this morning, and brought me the two volumes of Mumfords Illiad for which I paid him five dollars and fifty cents I had received a Letter from D. G. Ingraham of Boston, asking for a copy of my correspondence, with the late William Tudor junior in May 1822, relating to the purchase, of his father’s Journals, for the Library of the Department of state.— These Journals, contain the most authentic account of the discovery of the Columbia River, by Capt. Robert Gray— I called at the Department of State this morning, and made enquiry of the Secretary Mr. Buchanan, concerning that correspondence, which was immediately found and of which he promised me a copy— I had also a conversation with him relating to the usages of the Department with regard, to allowing access to Members of Congress, to the secret Archives, of the Department. I found the practise had continued as it was during my time, but Mr. Buchanan expressed an opinion with which I concurred that it had now become necessary to establish some restriction upon the unlimited access, of Members of Congress, to all the secret papers of the Department— The recent abuse of that privilege, by Charles. J. Ingersoll, has shown that some such restriction will be indispensable, in future— At the House, Stephens of Georgia, offered a resolution for printing four thousand copies of the map of Texas, compiled by Lieut Emory— Rhett of South Carolina objected, saying he had heard, that the map was not correct— Stephens, moved, to suspend the rules, but the House refused— The Bill from the Senate for establishing Post routes and the mail service, in Texas, was reported by Hopkins from the Post Office Committee, with an Amendment, which was adopted, and the Bill was passed, and sent back to the Senate— Committee of the whole on the State of the Union Hopkins in the Chair on the Civil and Diplomatic appropriation bill. An Amendment to diminish the pay of the Officers of Government and the members of Congress and to increase that of volunteers, to ten dollars a month—was rejected, and the Bill reported to the House, with Amendments— Several of the Amendments were adopted, among which that relating to the mileage of Members of Congress. The appropriation for the Meteorologist was struck out by yeas and nays, 92 to 77. and the Bill was passed and sent to the Senate— Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, the resolution of thanks to General Taylor, and his troops were taken up.— James. A. Black of South Carolina, offered an additional resolution for pensioning, the wounded Officers and Soldiers and the widows and children of the killed; which was opposed by Burt of the same state as fixing upon the Country, a gigantic Pension system— The debate slided into a contest upon merits and demerits, of the West Point Academy Ashmun, objected to one of the resolutions containing an appropriation, as un-Constitutional Brinkerhoff appealed to a precedent, in which, there was no appropriation— I referred as I have done, many times before, to the express terms, of the Constitution, to show that no appropriation, of money, can be made, by resolution— Brodhead appealed to the precedent at this Session in the resolution for the admission of Texas; which I said was only one additional violation of the Constitution The Chairman, decided that no appropriation could be made by resolution. Charles J. Ingersoll said that Chief Justice Marshall had expressly decided that a joint resolution was to all intents and purposes, a Law. Boyd the Chairman said that his decision was otherwise, Chief Justice Marshall to the contrary notwithstanding— But Ingersolls assertion was not true— Brinkerhoff appealed from the decision of the Chair Black of South Carolina had done so already— Sawyer of Ohio and Jefferson Davis of Mississippi snarled about the West-point Academy— Luther Severance, made a speech in justification of his vote against the Declaration of War, to which Barkly Martin of Tennessee replied with usual slave-monger brutality— Giddings took the floor Hudson that the Committee rise; carried 89 to 34.— In the House Bayly offered a resolution the previous Question was called but Joseph J McDowell of Ohio, said he hoped, the gag would not be resorted to in this case. McKay offered a simple resolution of thanks, which after some slight Amendment was adopted unanimously and the House adjourned— Christopher Hughes, Robert C. Winthrop George Ashmun and William. A. Moseley dined with us— The weather oppressively warm "

Mr. Kavasales was here this morning, but I could give him no cheering intelligence, and had not seen the Secretary of the Navy, since he was here last— I received from the Secretary of State, a Letter with copies of my correspondence, with William Tudor junior in May 1822. relating to the manuscripts, of Mr. Ingraham— Mr. Buchanan says, that the four volumes, of the Journals, received from Mr. Ingraham’s widow at Boston are now in the Library of the Department, and that it does not appear, that the four volumes, said to have been left in France have ever been recovered— In the House yesterday, there were, three resolutions passed, one of thanks to General Taylor, his Officers, and men, one of sympathy with the relatives and friends, and one requesting the President to communicate the others to General Taylor and through him to the Army under his command— The three were passed, by one unanimous vote, without call, for yeas, and nays— This morning Armistead Burt offered a joint resolution, for the appointment of a select Committee to consist of three Members of the House, and two of the Senate—to attend the Annual examination of Cadets of the Military Academy at West point on the first of June next, and that the Committee be specially charged, to inquire fully and minutely into the condition of the Institution, all abuses if any, and the propriety of reducing, abolishing, or supporting and sustaining the same, and report to Congress at the present Session— After a short debate, and a motion to lay the resolution on the Table rejected 70 to 105, resolution was adopted 91. to 82, and sent to the Senate— I had not reached the House when this vote was taken— The Private callendar was taken up.— The House refused to reconsider the vote rejecting a Bill to authorize the issuing of a Patent to Charles. G. Page, and Examiner in that Office.— A motion to reconsider the vote rejecting the allowance of the fishing bounty, in the Schooner Florilla, lost at Sea, was again lost, by a tie vote 85 to 85. Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hannibal Hamlin in the Chair, on the Bill from the Senate, supplementary, to the Declaration of War against Mexico, but at the motion of George Rathbun, was laid aside to wait for the printing of the Bill— Then a Bill was taken up from the Senate making alterations in the Pay Department in the Army.— Upon which a Cong debate ensued, till the committee rose and Haralson moved a resolution to close the debate in committee in half an hour after taking it up again, but the House adjourned without taking the Question, on the motion— I was so much oppressed by the heat of the weather that I was obliged to leave the Table at dinner and Dr. Thomas was called in by my wife— I was confined at home the rest of the day— My complaints are occasioned by the premature heat of the weather and some carelessness of diet, chiefly from eating Strawberries— "

Chapman—who called at the House to receive them— At the House, the resolution for closing debate, on the Bill making alterations in the Pay Department of the Army, in half an hour was taken up, and modified, to allow two hours, and then was adopted— Lynn Boyd, offered a resolution for the House to meet hereafter, daily, at 10. o’clock A.M. and take a recess from two to half past three P.M. The vote was 71. to 60. not sufficient to suspend the rules, but a majority, which in a few days, will carry the resolution— Some time was allowed for the consideration of Private Bills. That for the relief of Commodore Thomas Ap Catesby Jones, was passed, without taking the yeas and nays, which were refused. After disposing of two or three other private cases, the House went again into Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, and took up the Bill to regulate the Pay Department of the Army. A long debate ensued, and a manggling altercation between, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, and Jefferson Davis of Mississippi upon the comparative merits of West point pupils, and blacksmiths, and tailors for Army Officers— Washington Hunt of New York, had obtained the floor, but yielded it for an explanation, to Jefferson Davis who from that time kept a running fight with Johnson till the time for closing the debate, came and Hunt lost his chance of making a Speech— Andrew Stuart, renewed his attempt to get ten dollars a month pay for the Soldiers and volunteers, and Albert Constable of Maryland moved to strike out ten and insert twenty besides one hundred and sixty Acres of Land, which Shelton F Leake of Virginia moved should be located in Mexico After a variety of such Amendments, McKay, Chairman of the Committee of ways and means, moved to strike out the whole Bill and insert a very short one authorizing the appointment of three additional Pay Masters to serve as long as the increased number of the rank and file in the Army shall continue— This Bill was reported to the House and passed under the previous question, so expeditiously that Jacob Brinkerhoff sneerlingly inquired, if it would be in order to move that the Committee on Military Affairs should be abolished and a Legislator General appointed in its place. This was a fling at McKay Brinkerhoff being himself, a member of the Military Committee, but McKay took no notice of it— Haralson of Georgia moved to go into Committee again, upon other Bills, reported by the Military Committee but after sundry motions to adjourn and for a call of the House, the motion to adjourn was finally carried— "

V—  The weather continues oppressively warm, and my debility keeps pace with it— I attended this morning public worship in the Hall of the House of Representatives where in the place of Mr. Milburn the Chaplain of the House a stranger preached from Hebrew 4.16. [“]Let us therefore, come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help, in time of need”— Whether from listlessness, incidental to the state of my health, or from a want of sufficient energy, in the performance of the Preacher, he left not, in my mind, an impression, distinct enough, to remember, the substance, or the drift, of his Discourse, which had at least the merit of brevity. In the Afternoon, I attended at the Second Presbyterian Church where the Revd. Matthew Hale Smith, preached his farewell sermon, the text of which was, it seemed to me, quite singular, Matthew 26–65—“Then, the high Priest rent his clothes, saying, he hath spoken blasphemy, what further need have we of witnesses, behold now ye have heard his blasphemy.” Mr. Smith related the circumstances under which, this saying of the High Priest was spoken, and whereby the Assembly of the Scribes and the Elders and all the Council, pronounced sentence of death upon Jesus Christ, and the argument of his Discourse was, upon the wickedness of rash judgments, and after handling this topic very shortly, he concluded his Discourse, by taking leave of the Society his engagement, having been to supply the Pulpit for a limited time, which had expired— He mentioned, that he himself, was of the Denomination of the Congregational Church, the Society being of what are called new school Presbyterians— Mr. Smith is a very amiable man, and I regret that his connection with this Church is not of longer duration— We had evening visits from Mr. John Healey, Mr. Archibald Campbell and Isaac Hull Adams— "

The first Bill, taken up, was to aid, in the construction of certain roads, in the Territory of Wisconsin— There were a multitude of appropriations to which sundry others were added by Amendments and after several failures to vote for want of a quorum Haralson, Chairman of the Military Committee, moved to rise, to take up a Bill from the Senate, supplemental to the Act providing for the prosecution of the War against Mexico— Haralsons motion was rejected, and the Bill taken up, making appropriations, for improvements in the Territory of Iowa— As a sample of the mode of proceeding in the House McConnell of Alabama, moved an Amendment for breaking up the running gear of ruin and foul Legislation two-millions of dollars— It passed unnoticed— Sundry other Territorial Bills followed, among which, one, to direct the President of the United States to sell, the reserved mineral Lands, in the States of Illinois and Arkansas, and the Territories of Wisconsin and Iowa— I objected to using the word direct, as applied to the President— Upon which the phraseology was altered— The debate was continued till the Committee rose without coming to a conclusion, and the House adjourned— William.

Taylor several articles of the manufacture of Soap, as a present, with a very polite and obliging Letter These persons are manufacturers of that Article and among those, who are exhibiting articles, from there manufacture at the Fair in this City I answered their Letter this day and accepted their present not without reluctance, but considering it of too small, pecuniary value, to object against it, upon a principle— I was inclined to ask them to receive payment for it, but my wife shamed me out of that fancy and I merely accepted it with thanks— My principle has always been to refuse all presents offered to me as a Public Man, but where the value is very small I thought it would be ridiculous to make a point upon it— It has not always been easy for me to draw the line of distinction— Mr. Jefferson in a Letter to Levit Harris declared his principle to be the same, with that which I have always observed, and in conformity with it, he accepted from Harris a Plaster Bust of the Emperor Alexander, which might be worth ten dollars— At the House, Territorial business, Second day— Stephen A. Douglass, of Illinois, Chairman of the Territorial Committee moved a resolution to close the debate in Committee of the whole on the Bill for selling the reserved mineral lands, in thirty minutes after it should be taken up in Committee, which was carried and Armistead Burt, moved a resolution to close the debate at one oclock this day; on the Bill from the Senate supplementary to the Declaration of War against Mexico— Garrett Davis moved to lay the resolution on the Table; which was refused, and the resolution adopted by yeas and nays, 93. to 66.— The House went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, immediately upon that Bill— Garrett Davis made an hour Speech not so much against the Bill, as against the Executive Administration for having placed General Taylor and his Troops, in the most imminent danger without providing for him seasonable re-inforcments. Whereupon, Burt moved that the committee should rise for a resolution to extend the time of debate—which was done. The further consideration of Territorial Bills, was then postponed to next Tuesday, and the time for the debate on the supplementary War Bill was extended to two oclock P.M. tomorrow— Then the House went into committee of the whole again, on the same Bill, and Haralson, and Jacob Brinkerhoff answered as well as they could, Garrett Davis’ onset upon Mr. Polk’s Administration.— After some further debate, the committee rose, a motion to adjourn was rejected and Jacob Thompson from the Committee on Indian Affairs, reported a Bill, relating to the Cherokee Indians.— Joseph Morris of Ohio, moved an instruction, to the Judiciary Committee, to report a Bill adopting the Laws of Maryland for the government and administration of the Dist. Columbia— After some debate on which the House refused to adjourn, then refused a call of the House and then adjourned— "

D. Baker, was gone, he believed for the same purpose, but not being certain of that, he moved only to fill the place of Mr. Yell— Daniel said he had made a similar motion early in the Session, to fill the place of a Member of the Committee of Claims, but the Speaker had decided that the motion must be made by the Member himself, by requesting to be excused, from service on the Committee Some further objection was made to Haralsons motion which he withdrew— The House went into committee of the whole on Private Bills, Lynn Boyd of Kentucky in the Chair—and this being the first Friday in the month, was one of the days, the fourth Friday being another, when those Bills only, are taken up, to the passage of which, no objection is made, and fifty-five Bills, were reported to the House without objection— There were several others passed over upon objection made by a single Member— In some instances the objection, after being made, was withdrawn, Robert McClelland of Michigan made a question of order, whether after an objection made, and other Bills passed upon, the Committee could go back, to withdraw, objections made— Some two weeks ago, the Committee had sustained the decision of the Chair that this retroaction was in order. but Boyd now decided that it was not, and his decision was not appealed from— Erastus.

Mr. Kavasales was here this morning, still without assignment to any Station, as a Navy Chaplain— At the House, James. B. Bowlin of Missouri, Chairman of the Committee of Private Land Claims, reported back, two Bills from the Senate, one with and one without amendments, relating to preumptions— This Committee might be called, the Committee of Distribution, of the public Lands.— There is not one Member from New England, upon it, and only one, from New York, South of Maryland—six of the nine are from the States, where the Public Lands are situated, and the Speaker himself is from Indiana, one of them— They have a glorious propensity, to give away the Lands. The two Bills reported by Bowlin, were referred to the committee of the whole on the State of the Union— Garrett Davis of Kentucky, asked leave to introduce a resolution of enquiry of the Heads of Departments, whether their job printing stationary and binding, have been let, to the lowest bidder, according to Law— Objection was made, Davis moved a suspension of the rules, upon which the vote by yeas and nays, was 72 to 66. not two-thirds and so the enquiry was suppressed— Robert. C. Winthrop from the Committee of Ways and Means, reported a Bill, providing for the distribution of the addition of the Laws and Treat of the United States, published by Littel and Brown; which was twice read, and left on the Speakers Table. Haralson Chairman of the Military Committee, renewed the motion yesterday made to appoint a member, of that Committee in the place of Archibald Yell of Arkansas, who has left this City, not intending to return during the present Session— Jacob Brinkerhoff of Ohio said that Edward. D. Baker of Illinois another member of the same Committee, had gone off in the same way; both of them intending to raise Troops to go as Volunteers to the War against Mexico. After some discussion on the irregularity of this proceeding, Haralson moved to excuse Yell, from further service on military Committee, which was adopted— The Speaker said that he would have it so entered on the Journal, that it should not be referred to as a precedent, hereafter— Both of these members have gone away, without notice to the House, and without intending to return— This though in direct violation of a rule of the House, and a gross violation of the duty of the Member to his Constituents and to his Country, has become a very general practise, and the motive for it, is as mean, as the practise itself, is vicious— The rule is, “that no member shall absent himself, from the service of the House, without its permission, but if he asks and obtains permission his pay is suspended, during his absence”— If he goes without permission, his pay continues without suspension, and Members absent themselves for weeks, and sometimes for months, and receive pay, as if their attendance had been without interruption— Two or three private Bills, reported yesterday from the committee of the whole House, were then passed, and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, asked leave to introduce a Joint-resolution to close the Session on Monday the 20th. of July, upon objection made, he moved to suspend the rules, and the vote was 84. to 73. not two thirds— Lynn Boyd, asked leave to make a motion that the daily hour of meeting should henceforth be, ten o clock A.M. the vote on suspending the rules was 111. to 64. not two thirds, but the House agreed to meet at ten o clock next Monday morning— A few more private Bills, were acted upon, until shortly after two o clock the third or fourth motion to adjourn was finally carried— Evening visit from Mr. John Pope, who is going to join the Army in Mexico— I received from the Pension Office two pension Certificates for Sarah.

John 5.7—“For there are three, that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost. and these three are one.” The Sermon was of not more than ten minutes length, and the Preacher without scruple, declared, his implicit faith in the doctrine of the Trinity— He said, that there was no more, of reason, or argument, against it, than there was against the Omnipotence, and Omnipresence, of God— This is not, the most ingenious expedient, of escaping from the question, and I felt some compassion, for Mr. Pyne, in the necessity under which he found himself, to confess his faith, on the authority of a text universally admitted by all candid Biblical critics to be spurious— He made a lame attempt to explain the meaning, of the three in one, but left it, in all its inexplicable darkness— We had no visitors this evening— "

I found it, in the sixth volume, of the fourth series of American Archives, published by Peter Force. And upon referring the Commissioner of Pensions, to that authority, he immediately issued the Certificates— My Son and his son, went with me, to the House.— The reading of a great part of the Journal, was dispensed with Lynn Boyd, who had been appointed, to fill the vacancy on the Military Committee in the place of Archibald Yell, claimed to be excused, as being already a member of two standing Committees, on the Territories and on Roads and Canals; he was excused, from service not on the Military Committee, but on the Committee on the Territories, and Kaufman, the new member from Texas, was appointed in his place— This Mr. Kaufman, came to my Seat, and with much politeness, which I returned in kind, introduced himself to me The Territorial business, being the special order for the day, was taken up, in committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Robert McClelland of Michigan in the Chair, and a Bill to grant Lands, for the improvement of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers, being laid aside, a Bill to define the boundaries, of the state of Iowa, and to repeal the boundaries, described in the Act of 3d. March 1845— was taken up, and very earnestly debated by Julius Rockwell, Stephen. A. Douglass—George Rathbun, Augustus. C. Dodge the Delegate from Iowa, Samuel F. Vinton, and James. B. Bowlin— Then came a Bill, to enable the people of the Territory of Wisconsin, to form a Constitution and State Government, and for the admission of the State, into the Union— Upon which a question arose, whether it was competent for Congress—to divide the Territory of Wisconsin, so as to form from it more than one State— The ordinance for the North Western Territory had prescribed that that in process of time it should be divided into States, not less than three, nor more than five In fulfilment of this stipulation the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan have already been formed, and admitted into the Union. The Territory of Wisconsin constitutes the remainder of the North Western Territory— They are all, large States, embracing, from 50. to 65,000. square miles, each— The Territory of Wisconsin is much larger still, and it becomes a question whether the whole of it must be included in the new State—this was not however finally decided— The Bill with some others was reported to the House, after which they adjourned to ten oclock tomorrow morning— This evening, we all went to see R Winters Illuminated Chemical Dioramas, in the style of Daguerre—being successive exhibitions of the Milan Cathedral, Belshazzar’s Feast—The destruction of Babylon, with a view of the Tower of Babel, and the Funeral and Tomb of Napoleon—at the Hospital of Invalids at Paris.

The report was, that there was no ground for impeaching Mr. Webster, and it concluded with two resolutions, one that the testimony, should be sealed up, by the Clerk under the supervision of the Committee, endorsed confidential, and deposited in the Archives of the House, not to be opened, unless by its order, the other, that the report be laid on the Table and printed, and the Committee discharged, from the further consideration of the subject— The report was signed, Samuel F Vinton, Jefferson Davis—Daniel.

Smith, to Mr. Webster, which was part of the testimony to be sealed up, and kept secret, according to the resolution, reported by the majority of the Committee— Upon this a somewhat testy debate, arose, which finally closed by a motion, to lay both reports on the Table, with an order that both should be printed— Inquiry was made, whether Ingersoll had been before the Committee, Brinkerhoff said he had not and Vinton said that he had not requested to appear before them— Garrett Davis asked leave to make a report, from the select Committee on public printing; but it was refused 72. to 99. The remainder of the day, was occupied in the discussion, of sundry Territorial Bills, and Bills from the Senate, also, on a report, of Samuel Gordon, from Select Committee on the purchase—and distribution of the tenth volume of the Laws—till at last, George. S. Hopkins, moved a resolution requiring the Sergeant-At-Arms Lane, to re-instate, a messenger named Wm. T. Stuart, whom he had displaced, without any sufficient cause, known to the House. This resolution after a hot debate, was adopted by yeas and nays 75 to 46, but John Henley of Indiana, immediately moved a reconsideration of that vote, and then the adjournment of the House, which was carried— We had a small company to dinner as named in the margin, besides whom Erastus. D. Culver, of the fourteenth Congressional District of New York, had been invited; and promised to come, but sent by Mr. Hudson an excuse, being detained by a visit from one of his Constituents— In the evening we had visits from Mr. Theodore Lyman Moody, and Isaac Hull Adams— My wife went to hear the Harmoneans this evening.

They left the City in a train of Cars for Baltimore at 1/2 past twelve at noon, expecting to reach Philadelphia, this evening— At the House, Timothy Pillsbury, appeared, as the second Representative from the new State of Texas, and took his Seat—as a member of the House. Seaborn Jones, from the select Committee on the charges, of Charles. J. Ingersoll, against Daniel Webster, offered a Resolution for printing all the evidence, which the report, of the Committee, had recommended, should be sealed up and kept secret— But objection was made, and the resolution was not received. Thomas. J. Henley’s motion, to reconsider the vote of yesterday, ordering the re-instatement of William. T. Stuart as messenger to the Sergeant-at-Arms. was debated. and then laid on the Table, 85. to 80— John A. Rockwell of Connecticut, had yesterday moved to re-consider, the vote, passing the Bill to enable the people of Wisconsin Territory to form a Constitution and State Government, and its admission into the Union— After some debate the re-consideration was carried 125 to 45. Rockwell then moved, to reconsider the vote for the engrossment of the Bill; which was carried— He then moved to reconsider, a proviso, authorizing the State Convention, to adopt boundaries including the whole Territory— This was also carried. the proviso was struck out M. M. Martin a Delegate from the Territory then moved to lay the Bill on the Table, which was refused, the Bill was passed, without the proviso and sent to the Senate— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon Bills, relating to the District of Columbia. The Bill to regulate the appointment of certain Officers, in the Executive Departments of the Government at Washington and for the more general and equal diffusion of such Offices, among the several States, and Territories, and the District of Columbia, was taken up, and debated chiefly upon two principles, one for the distribution of the Offices, according to the representation from the States, and the other, of limiting the duration of the Offices— Ashman moved an Amendment, that the appointments should be made, without regard, to political Party, or Religious Denomination Stephen. A. Douglass of Illinois, made a Speech, somewhat peremptory against the whole Bill which he believed to be altogether impracticable and was answered in a tone equally domineering by George Rathbun of New York and William Sawyer of Ohio who told a lamentable tale of his labors, urging the President, and the Heads of Departments, to turn out, Whig Clerks from their Offices, and appoint, Democrats, and among them numbers of his Constituents, in their places— He represented them, as very clamorous, for the Offices, but he had been able scarcely to obtain appointments for any of them, and he had been obliged, to put his hands in his pocket, and furnish them with money, to go home, after they had been waiting here, two, four, or even six months, in expectation of receiving Offices, and with final disappointment— He said he held, to the doctrine that “to the victors belong the spoils” but complained, that all the Offices, were absorbed—by the States of Virginia and Maryland, and the District of Columbia— Dromgoole, reminded him, that “if the spoils belong to the victors” the State of Ohio, not having voted for the Democratic President, could have no claim, to a share of them. Sawyer replied, by boasting, of his own exertions, in the cause of the Democracy, and said that Ohio, had given more votes, for the Democratic President, than Virginia. The committee rose. Jacob Collamer, reported from the Committee on Public Lands, a Bill further to extend the time, for locating, Virginia Military Land warrants, which Bill was passed without opposition— George. S. Houston of Alabama, introduced a joint-resolution, to institute a Board of Commissioners to ascertain the Amount of Claims, of citizens of the United States against Mexico Referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.— Jefferson Davis of Mississippi presented a remonstrance, from sundry Ladies of New York against a passage in the report of the Committee on the Militia, in the House, made on the 9th. of January 1846—reflecting upon the superannuated soldiers of the Army. Remonstrance was read and after a short discussion laid on the Table and the House adjourned. Evening visit, from Mr. Washington Hunt, Member of the House from the 34th.

Pierce Cranch the latter of whom was Elizabeth De Windt, are here upon a visit to his Father. I went over to his house, and took up Mrs. Cranch, who came home with me, and they dined with us., and spent the day— Their usual residence now, is at New York, and I believe he has abandoned his profession as a preacher and taken up that of a painter— They propose to visit Italy in the course of the Summer— In the afternoon, at Saint John’s Church, Mr. Pyne read the evening Service, for the first Sunday after Trinity, and preached, from 1. Corinthians 7.31. the latter clause of the verse, “For the fashion of this world passeth away.” At the 2nd. Presbyterian Church, now destitute of a Pastor a Mr. Craighead from Pennsylvania preached morning and Evening— I did not hear him, but attended at the Church at four oclock in the afternoon the usual time of the service there, but retired on observing that the Communion was about to be administered— The preacher had not arrived This Church is once more a flock without a shepherd.

[“]For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own Soul, or what shall a man give in exchange for his Soul.” In his prayer, he adverted, to the recent decease of a member of the House, and his Sermon, appeared to be adapted to that occasion, though the selection of the text, did not seem to me, to be very kindly, selected, for it— I did not know while he spoke who the member was, to whose death he alluded. After the Sermon, I inquired of Mr. Severance, who sat near me, and he said it was Richard. P. Herrick, Member from the 12th. Congressional District of New York— I had seen him in his Seat, not far from mine last Tuesday, and had not missed him from it, since. But he was taken ill that day, and died of billious colick last night— I walked from the Capitol home and after dinner attended at the 2nd. Presbyterian Church, where the Revd. Joshua Danforth, preached from 1. Thessalonians, 5 17. [“]Pray without ceasing.”— A close argumentative discourse upon the subject of prayer, upon which, a Christian Divine, would do well, to study the second Alcibiades of Plato, the tenth satire of Juvenal, and Dr. Johnson’s Vanity of human wishes— The sentiment first unfolded by Socrates, concerning prayer, is unfolded, forms the theme, of this moral principle, and it considers prayer, only, as its adaptation, to the happiness of man The Christian views it, with referrence, to the duties, of man, to God, to his neighbour, and to himself. Mr. Danforth’s discourse, was logical, and impressive, with a hardness of piety, charachteristic of him— There was no service at St John’s Church this afternoon Mr. Pyne being indisposed— Walter Hellen left us this day, and went to attend on his mother, who is very sick— There was a very sudden change of weather last night, from heat to cold. My wife and Mrs. John Adams, are this day both ill confined to their beds.— Dr. Thomas was here and prescribed for me, as well as for them— Lieut Thom, and Isaac Hull Adams were also here this afternoon— "

Mr. Baker, to remain unmoved, by his eloquence after resisting that, of the Bishop of Clermont— Mr. Baker is sincere, in his belief, and so might perhaps be, the amiable, and most ingenious, French Bishop, whose Sermons, are among the most, admirable and persuasive, that I have ever read. The creed is beyond the reach, of my understanding— At the House, George Ashmun, moved a suspension of the rules, for a resolution, directing the Secretary of War, to settle and adjust by arbitration the dispute between the United States and David Ames of Springfield, about Water power in Mill river—motion lost— Bill from the Senate to organize a volunteer force, and for the appointment of their Officers— Haralson, Chairman of the Military Committee moved to put the Bill on its passage, without referrence to any Committee but the Bill, gives the appointment of the Officers, to the President of the United States and Amendments were instantly started for their appointment according to the State Laws or by the volunteers themselves A debate ensued; the previous question was twice moved and failed; the third time it succeeded, and the Bill passed as it came from the Senate— Committee of the whole on the State of the Union Cobb Chairman— Tariff Bill— Winthrop closed his Speech yesterday by offering five propositions against the repeal of the Tariff and for an emission of 8. or 10. millions of Treasury notes— To-day Lucien B.

At the House, McKay moved that the Clerk of the House B. B. French, have leave of absence next week, not to exceed four days which was granted— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Cobb Chairman— Tariff Bill— Henry Bedinger 10th. Congressional District of Virginia, made his hour Speech, in favor of the new Bill, followed by Edward H. Ewing 8th. Tennessee the Nashville District against it.— Then James Polluck, 13th. Pennsylvania, made a very warm hour speech, for the protective system generally, and noticed the representations made, in Pennsylvania; during the last Presidential canvass to persuade the People of that State, that James K. Polk was a better Tariff man, than Henry Clay—and he specially charged the present secretary of State Buchanan, with having practised that deception, in Speeches to the people— This occasioned some stir among the Democracy, but was in nowise surprising to me— Towns of Georgia succeeded Mr. Pollock, and was followed by Luther Severance of Maine— Tibbatts took the floor, moved the committee to rise— Sundry motions for a recess and call of the House, the third or fourth motion to adjourn succeeded 50. to 48. We have not received a line from my Son, since he left us on the 10th. of this month and we have been full ten days on tenter hooks, for fear, of we knew not what, but that some great misfortune had befallen him, or his family. I wrote him a Letter yesterday telling him of the agony we were in, but Isaac Hull Adams told us this afternoon that he had received yesterday a Letter from his Sister, who had returned from New York to Quincy and said she had gone out in the Cars from Boston with Charles and his Son, and the family were all well.

IV.30—  In the Hall of the House of Representatives this morning Mr. Tustin the Chaplain of the Senate preached to almost empty benches his text is John 5.40. “And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life”— It was not altogether easy to refrain from a smile upon hearing this text and seeing not one third of the seats of the Members of the House occupied— Mr. Tustin however was in nowise disconcerted at the prospect, but delivered a discourse not according to the severe doctrine, of the Old Presbyterian School, which allows, no free will to man no capacity to work out his own salvation but on the contrary urging earnestly from the text, that it implied, the power of exercising the will, in every individual, by making it a charge upon his Auditory that they would not exercise it— A charge which could of course, have no application to them, if they were denied the power. Mr. Tustin has one advantage, in performing the Religious Services, in the Hall of the House on Sundays, he can set the time, for singing the Hymn, and can sing himself, even if he has no hearer to join in making melody. Other preachers in that place, frequently have not the same power and the singing is entirely omitted— Mr. Tustin gives out two lines at a time, and then sets the time, usually followed by a few of the hearers. After dinner at the 2d. Presbyterian Church, Mr. Charles H. Nourse, a Licentiate of the Presbytery of this District, preached, from Luke 12.8. “Also I say unto you, whosoever shall confess me, before men, him shall the Son of man also confess, before the Angels of God.” 9. “But he, that denieth me before men, shall be denied before the Angels of God”— Mr. Nourse is not a young man nor was there any thing very remarkable in his discourse.

He encloses also Cards of the House and of J. P. Robinson He says they have received great encouragement, from several of the first Gentlemen, of the State and are using their endeavours for the extension of their business in this Country, and have for that purpose established several Agencies in the different principal Cities— I answered an invitation from E. B. Edwards Chairman of a committee of Whig Citizens of the County of Philadelphia, to a public Dinner on the Anniversary day next Saturday, declining as I had done to the invitation from the Whigs of the City of Philadelphia— At the House the debate on the Tariff Bill in committee of the whole on the state of the Union, again absorbed the day— James Thompson 23. Pennsylvania, finished his reply to Yancey whose excommunication from the Democracy he resented with much worthy indignation— R. M. T. Hunter 8. Virginia, hammered out, a common place, invective against protection and the tariff of 1842. R. Toombs. 8. Georgia made a pleasant, protection, tariff Speech. W. W. Wick of Indiana, a Speech on the other side. He said he was called by his Constituents, Billy Wick, and had once been a bit of a Federalist himself and was as honest then as he is, now which I readily believe: but now he was better informed. Charles H Carroll, 29. New York, supported the tariff of 1842. and opposed the Bill— But David Wilmot 12. Pennsylvania, delivered a vehement Anti-tariff invective; immediately succeeded by Felix G. McConnell 1. Alabama to the same time “par nobile fratrum”— I left him speaking, and went and dined with Mr. Winthrop, Mr. & Mrs. Grinnell and the party at Mrs. Whitwells— It was passed six when I returned to the House where I found, Daniel M.

But I perseveringly declined having no feeling for festivity to-morrow. In the House this whole day was consumed in voting upon Amendments, to the Tariff Bill, first in committee of the whole on the state of the Union, by Tellers, and after the Bill was reported with Amendments to the House, by yeas and nays— The struggle to strike out 20. per cent duty, on Tea and Coffee, was successful that to make salt free succeeded in Committee, but finally failed in the House; the fishing bounties, and drawback on Salt, used in the Fisheries were carried in committee and restored in the House— The duty of 20. per cent on salt, was carried by the casting vote of the speaker, but there was a mistake of the Clerk, in counting the votes, and the speaker’s vote was nullified but a re consideration was carried, and the duty of 20. per cent made, a fixed fact all amendments proposing specific for ad valorem duties, were rejected— The new Bill levies 100 per cent upon spirituous liquors increased from 75. reported in the Bill of the Committee. Then came classes of Articles with forty, thirty, twenty, fifteen, ten, and five per cent— The Bill was finally passed by a vote of 114 to 95. All the democracy whipped in Tibbatts moved the reconsideration to clinch the Bill and the democracy sing “io triumphe.” Adjourned at six oclock P.M. over to Monday— Incessant showers throughout the day.

The Constitution of the United States is waste paper, and the District of Columbia was a delusion. The link of continuity to the Chain of this Union is shivered to atoms, and the next step will be the removal, of the Seat of Government to a Slave State— Notwithstanding the South Carolina slave monger John.

Of Mr Milburn the Chaplain of the House, no account was given. I attended Church this morning at St John’s with my Grandaughter Mary Louisa— My wife and Mrs. John Adams, were not well; unable to attend— Mr. Pyne read the Service for the fifth Sunday after Trinity, and preached, from Psalm. 38.18. last clause of the verse, “I will be sorry for my Sin”— At five in the afternoon I attended again at the same Church, alone.

IV  I rose this morning with the dawn, and drawn by an irresistible impulse walked over the lower Tiber bridge, to my old bathing spot, on the margin of the Potomac—and there, under the shelter of the high bluff yet remaining, I bathed and swam, from five to ten minutes, came out, dressed myself, and walked home. As I went down the Hill, to the edge of the water, I found three young men, neither of whom I knew, already in the river, and heard one of them say, there is John Quincy Adams— They had their clothes, at one of my old standard rocks, but without noticing or disturbing them, I found another rock, a few rods higher, towards the Potomac bridge, where I left my clothes. The tide was low, and the time not convenient, for entering the river, but I succeeded, in obtaining the bath, for which I panted— The time consumed, was as in former days, about one hour and a half—half an hour going to the river, 1/2 and hour to bath, swim, and dress, and half an hour to return— The Thermometer was at 84. the water warm, the atmosphere calm, and the Sun clear— The exercise, washing, the sensation of personal cleanliness, were as of old, but the nervous agitation throughout the day, was not sensibly relieved and the weariness of the evening, threatened a restless night— Francis Richmond, was here, with Thomas. L. McKennie Memoirs—about Indians. 2. Octavo Volumes, in one, of which I took a Copy— And Father Green, with papers of W. Roberts, which he wished me to deliver, to Preston King, Chairman of the Committee on Invalid Pensions—which I did— At the House, Hugh. A White 16. New York, moved for a Select Committee of five, to examine the accounts, of the 5th. Auditor Pleasonton, but the House refused, to suspend the rules, to receive his motion.— George— C— Dromgoole, of 2d. Congressional District Virginia moved a message to the Senate; to remind them, of four Bills, passed by the House and sent to them, and to recommend their action upon them— A very unusual Message, not without example, in both Houses of the British Parliament, once, practised by the Senate of the United States, to the House, much to their indignation— The vote to suspend the rules, for Dromgoole was 39. to 72. Among the Bills of which he wished to remind the Senate, was that commonly called the River and Harbour Bill. One or two of Dromgoole, Party associates, enquired why, he had omitted that, from his memento— He said he had included four Bills, and that he thought sufficient— Several Bills from the Senate were passed or referred to Committees Harralson, reported a Bill, for granting Lands to the Soldiers. Numerous other reports from Committees were received. Sawyer moved to suspend the rules, for a call on the President for the correspondence, on the Oregon Treaty. Refused, without even allowing the yeas and nays. Land graduation Bill was taken up Call of the House—173. answered— McKay moved an amendment to the Bill and Cobb an amendment upon that. Cobbs amendment was rejected 87. to 95. and McKay’s 88. to 93. Motion to lay the Bill on the Table, 90. to 89. The Speaker voted made a tie and the motion was lost, moved again and lost 91. to 92, and again 86. to 92. Rathbun moved to adjourn which was carried 89. to 85— "

The success of these experiments, is doubtful, but my repose of the last night was not unsettled, but rather improved, by the bath, of yesterday— At the first Meeting of the House the Stern chase of re-considerations, was renewed— The Amendment moved by Cobb, and the Amendment of that moved by McKay after being both rejected, had both been re considered. The previous question on the Land graduation Bill had been ordered, and McKay had moved to reconsider that; he now withdrew this motion, and moved a Call of the House, which the Speaker pronounced not in order— Truman Smith, as a back-handed Call of the House moved to adjourn, and asked for the yeas and nays—which were 6. to 163. Schenck moved to reconsider this vote but the Speaker decided that a motion to adjourn could not be reconsidered Schenck appealed from this decision, and stood alone in his glory McKay’s Substitute for Cobbs Amendment was then adopted 96. to 86. and McKay’s Bill substituted for that of the Senate, was passed 92 to 90— Ewing of Pennsylvania, inquired of the Speaker, whether every Member, present in his Seat, was not bound to vote? The Speaker said, that by the rule of the House, he was, but that very frequently Members did abstain from voting without notice from the House. Ewing replied that his Colleague Charles. J. Ingersoll was in his Seat, but did not vote, on the passage of this Bill— A motion to reconsider was made pro forma and laid on the Table. Sundry Bills were received from the Senate, among which one for the relief of Elizabeth Widow of Alexander Hamilton— Hoge, Illinois, moved to lay it on the Table—lost 69. to 81— The Bill was referred— A Bill for the improvement of the Ohio, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas, inland Seas, a notable device of the political Mountabank John. C— Calhoun, came next— Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, moved to lay it on the Table— The Speaker said, that on the first reading of a Bill if opposed, the only question was shall the Bill be rejected—whereupon Hamlin moved that it be rejected, Rathbun moved the previous question, carried. Jacob Thompson moved a call of the House—the Speaker said it was too late, the previous question having been seconded. The main question was ordered, Tibbatts moved to adjourn and asked for the yeas and nays which were refused, and also the motion to adjourn— The question, shall the Bill be rejected, was taken by yeas and nays, 120. to 48. a majority formed by the sense, of the House that the Bill itself was a swindlers trick— McClelland of Michigan, moved a re-consideration and the previous question, the reconsideration was refused without division— The Treasury Note and loan Bill, was then taken up, in committee of the whole, on the State of the Union. Samuel Gordon Chairman, Garrett Davis offered an Amendment, and discussed the Mexican War, Tilden, Giddings Thurman, of Ohio and Douglass of Illinois racketed the lie, that the War began by the Act of Mexico— Tibbatts took the floor, and the committee rose— McKay moved a resolution, to close the debate, on the Treasury Note and loan Bill, in Committee of the whole to-morrow at noon. The House adjourned without taking, the question The decisive vote of the House, upon the Western River Bill, from the Senate, indicates some indignation, at the attempt, to appropriate monies, for Southern Rivers, to the exclusion of all others— "

The last decision was in his favour, and uncle Sam pays the piper— There was also a bill granting a small sum to Mrs Pike, widow of Zebulon Montgomery Pike, killed in an invasion of upper Canada in 1813 during the last War with Great Britain— But this was for services of exploration in 1805 and 1806 after the purchase of Louisiana. Daniel of N.C. Chairman of the Committee of Claims opposed it tooth and nail— So did Atkinson of Virginia, and Houston of Alabama, who moved to lay it on the table. But it was supported by Gordon and Culver, and passed 88 to 64— This day closed with a bill for the settlement of the accounts of John Garnett an Indian agent, which was read a third time, but on the question of its passage no quorum voted, and after an ineffectual motion for a call of the house they adjourned before one O’Clock— I went into the Senate chamber, and heard Daniel Webster speak about two hours against the bill to reduce the import duties and repeal the Tariff of 1842. The hall was crowded and he has the faculty of claiming the attention of his auditory—but his argument was dull, tedious and commonplace.

Letters, printed, all of one tenor but signed by different individuals, from Nantucket, invoking my influence in support of the bill to indemnify the sufferers by French spoliations before 1800. The appeal to my feelings is most impressive—but the day of my strength is past, and an atmosphere at 90 degrees of Fahrenheit annihilating. A Scotchman by the name of Stewart was here— A benevolent undertaker to promote the migration of his poor Countrymen to the United States, and soliciting money for himself which I declined to give— At the House the new tariff bill was received from the Senate with an amendment striking out the 9th. Section— The special order of the day, the Warehouse bill was postponed till to-morrow. Call of the house 211 answered 10 absent 4 vacancies— The question to suspend the special order and take up the Message from the Senate was carried 108 to 100. Winthrop claimed that it could be carried only by a two thirds vote— The Speaker said it was too late to raise the objection— Winthrop appealed and the appeal was laid on the table. 102 to 98. Stewart moved to lay the bill with the Senate’s amendment on the table, lost 96 to 113.— A second motion to lay the bill on the table was rejected 99 to 113—and the concurrence with the amendment of the Senate was carried 115 to 92— And thus perishes the Tariff of 1842. Carried by a majority of one John White then Speaker of the House, and now repeated by the casting vote of George M Dallas Vice President of the United States and President of the Senate— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the Post Office Bill, debated till of the 210 who had voted on the Tariff bill there was not a quorum of 113 left, and after some convulsive throes, the Committee rose, and the house adjourned.

On returning to the house at 5 O’Clock; I found the Speaker had resumed the Chair, but there was no Quorum— I moved a call of the House which was carried— At the first roll call 109 and at the second 140, when further proceedings were suspended The civil and diplomatic appropriation bill was resumed in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Hopkins chairman and debated till 10 at night when the Committee rose—the previous Question was moved—a motion by Dromgoole to adjourn was lost and the same motion immediately after by Hamlin was carried— I went and took up the Ladies, at the lodgings of Mr and Mrs Stockton where they had spent the Evening.

August 1809—I sailed from Charlestown for St. Petersbourg with my wife, and child Charles F. and others— The next day 6. August 1809 was the ninth Sunday after Trinity and I read to my wife on board ship the service of that day, with an impression which is not effaced— And all the while we were in Europe we continued the practice— Mr Pyne’s discourse was upon saving Faith—a perplexing subject— At 4 this afternoon I attended at the second Presbyterian church, where the Revd. Mr Patten of the Columbian College, preached from Philippians 4.6 [“]Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.”— The Sermon was upon prayer—supplication with thanksgiving— Mr Patten made no remarks upon the injunction to be careful for nothing—which deserves and perhaps requires a qualifying commentary— The spirit of the gospel is frequently monitory against the excess of worldly cares but it is only the excess that is forbidden, to which the more selfish morality of Solomon might lead— To be careful for nothing is a hyperbole a figure of speech often used by Jesus— We had evening visits from Mr Moseley to take leave from Mr M’Rea and Lieutenant Thom.

The adjournment was fixed at Noon for the convenience of members many of whom departed in the Railway Cars for Baltimore at that hour— The day like all the last days of a Session of Congress was a Chaos of confusion— It began by a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Howell Cobb chairman upon an amendment of the Senate to the Navy appropriation Bill— There was a large majority to disagree to the Senates amendment but no quorum voting— Cobb declared the disagreement carried though Garrett Davis had called for a division and remonstrated that there was no quorum. Cobb rode rough shod over Garrett Davis, and was sustained in his false report, by the Speaker John W Davis who in mockery of Garrett Davis’s remonstrance said he could receive nothing as done in Committee but the Report of the Chairman— He put the question of concurring with the amendment of the Senate which was rejected 84 to 48— The Bill afterwards passed, by a report from a Committee of Conference, so did the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill— A joint Committee was appointed to inform P.U.S. that the two houses would adjourn at Noon but they made no report— Sims of S.C. and W. W. Campbell of New York moved to take up the bill for the relief of Elizabeth Hamilton—but failed— As the hand of the Clock was on the line of 12. the Speaker declared the house adjourned to the first Monday in December. At that moment John Davis was prosing in the Senate about, the two Million Peace bill with David Wilmot’s anti-slavery for proviso—which thereby fell through G.

Rockwell to Norwich their residence where they took leave of us— Cool rain from Norwich to Worcester— Then through Framingham Natick, Newton, Brighton to Boston where just before 6. P.M. we alighted at the United States Hotel immediately opposite the Railroad depot— Tea at the United State Hotel 2.50. At 1/4 past 7. The train of Cars of the Old Colony Railroad start— My Son was at the Depot to meet us, with his Son John Quincy— Both of them came out with us— As did Ex-President of Harvard University Josiah Quincy—and Captain Dimmock, a new resident of the town— The Stations where the Cars stop are at Savin Hill, Dorchester, Neponset and Quincy, each of which was announced by the conductor as the train reached the station— At the Depot at Quincy, there was a considerable assemblage of persons, to whom as we alighted Captain Dimmock announced with a loud voice the arrival home of John Quincy Adams Representative in Congress of the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts, whereupon there was a shout of three cheers. I apologized for not returning thanks in a speech, by the extinction of my voice— Our Carriage took us from the depot home, where we found my Son’s wife with her two sons Charles and Henry to receive us— Margaret the waiting maid had reached here before us, with Mrs Goods and her daughter Jane— John Kirk and his wife Elizabeth were also here and welcomed us home.

Fahrenheit 65 at Sunrise  How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the Nations  Isaiah 14.12.  This Lucifer son of the morning is the dogstar, Sirius. I rose this morning before him, but saw him, about three quarters of an hour high, and then from the eastern corner of Charles’s house I saw the Sun rise at 5.  The Lucifer of this passage of Isaiah denotes also the king of Babylon—but whether Nebuchadnezzar or Belshazzar, is not apparent.  In the 7th chapter of this book of Isaiah is a distinct prophesy that within three-score and five years, Ephraim shall be broken, that it be not a people— Ephraim is the kingdom of Israel—the ten tribes, and the prophet foretells the Assyrian captivity.— The Lord commands Ahaz king of Judah to ask a sign to prove that the confederacy of Ephraim and Syria shall not prevail against Judah— Ahaz refuses to ask a sign, or to tempt the Lord. Whereupon the Lord says he will himself give a sign—and what is the sign?— [“]Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” and in the subsequent verses the destruction of both the kingdoms of Israel and of Judah is predicted to happen before this child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good— The whole prophesy relates to the wars and alliances of the kingdoms of Judah, Israel and Syria in the days of Ahaz—742 years before the birth of Christ— But in the first chapter of Matthew v. 18–23. it is said that the angel of the Lord appearing to Joseph in a dream, announced to him that Mary was with child by the holy Ghost, and the evangelist says all this was done, that this prophesy of Isaiah might be fulfilled. A prophesy to Ahaz king of Judah, announcing the failure of an actual confederacy of Israel and Syria, against Judah, but predicting the impending destruction of both the Jewish kingdoms, is the casket in which is enchased, the birth 700 years after of the Saviour of the world, begotten by the holy ghost upon a woman and son of God the father, from whom and from the son, the same holy ghost is said in the Athanasian creed to proceed— It were an exercise perhaps more curious than profitable to collate all the passages in the old testament which are quoted in the new as prophesies fulfilled by the advent of Jesus Christ— I received a Letter from Nathaniel Frye at Washington 28 August with a Bill of lading for four boxes, one chest and one leather trunk, shipped at Georgetown in the Schooner Forest king, Kelley Master for me. The day slipped away, and left no rembrance behind— I walked up the hill at the approach of Sunset, and rode with Mrs Charles down to the Mount Wollaston House to meet and take home my Son, and his Sons Charles and Henry returning from bathing at the beach— And Charles and his wife spent an Evening hour here— Mary Louisa went to Boston for a riding school lesson.

Isaiah 17.12.  At the meeting of the Supervisors of the Adams temple, and school fund on the 16th. of last October, it had been voted, that there should be a yearly meeting of the board on the first Monday of September, at 11. O’Clock A.M. at the chamber of the selectmen in the new Granite town Hall. There had usually been a meeting once a year since the decease of my father at my house, but it had not been specially prescribed, and in 1844 had from inadvertence been omitted— The permission of the Selectmen for the use of their chamber had been obtained and the Meeting was held this day. All the members of the board present— Thomas Greenleaf President, Josiah Quincy, George W. Beale, my Son, Charles Francis Adams, and myself. Mr Greenleaf presented the report of the Committee to examine the accounts of the Treasurer John Briesler also Treasurer of the town, which was accepted and ordered to be recorded— Mr Greenleaf communicated also a paper signed by William B. Duggan, Harvey Field, and sundry others addressed to the Selectmen requesting them to call a town meeting to see if the town will take any measures for carrying into execution my father’s purpose of establishing a classical school in this place— One of the Selectmen had put this paper into the hands of Mr Greenleaf as an advisement to the Supervisors— I thought it should be entered on the minutes and a vote should be taken to notify the Selectmen that the Supervisors had no objection to the call of a town meeting, but had no wish for it and were specially desirous, not to encumber the town with any charge whatever, on account of this trust— But my Son and the other members of the board thought that no notice of the paper should be taken of the paper on the minutes, but that it should be returned by Mr Greenleaf to the Selectmen, with a verbal assurance that the Supervisors have no objection to the town meeting, but will take no part in calling it— Mr Greenleaf, alledging his age and infirmities, invited the Supervisors to elect another President, and expressed a wish that I might be chosen, but I pleaded the same disabilities, in at least equal degree—and requested that the consideration of Mr Greenleaf’s proposal should be postponed till the next annual meeting, which was formally moved by Mr Quincy and unanimously voted— About one O’Clock the meeting was dissolved, and I walked home— Mr Greenleaf, Mr Quincy and Mr Beale dined with us together with Mr Lunt, Dr. Woodward and my Son. His wife would not come. I walked up the hill about Sunset, but the Orb buried himself in haze. "

Isaiah 35.1.  And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away 35.10.  Bishop Lowth and subsequent commentators consider the 34th. and 35th. chapters of Isaiah as a distinct prophesy, and a complete and beautiful poem apart from the rest of the book— They are immediately followed by the narrative of the invasion of the kingdom of Judah by Sennacherib, King of Assyria— Pope has made great use of this 35th. chapter of Isaiah in his Messiah.  Mr Lunt preached this morning from 1. John 3.2. [“]Beloved, now are we the Sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for we shall see him as he is— 3. And every man, that hath in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.”— We are the sons of God? how then is Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God? He declared himself times without number to be the Son of God, and spoke of God always as my father— But he taught all his disciples to address God, in prayer as our father, and he habitually called himself the Son of Man— He was born of a woman, born under the Law, according to the narrative of the Evangelists nine months after the miraculous conception, and in the same manner as other children are born— But God is a Spirit, and it is in a spiritual sense only that God is the father of Jesus Christ, though not in the same sense that he is the father of all mankind— Jesus Christ suffered crucifixion, for declaring himself to be son of God and sent on a mission to mankind by his father and Christians have involved themselves in confusion? inextricable by making Jesus himself a God. The whole doctrine of Trinity in Unity, and of the God Man Jesus Christ is a mass of absurdities as revolting to my intellect as the whole fabulous Pantheon of the Grecian Mythology. The apostle in Mr Lunts text of this morning admits that it doth not yet appear what we shall be— The state of the human soul after death is yet a mystery— It was so to St. John after the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus— It was equally so to St. Paul whose description of the Judgment day and his distinction between the corruptible, and incorruptible body, leaves us precisely where we were— In the afternoon Mr Lunt preached from 1 Corinthians 15.15. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ; whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not? The subject was a sequel to that of the morning discourse. Mr Lunt observed that the resurrection of Jesus Christ was the most important of all the tests of the truth of the Christian Religion and he delivered an elaborate argument in support of the Resurrection, by adducing sundry analogies in the successive changes in physical nature by alternations of life and death, in the mutations of corporeal substances— This was the hottest day of the Season; the Sun poured forth one continuous blaze throughout the day— I saw him set from the Northern porch of my Son’s house at 6.21— He and his wife were afterwards here.

Isaiah 40.1.— The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 4. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain 5. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”  This is the transcendent prophesy of the mission of John the Baptist, and of the Advent of the Saviour, and as such expressly recognized by all the four evangelists. It is difficult to imagine, and much more to believe the connection between the prophesy and its fulfilment— At the time when the prophet wrote the kingdom of Israel had been conquered by the king of Assyria Tilgath Pileser, and the ten tribes dispersed no one knows where— Sennacherib second successor of Tilgath Pileser was then invading Judea and besieging Jerusalem. This invasion failed, but the prophet even then foretold the approaching destruction of the kingdom of Judah and the Babylonian captivity— So little apparent connection is there between the historical condition of the kingdom of Judah at that period, and the advent and personal biography of Jesus Christ that it requires a profound investigation of Chronology to bring the two periods into any relation with each other— The old testament closes with the extinction of the kingdom of Judah—with an interval of 70 years and a restoration of the Jews to the city of Jerusalem, and the rebuilding the temple under the direction of Ezra and Nehemiah— The next step brings us per saltum, to the birth of Jesus Christ at Bethelem in Judea, a Roman Province under the dominion of Augustus Caesar— In the mean time they had been successively subdued by Egyptian and Grecian Princes, successors of Alexander of Macedon, and were then governed by Herod a despotic monarch, and Caiaphas a high-priest— What possible relation was there between this state of things and the prophesy of the Messiah by Isaiah?

Mrs Anne Taylor, widow of Brigadier General Taylor of this town, came, in trouble, with a statement that her son, Charles Taylor a young man who for the last two years has resided at Philadelphia, has been convicted and sentenced for a crime of which she said he was not guilty— I enquired what the crime was—she said Rape, which of course made it difficult for me to talk with her on the subject. She had no copy of the indictment, the verdict or the sentence; all she knew was that he was not guilty of the crime— A Petition had been presented to the Governor of Pennsylvania, she apparently knew not from whom for his pardon, and the Recorder had told them that if I would interpose the pardon would probably be granted. I wrote a Letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, stating the application of Mrs Taylor to me, and that in consideration of the great respectability of her character and the reputation hitherto unsullied of her family, I had complied with her request.

Mrs Taylor came again this afternoon, and I gave her the Letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, which I had written at her request. The atmosphere was cooled by the thunder shower, and the Summer closed after four days of heat as intense as I ever witnessed. "

This prophesy is said to have been delivered 712 years before Christ. The birth of Cyrus was 599 and his death 529 years before Christ— The prophesy therefore names Cyrus 113 years before he was born— The proclamation of Cyrus for rebuilding the temple was 536 before Christ— The building of the temple was then commenced, but was soon after suspended by command of Artaxerxes until the second year of the reign of Darius—then resumed and finished 515 before Christ— But it was not until 457 before Christ, that Cyrus went to Jerusalem, and not till 445. that Nehemiah went up— There is much obscurity and perplexing uncertainty in the chronology of these books.

I said they were the same— They were first published in a Baltimore paper, and have been copied into several others, but I have never seen them in print. I called upon Dr Frothingham and spent an hour with him— He asked me where the Latin line “Miraturque novas frondes et non sua poma” was to be found, I said in the Georgics of Virgil. He said he had sought for it there without success—but he got the volume of Hoyne’s Virgil containing the Georgics, and found it line 82 of the second Book— I asked him if he had Lowth’s translation of the Book of Isaiah, he said he had, and also that of professor Noyes, and promised to lend them both to me— I called at the Emancipator office, but Mr Leavitt was gone to Springfield— I passed to my Son’s Office 23.

C. Bond and his Son George with whom we dined, and then visited the Observatory and received Reports from Professor Pierce and Mr Bond, which were read and I took with me— Mr Paine returned with Mr Lawrence and me to Boston, and after a call at Mr James H.

Howens came with a subscription paper from an Association styling itself the Cold Water Army, proposing a Pic Nic to be held some day next week— They had a meeting last Saturday and chose this committee to report at an adjourned Meeting next Saturday, the time and place— The highest subscription was of one dollar and I added my name to the list, with a promise to attend if I can. I rode with Miss Louisa Smith, Mrs Charles and her child Mary, and my granddaughter Mary-Louisa round by the Railway-house, along by the quarries, to Braintree and over Penn’s hill homeward— I alighted at Gill the Stationer’s shop and purchased a shilling vial of Maynard and Noyes’s Ink; a supply of which for me is a prime necessity and my stock of powders for making the Article is exhausted— Mr Daniel Baxter called on me this day and spoke of the application to the Selectmen of Quincy for an immediate call of a Town-meeting for commencing the erection of a Schoolhouse as required by the donation of my father to the Town— He said Harvey Field had told him I was for having the Town-Meeting right off.— I said I should leave the Town entirely to their own discretion, and would suggest nothing that could bring on the town any charge. He said he thought the Town meeting for the next annual elections would be time enough for taking up this matter, in which I concurred— There was a primary meeting of whigs last evening at Boston. "

Mr Edward J Penniman, now a resident of Philadelphia, brought me a Letter of introduction from Josiah Randall of that City— Mr Penniman is a native of Braintree and comes now on a visit to visit his relatives in that and the neighbouring towns— The name of Penniman is very familiar to the memory of my childhood, and existed in numbers of various conditions in the North and middle precincts of old Braintree— It has now totally vanished from Quincy where it was not respectable, and whether any remnant of it is left in Braintree I am not informed— Mr Penniman’s visit to me was of mere curiosity— MrsDerby with her son Brevet second Lieutenant George H Derby came to present personally their thanks to me for the services which I have fortunately been able to render him— Mrs Derby is the daughter of a friend of my youth, Horatio Townsend, a fellow student with me in the Office of Theophilus Parsons at Newburyport in 1787–1788 and 1789—more than 30 years after this his daughter married a worthless man namedDerby, who at the time when I was a candidate for the Presidency, and about the time when this young man was born, was used as a tool against me by false and treacherous representations of conversations held by me with Mr Townsend nearly twenty years before—and which he pretended Townsend had told him— Townsend denied having told him any such thing but the slander had its run, and when Jackson’s Collector came into the custom house Derby obtained a petty office under him— He afterwards quarreled with his Masters of Jackson’s kitchen cabinet, and published one or more libels upon them. In the mean time he had deserted his wife and children, and left them to shift for themselves— In 1841. John Bell of Tennessee being Secretary of War, Mrs Derby wrote me a Letter, earnestly soliciting a warrant of Cadet at the West Point Academy for Son, and by the kindness of Mr Bell I obtained it from the appointments at large. He was admitted in June 1842, and was graduated last June 7th. on the roll of his Class. He was then assigned to the Ordnance department, but wrote to me intreating to be transferred to the Corps of topographical Engineers which I also obtained from the kindness of General Scott— I asked him where he was stationed— He said he had not yet received his orders but expected to receive them next week— In the afternoon Elizabeth C. Adams was here with Lieutenant George Thom, fresh from Washington and on the eve of returning there— I rode round to Milton and Braintree, with Mrs Charles and her infant daughter only. After we returned, Mr Thomas Loring was here, and I agreed with him to go on a fishing party to Cohasset next Tuesday week, the 22d if the weather should be fair, and if not, the first fair day afterwards. I received a note from Messrs Welch and Mann proprietors of the National Circus which came here for this day only to attend their exhibition, which I did with my granddaughter Mary-Louisa, and Charles two sons, Charles and Henry.

I received from Edward Everett, President of Harvard University, the triennial Catalogue of 1845, and a pamphlet containing the Rules and Statutes of the Professorships in the University at Cambridge, a title page in my judgment exceptionable— It is so denominated in the Constitution of this Commonwealth, by which it was recognized as a University but was also styled Harvard College— The University of Cambridge is in England—and to avoid all misunderstanding as well as to render all due honour to the founders of our cradle of education, the name of Harvard University should invariably be applied to it— Mrs N.

Mary Louisa went to Boston at 9. took her lesson at the riding school, and returned with the Cars at Noon— In the assortment of my papers, my progress is backward rather than forward I answered the Letter of Henry S. Baird at Green Bay communicating information of the death of Mr Boyd— This volume of copies of my Letters is missing, and I know not where to look for it— I felt this afternoon the necessity of commencing the Report of the Committee of the Board of Overseers of the University, upon the Observatory—but entered upon it with so little spirit that I almost despair of ever finishing it.— I merely read the reports to the Committee of Professor Peirce, Perkins professor of Astronomy and Mathematics; and of William Cranch Bond, Observator—and wrote the introductory sentence of the Report of the Committee— I find that in the pamphlet sent me by President Everett of Rules and Statutes of the Professorships in the University of Cambridge there is no notice of the Perkins professorship of Astronomy and Mathematics. In the second volume of Quincy’s history of Harvard University pages 392. 566 and 637—all the proceedings for the construction and establishment of an Astronomical observatory until the publication of that work in 1840 are contained, and in page 430 is noticed the bequest of James Perkins at his death in August 1823 to the President and fellows of Harvard College of 20000 dollars for the purpose of founding such a professorship, as they with the consent of the Overseers of the College should judge most useful to the university and the public—a Question remains, how and when it was decided that the Perkins professorship should be a professorship of Astronomy and Mathematics— This is a lacuna or gap to be filled up in preparation for the report of the Committee: and there is another for the measures in process of execution to procure a Frauenhofer Refractor of the largest size— I received from Dr Frothingham Lowth’s translation of Isaiah, and the first volume of professor Noyes’s translation of the bible prophets including Isaiah; which will furnish me with occupation enough till next winter— I went up the hill to see the Sun set but he went down in a thick cloud "

Isaiah 61.1. Luke 4.18.  In the year 1841. George Brown then of Beverley and a stranger to me, but since then sometime Commissioner of the United States at the Sandwich Islands wrote me a Letter requesting me to versify in English this passage of the book of Isaiah, which I did and the lines were published by him in some Newspaper. A day or two since I looked for them among my papers—but found them not, and I know not where to search for them.  Mr Lunt preached this morning from 1. Chronicles 16.37. [“]So he left there before the Ark of the covenant of the Lord, Asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every day’s work required” And 1. Peter 2.5. “Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God, by Jesus Christ.” Mr Lunt appears to have a fondness for double texts, taking one from the old and the other from the New testament— His object was to illustrate them one by the other— But the verse from the Chronicles is the institution by David of the great musical establishment by David, in the worship before the Ark of the Covenant, when he brought it up from the house of Obed-Edom and placed it in a tent, preliminary to the building of the Temple— The history of this establishment of Music vocal and instrumental, as forming a part of the daily service of divine worship is highly interesting, but was not noticed by Mr Lunt— The instruments named in the common English Bible are (ch 13 v. 8) Harps, Psalteries, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets— [(]ch. 15. v 28.) cornet— Psalm 98 Shawms. Daniel 3.4. Sackbut, flute and dulcimer— Thomson’s Septuagint calls Psalteries and Harps Nablas and kinyras— But there is little connection between this institution for the daily religious concert of music, by David, and the exhortations of Peter, to all his disciples, converts to Christianity to become an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices— Yet the analogy between them is not unnatural— In the afternoon Mr Lunt’s sermon was from 1. Thessalonians 1.5. [“]For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much assurance.” The argument was upon the miracles performed by Jesus Christ and the Apostles, considered as evidences of the truth of Christianity— Towards evening I rode with my Son down to Ex President Quincy’s, and found him at the old family mansion, to which he has returned for a Summer family residence. I inquired about the papers which passed between us last Summer relating to the Observatory at Cambridge— He said he had them all and would send them to me— On my return home I found P. P. F. Degrand here, who soon returned to Boston. "

I received this day with the daily Boston Newspapers, Atlas Courier and Daily whig, and the National Intelligencer from Washington Littell’s living age N. 122 and a pamphlet of 86 pages 8vo. being a Statement of the controversy between Lewis Tappan and Edward E. Dunbar— These daily Newspapers and pamphlets furnish reading from day to day so copious and absorbing of time, that it leaves little or none for writing or for reading of permanent interest—day after day slips imperceptibly away, and nothing useful is atchieved— This afternoon Mr Charles Sumner, and Dr Howe came out from Boston, and invited me to attend, and preside at a public Meeting proposed to be held at Boston, a week from to-morrow Tuesday the 22d of this month, with a view to pass Resolutions expressing the public feeling at the recent kidnapping and abduction of a negro man who had escaped from his master at New-Orleans and landed in the neighbourhood of Boston— He was pursued, captured and ship’d off for New Orleans, by the Captain of the vessel in which he made his escape, unknown to the captain— But for retaking him the Captain had no authority from the owner of the Negro. There was a meeting last evening of a few persons indignant at this outrage upon the Laws of the Commonwealth and upon the rights of human nature, who resolved to call a public meeting, and these gentlemen came out as a Committee from this primary meeting to give me the invitation— After expressing my sense of the honour done me, I suggested some difficulties, owing to the state of my health, and especially the near extinction of my voice, disqualifying me, if not from attending at least from presiding at such a meeting, I finally promised to attend the meeting if my health would permit; and to preside, if I should be able to rely upon my voice for a hearing— From my house the Gentlemen went up the hill to my Son’s but he was out for a Sea bath, and they did not see him— Mrs John and Mrs Charles went to Boston, this afternoon, and came back at 9 this Evening with my granddaughter, Louisa Catherine, who finally comes home from Mrs Sedgwick’s school at Lenox, where she has passed two years in the course of her education. She was 15 on the 13th. of last Month— "

Fahrenheit 68 at Sunrise 5.40 Douche  The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do, in the end thereof?  Jeremiah 5.31—  The day commenced with a continuation of Summer heat, beclouded. About 9 in the morning there was a light shower of rain, immediately after which the wind came round to the Northwest, with a clear sky, and autumnal cold increasing through the day, the bright sun notwithstanding— I rode this afternoon with Mrs John and Mrs Charles and little Mary to Weymouth— We stop’d at Mr Minott Thayer’s house but he was not at home. I requested his niece to inform him that in calling to pay my respects to him, I had intended also to remind him that some years since (19 May 1841) Mr Asa French and Mr Benjamin V. French in behalf of the inhabitants of Braintree had borrowed of me a volume, being a copy made by my father’s direction for him, and left by him to me, of the original record of births marriages and deaths in the town of Braintree, from its first settlement in 1640.— The original itself was in the possession of the town Clerk of Braintree, but so mutilated and defaced, that he wanted my copy made some twenty years before to aid them in having a fair copy made for themselves—after which they promised to return mine to me— Upwards of five years have since passed away, and although I had occasionally missed the book I had almost forgotten the loan of it, till a few days since casually looking over my diary of 1841—I found in it the entry of this incident—the thousandth memento for me of the usefulness of keeping a diary— We visited also Mrs Mercy Tufts and her two unmarried daughters Susan and Mercy— Mrs Tufts is 83 years of age, and is confined to the house by the infirmities of age. At this time her bodily health is good and she lives cheerful and contented. We returned by the old County road over Penn’s hill which never fails to bring to my memory with a pleasing and tender melancholy the many walks over the same ground of my childhood from 1774 to 1778. when I first went to France— On my return home I found that Ex President Quincy had been here, and left the Papers relating to the Observatory at Cambridge which had passed between us in the Spring and Summer of 1845. These were all intended as preparatory materials and vouchers for a report of the Committee to the board of Overseers to be presented at their meeting during the Session of the Legislature in January 1846. The decline of my health towards the close of the Summer, and through the autumn of 1845 disabled me for the composition of the report, and none was made at the winter Session— The same Committee was continued for the present year and on my return from Washington last Month I found the subject precisely where we had left it this time last year— In the meantime the whole subject had so far faded upon my memory that I am more unprepared for writing the report to the overseers than I was then and although my health is partially restored, I am in deep concern for the perseverance and energy my only hope of which is in the passage from holy writ on the next page— "

The french protestant bible of Ostervald has le violon et les orgues, and the German Bible of Luther has die Geiger und Pfeifer— In Exodus 15.20 Miriam is said to have taken a timbrel in her hand, which the Septuagint calls τυμπανον and Thomson translates timbrel— Silver trumpets. Numbers 10.2— The Septuagint calls them σαλπιγγας— Ram’s horn Trumpets Joshua 6. I consulted the English translation of Calmet’s Dictionary in the third volume of which among the fragments illustrating scripture, p. 337. &c is an Article on Musical Instruments, and three plates with nearly thirty engraved representations of antient musical instruments among which a harp from Herculaneum, and two other specimens of harps closely resembling the modern forms of that instrument. But after all it is admitted that there is no certainty what was the form of any one of the musical instruments mentioned in the old Testament "

Moreover, I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the candle Jeremiah 25.10.  Instead of the sound of the millstones and the light of the candle, the Septuagint reads the odour of myrrh and the light of the lamp.  Dr Frothingham preached at the Temple this morning from 2. Chronicles 15.15—last clause of the verse “and the Lord gave them rest round about.” This text lead to the expectation of a discourse upon the blessings of Peace, and the comforts of tranquility to Nations—but after a general allusion to the bearing of the text upon that condition of human Society, and remarking how happy the lot of ever Nation must be in the enjoyment of rest all about, Dr. Frothingham said that the Sentiment of the text was quite as applicable to individuals as to Nations, and that he should confine his consideration of it to that view of its Operation— He then enlarged upon rest all about as essential and indispensable to the well-being of man, and pointed out the various sources from which rest round about must be derived— The Greek and Roman philosophy upon the blessing of rest is painted in Horace’s Ode to Grosphus 2.16. Otium Divos rogat impotenti Prensus Egaeo, and the Hebrews both of the Old and New Covenant regard rest as the consummation of all happiness in Heaven as well as on Earth. The Bible tells us that almighty God, after labouring six days in the creation of the world and of man, rested the seventh day and hallowed it— This was the institution of the Sabbath, and consecrated to religious sanctity the alternation of labour and repose as a condition of human existence embracing all its relations and dependencies.— Mr Frothingham made however no allusion to the Sabbath, and understood the words rest round about in this passage as imparting only a state of peace and quiet. He dined with us, together with my Son, and in the afternoon preached from 2 Chronicles 15.17—the last clause of the verse— “Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.” Mr Frothingham dwelt upon the sacred regard to truth in all the narratives of the Scriptures—noticing the plain simple manner in which they relate all the errors and vices and crimes of the most exalted personages of their histories exemplified in the persons of Adam, Noah, Abraham, David, Solomon and Asa himself. He explained the qualified sense of the word perfect as applied to the heart of Asa all his days; and noticed the exceptions of deviation from rectitude with which he is charged by the historian of the Chronicles himself. He cautioned his hearers also against the error of concluding that perfection of conduct necessarily follows from perfection of the heart— Mr Loring of Hingham was at Meeting this afternoon, and called here after the service. I agreed to go with him on a fishing party to Cohasset next Tuesday if the weather should be fair— Dr. Frothingham with Charles and his wife and we had visits from George T. Bigelow, and John P.

At 6 O’Clock when I intended and had prepared to start for Hingham the whole firmament still threatened a tempest— I walked round the railway square, and saw no relaxation of the atmosphere— Breakfasted at 8 and the firmament began to soften its frown;—after 9 it was apparent that the clouds were dispersing and late as it was I ordered out Albert and the Carriage, and started for Hingham— I had barely crossed the railway bridge near my gate when I met Mr Loring in his chaise with a present of two fine mackrel, and a box of Seek no further Apples— He said there had been a heavy gale of wind off the coast last night and the surf on the beach this morning was so boisterous, that it was impossible to get the boat in which we were to embark for fishing out from her moorings. So that our fishing party must be postponed to some future day, and if I had gone to Hingham as I had proposed this morning we still should not have been able to go out— Mr Loring proceeded to Boston, and was succeeded here by an Old man named James Ward a claimant of a pension for services during the revolutionary War in the Deane frigate, and at the battle of White Plains— He had been here on theof last Month, and referred me to Elias Hasket Derby Esqr. Justice of Peace in Boston, who had heretofore had charge of his papers, and transmitted them to the Pension Office at Washington but had obtained nothing— This was confirmed by Mr Derby to whom I applied at his office on the— Ward says that the pension due to him, he believes has been obtained by a man named Stephen Ward fraudulently in as much as he Stephen Ward was not born at the time of the battle of White Plains— I told him that as I knew not the reasons why his claim for a pension had been disallowed I saw nothing that I could do for him but upon my return to Washington to represent his case to the Commissioner of Pensions which I promised to do— In the meantime I advised him to have a petition or written statement of his claim drawn up, and furnished to me to take with me, and he promised that he would— The weather cleared up bright and I rode in the barouche with my daughters and the child— There was a whig meeting at Boston this Evening preliminary to the Convention for the nomination of Governor tomorrow— "

I had a sleepless Night— Was up between two and three O’Clock of the morning—returned to bed, and lingered without repose till five when I rose for the day, with a sore throat, a voice nearly extinct, a redoubled agitation of nerves, and a tremor little short of absolute disqualification for writing. My Socratic demon, whispered to me authoritatively not to attempt to preside at the Meeting at Faneuil hall tomorrow evening upon the case of a Slave who had escaped from New-Orleans, in a merchant vessel from this State commanded by a Captain Hannum— The Slave had secreted himself in the vessel unknown to the Captain, and succeeded in a getting to land at South Boston Hannum pursued and found him there—seized him without warrant or authority of any kind—ship’d him onboard of another vessel bound to New-Orleans and sent him back to his Master— Attempts were made to follow the vessel in which he was ship’d with a writ of Habeas-Corpus but without success— The meeting in Faneuil Hall is called to ascertain the facts of the case and to consult upon measures to be taken for preventing the repetition of similar cases, and I had promised if possible to attend and preside at this meeting. I am disabled by the act of God, and was obliged to write to my Son, requesting him to give notice of the fact to Dr Howe, and Mr Charles Sumner, the Committee who had given me the invitation— Unfortunately my Letter to my Son was not sent— The Convention of the whigs for the nomination of Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth for the year 1847. was held this day at Faneuil Hall, and George N. Briggs was unanimously nominated for re-election as Governor, and John Reed as Lieutenant Governor. A set of Resolutions prepared by Daniel Webster was adopted, and another offered by Stephen C Phillips was rejected— There are two divisions in the party, one based upon public principle and the and the other upon manufacturing and commercial interest— I had a morning visit form Mr Lunt, and confined myself to the house for the day. I make no progress in the Report of the Committee of the Overseers upon the Observatory and am even diverted by debility from the searching examination of the papers upon which the report must be founded. I received this day a note from President Edward Everett proposing the immediate publication of W. C. Bond’s Report and Observations which the American Academy have offered to have performed; upon which it will be necessary for me to consult Mr Abbott Lawrence. I received also a Letter from Edward C Delavan Ballston Centre Septr 15 1846. with a pamphlet containing ten Lectures by Dr Eliphalet Nott President of Union College Schenectady on the use of intoxicating liquors—which he requests me to read and of which he proposes to have numberless copies published in Stereotype "

Jeremiah 42.5.6.  This is one of the passages illustrative of the fundamental principle of the Hebrew Religion, Politics and Morals— Obedience to the will of God, whether good or evil was sure to be rewarded with prosperity—and this will of God was to be revealed to them by the prophet whom they sent to God, to learn his will. The will of God, revealed to the prophet’s ear by the word to his eye in vision, or to his Memory in a dream, was the summum bonum for which the Grecian philosophers made such long, painful, and fruitless research— Thomson’s translation from the Septuagint of this 6th. verse, reads—Whether it be agreeable, or disagreeable we will hearken to the voice of the Lord our God in respect to that for which we send thee to him that it may be the better for us.  I received this morning a Letter from Dr Howe again urging my attend at the Faneuil Hall meeting this Evening. I had a good night’s sleep last Night and this morning the sore throat had passed away—the hoarseness much subsided and the voice almost entirely recovered though still very feeble. Ever since the day when Dr Howe and Charles Sumner came with the invitation, and I had given them the conditional promise to attend, the notification of the meeting in all the daily newspapers had stated that it would be presided over by me— As this day advanced I felt returning strength and immediately after dinner I concluded to go at all hazards— I went up the hill, and found my Son who had been into Boston and returned, was with his family at dinner. Dr Bowditch came in soon after from Boston to request that I would write a note approbatory of the meeting to be read there and account for my absence— I told him I had concluded to go, and agreed to meet him at his house at 6 this Evening— I went accordingly with my Son, and found assembled at Bowditch’s house a small tea party of the gentlemen who had called the Meeting— At 7 we went to Faneuil Hall where a great crowd of people were assembled filling every nook and corner of the room, including numbers of ladies filling the galleries— The chair was assigned to me by acclamation. Stephen C. Phillips and Samuel May were chosen Vice-Presidents andAndrew Secretary to the Meeting. It continued till about ten in the Evening, sundry Resolutions were adopted with inconsiderable opposition. Among the Speakers was my Son, and when he rose I resigned the chair to Mr Stephen C. Phillips— The meeting closed with a vote of thanks to me moved by Edmund Quincy and carried not without opposition— With my Son I returned from the Hall to Quincy, and reached home after 11 at Night.

I had a comfortable night’s rest, and slept this morning until near 5. at the striking of which by the Clock I rose—but my principal complaint hung by me all this day. Gibbon remarks in the Memoir of his own life, that the greatest discomfort of his old age was that in proportion as he advanced in years, the power of hope over his mind gradually declined— My principal annoyance in the decline of years is that I rise in the morning with thoughts occupied exclusively with concern for my health, and the encroachments of gradual decay—the flickering of the light in the socket.— We had a morning visit from Ex-President Josiah Quincy with his eldest Son’s wife, and his eldest daughter Miss Elizabeth Susan Quincy— Mr Quincy has returned for his Summer residence to the family mansion in this town which he inherited from his grandfather Coll. Josiah Quincy who built the house, after that in which John Hancock was born, and which he had purchased and dwelt in after the death of Hancock’s father the minister, was burnt. I say inherited; but it was bequeathed to him by his grandfather’s will, subject to the right of dower of his third wife Ann Marsh, who survived him. Coll. Josiah Quincy died in 1783 and his widow dwelt in the house, until after the marriage of the devisee in 1800, she by a composition of mutual agreement she relinquished it to him. He made it his summer residence for many years residing in Winter at Boston, until in 1829—being elected President of Harvard University he necessarily resided the year round at Cambridge— Having resigned that Office on the 1st. of October 1845, he returned to Boston for the winter, and to what the Revd. Mr Clark calls the Quincy hive for the Summer. His eldest Son Josiah junr is now Mayor of the city of Boston, and his wife prefers Nahant for a Summer residence to Quincy— But she is now on a visit to her beau-pere and belle mere— I read Dr Gilman’s reminiscences of New England at the close of the 18th. century, and especially of the Revd. Stephen Peabody of Atkinson New-Hampshire, and of his second wife my mother’s sister Elizabeth— If the protestant creed tolerated canonization, those two persons would have deserved to stand among the foremost on the Calendar. I read also Dr Lamson’s discourse in defence and support of the congregational form of worship— He extols it for its simplicity— I prefer it to the Roman Catholic which admits, and to the English Episcopal which seems to admit the power of the Priest to grant absolution for sins— But there is no Christian Church with which I could not join in social worship— I received a Letter from Misses Kilburn and Healy late of Boston, now keeping a boarding and day school for young Ladies at Baltimore, with their prospectus.

The prohibition of War, as a religious and moral principle belongs exclusively to the Christian dispensation, if indeed it is included in that— War so far from being discountenanced in the old testament is frequently commanded, and the total destruction of the Canaanitish Nations, was not only enjoined upon the children of Israel, but their disobedience to that command by sparing a remnant of the victims, was held and declared to be a crime for which their own destruction was doomed— For the same offence Saul forfeited his kingdom and his life, and here the prophet Jeremiah a captive in Chaldea denounces a curse upon every man who keepeth back his sword from blood—  The day slip’d again from under me.— I had seen in the ship news of yesterday’s Boson Newspapers, the welcome announcement of the arrival from Alexandria and Georgetown D.C. of the Schooner Forest king Captain Kelly, in which my chest of books and papers, with many other valuable articles had been ship’d— This day my son procured the delivery of them in Boston—they were brought out in the freight train of railway Cars, and landed at our own house this evening— The vessel was much out of time, and I had almost despaired of ever hearing from her more—especially after we knew she had sailed from Alexandria, there had been two destructive gales of wind on our coast fatal to great numbers of vessels— But Captain Kelley had evaded them by putting into Norfolk, and waiting there for fair weather.— My health is still unsettled, capricious and wavering— My nights restless and dispirited— I concluded my Letter to Dr. Alvan Lamson to return Dr Gilman’s Reminiscences, and to take friendly notice of the Discourse upon the Congregational mode of worship, which I have preferred to all ever since Dudley Atkins at Newburyport republished an old dialogue between a blacksmith and a student of divinity, to prove the super-excellence of the Church of England’s book of Common prayer— In my mind the blacksmith’s argument recoiled upon himself— Yet I have joined in worship with the episcopal church both in England and in this country, down to the present day, though without ever subscribing to the creeds of that church even as confined in this Country to the Apostle’s and the Nicene-creed, and discard in the Athanasian altogether. I rode this afternoon in the Coach with my two daughters and little Mary over Milton hill, and over the Bridge to a shop where Mrs Charles stop’d two or three minutes. On returning home we found Mr and Mrs Thomas P. Smith, with two small children a boy and a girl. Mrs Smith brought with her a beautiful bunch of flowers, and requested of me a contribution for a volume of miscellaneous essays which she is about to publish, and I promised to furnish one. "

Fahrenheit 44 at Sunrise 5.53 Cloudy Clear  Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the Nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms—  Jeremiah 51.20—  This is expressed with so much obscurity that it is not clear who is intended by the battle-axe— It may be Nebuchadnezzar—or Cyrus—or Jacob—or figuratively Christ— In the Septuagint—the energy of the image and the image and the image itself is lost— The Genevan French and Luther’s German translations substitute for the battle-axe a hammer, and as the battle-axe itself is a type of all possible weapons of aggressive War, to name it, followed by weapons of War generally without specification rather weakens the idea it would convey if it stood alone— But the battle-axe is a weapon far more terrific than a hammer.  The Revd. Joseph Henry Allen, a graduate at Harvard University of 1840, a grandson of my long cherished friend and sometime chum, not long since deceased, professor Henry Ware, now pastor of the third Congregational church of Roxbury at Jamaica Plains preached at the Temple this day, by exchange with Mr Lunt— His morning text was from Ecclesiastes 1.8. “All thing are full of labour, man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing.” He drew from his text a parallel between the lives and characters of David and of Solomon— The father and the Son both persons of transcendent renown among the children of men Seated on the pinnacle of glory— Tarnished with the pollution of shame— Mighty Monarchs. Holy prophets, Sublime Poets, venerable sages— David from a stripling Shepherd’s boy, rising through the gradation of a minstrel page to Saul, a commander of his army, the husband of his daughter, a banished fugitive from his kingdom, and a leader of the Philistines—then Captain of a band of outlaws— King of the tribes of Judah and Simeon after the death of Saul, and then thirty three years king of all the tribes. Solomon receiving from him the kingdom as a bequest—reigning forty years; endowed with wisdom specially from heaven, prosperous and happy beyond all other men yet falling in his old age beguiled by fair idolatresses, into the foulest worship of the heathens— This parallel and contrast are deeply impressive and were well handled but might have more widely extended— Mr Allen dined with us and after dinner preached from Luke 10.29.—“And who is my neighbour?” This text naturally introduces the parable of the good Samaritan, of which Sterne has made such admirable use— Mr Allen barely alluded to it, and meddled not at all with the narrative— The subject embraces the origin and history of the feuds and divisions between the Jews and the Samaritans— I suppose them to have arisen as early as the elevation of Saul to the kingdom; and though smothered during his reign, and those of David and Solomon, broke out broke out and became perpetual, on the revolts of the ten tribes from Rehoboam under Jeroboam the Son of Nebat— I was present as a delegate from our Temple Church at the Ordination of Mr Allen at Roxbury on the 18th. of October 1843.

I am involving myself in scriptural enquiries beyond my depth and the possible consequences of which begin to discourage me in the pursuit—and absorb too much of my time— This conviction bears upon me especially since I have come to the reading of the prophets— From beginning on the first of last December to read every morning two chapters of the common English Bible without note or commentary, I have come to read four chapters every day—the corresponding chapters of Charles Thomson’s version of the Septuagint— Hewlett’s and Scott’s notes and commentaries—consulting occasionally Ostervald’s French and Luther’s German Bible, the translation of Calmet, and even the original Septuagint— I have barely touched upon Lowth’s Isaiah, and Noyes’s translation of the prophets— These have started multitudes of new questions that I cannot stop to investigate and I must discard, and give up the chase of the inaccessible mountaintops— The transpositions of the chapters of the Book of Jeremiah, as scrupulously followed by The Septuagint of Thomson is so perplexing that it is like a dislocation of all my limbs—  I slept this morning till near four, and rose at that hour— The constellation of Orion shone full in the Meridian, with his outposts Procyon and Sirius— Venus rose after five hastening to her conjunction with the Sun and her station as evening Star.

As an Adamant, harder than flint, have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.  Ezekiel 3.9.  Adamant. It is remarkable that this beautifully sonorous word, has in the English language has no definite meaning or rather has three distinct and separate meanings— It is an imaginary stone, harder than flint as in this passage of the common Bible— It is the diamond, and so called in the French and German translations of this passage. And it is the loadstone. The Septuagint does not name it— No progress with the Report to the Overseers on the Observatory. Quite convalescent from my late Sore throat and debility— Voice still somewhat hoarse— Barely returned my recent arrears of Journal— I have received 1. A Letter from Mr Frye Washington— 24 Septr. mentioning an application to purchase a site for an ice house on the margin of the mill pond of the Columbia Mills— This Letter must be answered. 2. A Letter from J. M. Elam Baton Rouge Louisiana Septr. 1846—enclosing a printed paper signed by him, proposing sundry questions concerning Texas and the Western boundary of Louisiana, upon which he desires me to give my opinion with regard to a line of boundary, such as the pretension of France could have urged, and he says that in order to sustain President Polk for sending an armed force on the Rio del Norte an appeal has been made to all I have ever said as to that rivers having been claimed by France as the Western limit of antient Louisiana— This Letter also should be answered; but no pretensions of France to the Rio del Norte, as the boundary of Louisiana could extend inland from the mouth of that river, which could itself be claimed only as a half way point from La Salle’s landing at the Bay of St. Bernard, and the small detachment which he left there when he went Northward in search of the Mississippi and was murdered on his way. Which detachment was exterminated within two years whether by Spaniards or by Indians has never been ascertained, and was never after heard of— Nor has it ever been proved where the spot of La Salle’s landing and Settlement was, the name of the Bay of St. Bernard not having been given by him— The appeal of Mr Polk’s partizans to my arguments in discussion with the Spanish minister in the Negotiation for the Florida Treaty is a dishonest subterfuge to escape from the obligation which fixed by solemn agreement of both parties the boundary line at the Sabine where it had been already fixed in 1805 by a military convention between General Wilkinson and the commander of the Spanish troops in Mexico— 3. A printed circular from L. V. Badger and Co. Boston advertising and recommending Leighton’s Patent Enema Chair— The word enema is not in Johnson’s nor in Webster’s Dictionary.— I did not know its meaning, and resorted to Rees’s Encyclopaedia where I found it. I saw the Sunset from the Northern porch of Charles’s house at 5.46— For he rises before 6 in the morning and sets before 6 at Night— My Son was here this Evening— "

And behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the ink-horn by his side reported the matter, saying I have done, as thou hast commanded me.  Ezekiel 9.11.  This man clothed with linen and with an inkhorn at his side, is called in the Septuagint a man clothed in a long robe, and a girdle of sapphire about his loins— The clothing of linen is said by Scott to denote a Priest, and not a Soldier— The inkhorn may be of the same import, but Hewlett thinks the inkhorn out of place, and that ink was not used in those days; but how a man could be girt with a sapphire girdle is more questionable than that he should have an inkhorn at his side— In the vision of Ezekiel this man was charged with two distinct offices—the first was to set a mark upon the foreheads of the righteous persons who lamented and abhorred the crimes and corruptions of the people, and were therefore to be saved from the general destruction of the city: and this was what he reported he had performed: the second was to go in between the wheels and the Cherubim of the Sapphire throne, and fill his hand with coals of fire and scatter them over the city— He was at once a minister of Justice of Mercy, and of Vengeance—  We had a visit this afternoon from this Lady one of the three maiden daughters of my Mother’s cousin Quincy Thaxter of Hingham. I received a second Letter from Frederic Oxnard of Portland Maine Septr. 25. 1846. requesting an Autograph— I receive multitudes of such Letters from entire Strangers none of which I have answered for several years— I have not been without questions of the minor morals whether this course is perfectly right— In good fellowship and good neighbourhood, a civil request is entitled to a civil answer— But no one has the right to ask an autograph of an entire stranger, and the subscription of a name, which collectors of autographs generally desire, is liable to dangerous accidents, and to possible monstrous abuses— A discussion upon the right, would be useless, and exposed to ridicule so that I have consider the omission to answer such requests as a prudent and justifiable mode of declining to gratify them I am not however perfectly with my own conclusion— A request for an autograph from a stranger is an act of personal respect and kind feeling— It deserves return in the same spirit though not necessarily witch compliance— Were I not disabled for writing I would in every case comply, and in the omission to answer, my apology to myself is disability controuling my will. I received also a Letter from Daniel Adams of Keene New-Hampshire September 24. making enquiries of the genealogy of the Adams family, to ascertain whether he is consanguineous, as Sir Toby Belch says with us; but from the account he gives of himself he appears not to be a chip of the Old block— The Great Western Steamer arrived at New York in 17 days from Liverpool.

The reading of this passage in Thomson’s version of the Septuagint is—[“]Now when the wall is fallen, will they not say to you, Where is the anointing with which you anointed it”— But the discourse is of cement and not of ointment—not of salve but of untempered mortar— The daubing of the common bible is better than the ointment of the Septuagint— My wife went to Boston this afternoon, with Mrs John Adams and her daughter Mary Louisa— I dined with my Son and his family up the hill, and about Sunset paid my first visit to my neighbours Mr and Mrs. N. Emmons in their new house. I found them just ready for tea, with two of their six children— Mr Emmons’s business is in Boston to which he goes by the morning Railway Cars, and returns between 4. and 5 in the afternoon— The Steamboat and the Railway are working out a revolution in the domestic life of the people of this and of many other Countries, the extent of which it is impossible to foretell. Its tendency here is to concentrate and multiply population— The Railway travel and transportation is of infinite importance to this town, both in its manufacturing interests almost coeval with its first settlements, and to its treasure richer that Mines of diamond or gold—its granite rocks, deemed worthless, little less than half a century ago, but now duly appreciated—and assiduously worked Mr. Emmons walked home with me but declined to come it— The Ladies went to Boston in the Coach and returned home all safe between 7 and 8 O’Clock, but we were kept till near 9 in painful suspense for my grandson John Quincy, who goes every day to school at Boston, and returns with the evening train of Cars.— By an unlucky and careless accident an engine without any cars attached to it, ran off the railway bridge at the draw, which was raised, and fell into the river— The cars coming from Boston at 7 in the evening were thus arrested at the Neponset Station two or three hours— John Quincy was a passenger in one of them— As soon as the Ladies came home they sent the Carriage back in search of him— He had undertaken to walk from the Neponset Station home, and met the Carriage going for him near Mr Quincy’s house— He got here safe to my grateful relief, before nine. I received a Letter from Thomas Cowperthwait and Co. printers at Philadelphia, with the present of a copy of a new Edition of Sanderson’s Biography of the signers of the Declaration of Independence in one large Octavo volume handsomely bound— The first edition of this work in nine 8vo. volumes was gotten up with great difficulties and many delays— But it was eventually prosperous. It dragged heavily along for a series of years till completed; but was then soon disposed of— A second Edition in three volumes was equally successful, and this I believe is the third; said to be revised and edited by Robert T. Conrad— It is well printed, on good paper, but the engraved portraits are miserable.— Those in the original edition were no better than indifferent. The life of my father was by Edward Ingersoll. "

As I live, saith the Lord God, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him, in the midst of Babylon shall die— Ezekiel 17.15.16.  The kingdom of Israel, that is of the ten tribes, often called in the prophetic books by the single name of Ephraim, was conquered by Shalmanezer king of Assyria, and Hoshea its last king with the mass of his people were carried into the Assyrian captivity 721 years before Christ— Hezekiah was then king of Judah, and he and his kingdom were miraculously delivered, from the Assyrians, whose Capitol was Nineveh, and 180000 of whom perished in one night—slain by the angel of the Lord— The kingdom of Judah continued in the line of David—from Hezekiah—through Manasseh, Amon and Josiah in lineal descent, till Josiah was vanquished and slain by Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt. The people of the land then made his son Jehoahaz king, but he reigned only 3 months— Pharaoh Necho carried him away to Egypt where he died. Pharaoh made his brother Eliakim king and turned his name to Jehoiakim— He was tributary to Pharaoh Necho, who in his turn was vanquished by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon— Jehoiakim then became his tributary, but after three years rebelled against him and was carried by him in fetters to Babylon— His son Jehoiachin succeeded him, but after a reign of 3 months surrendered himself to Nebuchadnezzar who carried him to Babylon where he remained in captivity 37. years.— Nebuchadnezzar then made Mattaniah a third son of Josiah king, and changed his name to Zedekiah and he reigned 11. years in Jerusalem— In the 9th. year he rebelled and Nebuchadnezzar after a siege of three years took and destroyed Jerusalem, abolished the kingdom of Judah, carried Zedekiah to Riblah, slew his sons before his eyes, put out his eyes, bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to Babylon. 588 years before Christ.— 133 years after the extinction of the kingdom of Israel— Zedekiah had sworn allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar—and rebelled against him— This prophesy of Ezekiel predicted the punishment that awaited him— This word of the Lord is said to have been announced by the prophet six years before the accomplishment of the prophesy— Mr William Cranch Bond, the Astronomical Observator at Harvard University came from Cambridge this morning to enquire concerning the printing of his observations which were submitted with his and professor Peirce’s report to the Committee of the board of Overseers at their late Meeting— I had received a Letter last week from President Edward Everett on the subject, but was not aware of Mr Bond’s impatience for the printing of his observations— I had intended to take the advice of Mr Abbott Lawrence for accepting the offer of the American Academy to pay the expence of the printing, but have postponed from day to day my visit to Mr Lawrence.— I promised Mr Bond to make it if the weather will permit to-morrow, and to advise with him for making a permanent arrangement with the American Academy for printing the future observations, as well as those already made to which Mr Bond readily assented— My Son and his wife and daughter were here this evening.

Court Street— I afterwards called at Dr N. L. Frothingham’s and at the ex judge John Davis’s to see them but neither of them was at home, or perhaps visible— At Mr James H Foster’s I saw Mrs Foster and their daughters Louisa and Mary— At a quarter past 2 I returned to the cars for Quincy, and with my Son, my two granddaughters Mary Louisa and Louisa Catherine, and my grandson John Quincy came out in the special train— We found Albert and the Carriage waiting for us at the station and reached home to dine before 3— Mrs Stebbins and Elizabeth C Adams were here at Tea—and spent the Evening "

Behold therefore, I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will deliver thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Ezekiel 25.6.7.  This is said of the Ammonites the descendants from Lot, by one of his daughters— This chapter contains similar denunciations against Moab, the progeny of Lot by his other daughter, and against Seir the Land of the Edomites the descendants from Esau— They are threatened with destruction, because they exulted at the subjugation of the children of Israel— All these Nations had nothing in common with the Philistines or any of the Canaanitish Nations, which were descended from the son of Ham Canaan.  This was communion day at the Temple, and the day when the hours of the morning and afternoon service are changed for the Season to begin henceforth at half past 10 instead of 10 in the morning, and at a quarter before two instead of a quarter after 2 in the afternoon— Mr Lunt’s morning text was Revelation 5.6. “And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth”— Mr Lunt commented upon the frequent use in the new Testament of the emblematical representation of Christ as a Lamb, of all animated nature perhaps the most characteristic of innocence gentleness and cheerfulness— He referred also to the four other beasts so conspicuous in the vision of the apocalypse with the faces of a lion, a bullock, or as the book calls it a calf a man and an eagle, but he did not remark the identity of the same complex animal in the vision of the prophet Ezekiel, nor did he observe that these four faces are understood to be indicative of the four Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John— After the Sermon and the dismission of the auditory except the members of the church, Mr Lunt administered the communion of which I partook feeling the obligation of divesting myself of every sentiment of animosity anger and resentment against any and every fellow creature of the human family, and praying for the reign of Justice and Truth upon Earth— Mr Lunt’s text this afternoon was from Romans 10.10. For with the heart man believeth unto Righteousness—leaving out the remainder of the verse— He said believers might be of three classes. 1. Mere believers by the act of the Understanding. 2. believers with the heart, in which the affections are engaged, and 3— Believers unto righteousness, resulting from the engagement of the affections in the belief— My Son and his wife and daughter spent the Evening here— "

I will give thee the opening of the mouth is the promise of inspiration. The word of the Lord came to the prophets— They never spoke in their own names— The opening of their mouths was given them from the Lord— They only repeated what they heard and their form of Speech was “Thus saith the Lord.”— There were false prophets, who used the same form of Speech, besides the Priests of the Heathen Deities, Baal, Dagon, Moloch and many others a catalogue of whom may be found in Milton’s Paradise Lost— The false prophet was to be put to death, whether he prophesied in the name of any other God than Jehovah, or in his name without authority. The fulfilment of the prophesy was the test by which the people were to know whether the pretender to prophesy in the name of Jehovah was a true, or a false prophet— Ezekiel, and the other true prophets bitterly denounced and not unfrequently put to death the false ones, who usually prophesied smooth things. The Office of the true prophet was one of extreme danger— They were always persecuted—and often put to death—  Mr Minott Thayer came this afternoon, and introduced a relation of his by the name of Whitney— I reminded him of the Book which Benjamin V. French and Asa French, had borrowed of me on the 19th. of May 1841. with a promise to return it after having a copy of it made— He acknowledged the obligation of the promise to which he had also pledged his word, and again promised that he would see to have it returned but he intimated that by the neglect of Benjamin V. French the copy of it has not yet been made— I received a Letter from James Maguire, a member of the Senate in the Legislature of this Commonwealth, Randolph Octr 2. 1846. informing me that at a Convention of whig delegates of District N. 8. assembled at Dedham Octr. 1. instt. a Committee of five Gentlemen were chosen to make known to me the doings of that body, and requesting me to name a day and hour when the Committee may meet me, and communicate to me the wishes of the Convention— There is no distinct intimation of what they were; but the convention unanimously nominated me by ballot for re-election to represent the district in the 30th. Congress of the United States—and they passed two sets of Resolutions, corresponding with those which were adopted by the State Convention held at Boston last week, and with those there offered by Stephen C. Phillips and rejected—but both sets were adopted at Dedham— The Liberty party of the 8th. District have nominated Appleton Howe of Weymouth as their Candidate for the 30th. Congress. They nominated him for the 29th.— I have taken a bad cold, and have a return of the sore throat. "

Say unto them, As I live saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?  Ezekiel 33.4—  Throughout this chapter, the idea constantly maintained is that the reward of righteousness, shall be life, and the punishment of wickedness shall be death— The Lord has no pleasure in the death of the wicked. Why will ye die? let the wicked turn from his way and live— But Solomon says in the Book of Ecclesiastes 9.2 that there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, and Jesus exhorts his disciples to be the children of their Father which is in Heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.— Equally certain it is, that the evil and the good—the just and the unjust equally die.— Life and death therefore do not depend upon the righteousness or wickedness of the individual, and the words live and die throughout this chapter must be understood in a figurative and spiritual sense— Nor can I understand it in any other sense than as a promise of future life to the righteous, and a warning of total extinction to the life of the wicked— Why will ye die? The threat of punishment after death—death itself is the penalty—as life is the reward— Not life in this world—but life in the world to come. Life and punishment in the future world was not the doctrine of the Mosaic dispensation but was denounced with emphatic and awful solemnity by Jesus Christ— My health continues to droop, and my hoarseness and sore throat still return— I answered the Letter yesterday received from Mr. James Maguire, and named next Saturday or Monday to receive the Committee from the whig Convention of the 8th congressional District— I wrote also to President Edward Everett, and enclosed the Reports to the Committee of the Overseers—of Professor Peirce, and Mr William C Bond, with the papers annexed to them— Mr Jonathan Wild was here again to enquire concerning the pension  claim of his mother Deborah Wild, but upon which I could still give him no satisfactory information— My chest of Books and Papers ship’d from Washington by the Schooner forest king has arrived but I have not found in it any papers relating to claims nor the printed sheets of the Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States at their late Session which I expected— Mr Wild promised to call once more before I go to Washington, and If I should not in the meantime find the papers I engaged to make search for them at Washington, on my return to the approaching Session— My wife dined and took tea up the hill at Charles’s, and he and his wife were afterwards here. Mr Emmons also paid us an evening visit, and invited me to join a party of a Committee from the City Councils of Boston, to visit George’s and Rainsfords Islands in the harbour to-morrow: which invitation I accepted, without enquiring into its authority.

And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand Ezekiel 37.16.17.  Ezekiel closes the vision of a preceding chapter (20) with an exclamation Then said I, Ah Lord God! They say of me, Doth he not speak parables? which seems to be a remonstrance that the word which came to the prophet was not sufficiently intelligible; and that when he delivered it to the people, they affected not to understand him, and charged him with sporting fables upon them— In the next chapter therefore the same prophesy is pointed expressly at Jerusalem— Almost all the prophesies of the old Testament are parables, and Matthew says 13.34 that all the discourses of Jesus to the multitude, were in parables, and without a parable spake he not unto them— The apostle speaks of this as itself the fulfilment of a prophesy of the utterance of things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world— Is not the secret of eloquence in the parable— This parable of two sticks needed no explanation— It explained itself—immediately following that of the resurrection of dry bones, a figure of surpassing energy.  At half past eight this morning I started in the morning train of the old Colony Railroad from Plymouth to Boston.

Thayer who superintends the works; and Rainsford’s Island which belongs to the city, and where we dined upon Chowder and cold water. We returned to Boston, slowly against wind and tide—landed a quarter past 6 on the long wharf, whence with Mr Beale and Mr Emmons, I repaired to the depot of the old Colony Railroad and we came out in the last daily train of cars to Quincy.

My first visitor this afternoon was Mrs Frost who said she had been twelve years a widow, residing with her father at Littleton in the County of Middlesex in this State—that she had two sons one of whom has already been graduated at Princeton College, New Jersey, and the other has entered this present year at Cambridge. The only reason of her visit to me, she said was the desire to see me— The four succeeding visitors must have been actuated by a similar motive. Miss Pennell residing at Jamaica Plains, and Miss Simson, on a visit to her from Brunswick in the State of Maine— Mr Allen and Mr Morse, as I understood them are inhabitants of Boston. Mr Freeman is a brother of the late Coll. Freeman of the U.S. Marine corps and administrator of his estate— He has a petition before Congress for a claim in this capacity, and came to enquire of its condition— In this as in other cases the want of the Journal of U.S.H.R. leaves me unable to answer his enquiries— All I could say to him was that his petition and that of Mrs Freeman, the Colonel’s widow were both referred at the last Session to the committee on Naval Affairs, of which Isaac E. Holmes of Charleston South Carolina was chairman, and that the Committee made no report; the alternative of which would have been a report against the claim. A part of it however was for pay which John Tyler as P.U.S. had illegally ordered not to be paid— Mr Freeman said he had received this; and I advised that both Mrs Freeman and he should prepare new petitions to be presented at the approaching Session of congress, omitting such portions of the claims as have been already satisfied. This he said they would do; and I promised to take charge of the petitions— My Son received a Letter from John G. Palfrey the Secretary of the Commonwealth—mentioning that Judge Willard Phillips wished to call on me; that he had promised to come with him, and introduce him—and requesting me to fix a time some afternoon of next week to receive them— I desired my son to answer the letter and say, I shall be glad to see them any afternoon of the week, I received also a Letter from Samuel Colman 30.

The visions of Ezekiel are all recorded by himself, speaking in the first person, but whether they were published from time to time as they occurred or were collected together and published at one time is not ascertained by the book itself nor by any of the Commentators that I have at hand— He may be called as Agamemnon in Homer’s Iliad calls Calchas, a prophet of plagues,—for he denounces destruction and ruin to all the Nations upon Earth of which he had any knowledge— But he predicts throughout the restoration to independence and power of his own country which has never yet been realized— Of other nations he foretells the total and final destruction, and that has been fulfilled.

In my answer to Mr James Maguire I named this day as one upon which I should be ready to receive the Committee from the Whig Convention of the 8th. Congregational District of Massachusetts, held at Dedham on the 1st. of this Month, but they did not come, and as often happens after a busy day from 4 in the morning till ten at Night there is nothing left on my memory worthy of being recorded as the action or incident of the day— I received a Letter from my old Correspondent George Joy with triplicate copies of his Letters to Messrs. Hogan and Thompson of 1. August and 3. Septr. 1846— His present Letter to me is dated 19 John Street Pentonville 18 September 1846—and complains that his expectation to hear from me by the Mail of 1. Septr that I had received the copy of his Letter, Pacificus of 1. August to Hogan and Thompson was disappointed, and he fears that his Letter to me enclosing the copy of it has been suppressed, a trick which no mortal could have any possible temptation to practise— He should have received my acknowledgment of the receipt of his Letter and copy if I had written and despatched it as I ought to have done— I answered the Letter of Mr Samuel Colman dated Boston 2. October 1846 requesting an interview with me to talk respecting his desire to obtain the admission of his Son William as a Cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point— I readily agree to the interview, but apprized Mr Colman of the Rules of the War Department respecting the admission of Cadets, which leave the chance of success to the application for his son hopeless. I walked this morning round the railroad square before Sunrise—my exercise for the day. My Son with his wife and daughter were here this evening. "

Daniel 9.25.  This immediately follows the ever memorable prophesy of the seventy weeks which is said to be the reason of the Jews for excluding the book of Daniel from the Canon of their scriptures. But there are four different opinions as to the time indicated by the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem— The first year of Cyrus— The second of Darius: the 7th. and the 20th. of Artaxerxes.— In the earnest desire to give the assent of my own mind to the faith that all the prophesies of the old Testament are predictions of the advent of the Messiah, there is no passage in it more precise and direct than this— The Messiah is styled the Prince a title little suited to the condition in which Jesus Christ appeared upon earth, but still he was the anointed of the Lord—  These three gentlemen came about 11 O’Clock this morning, and informed me that they, together with Lysander Richards of Quincy and J. J. Richards of Weymouth were deputed by the whig Convention of the 8th.

Congress, to inform me that I was chosen by ballot unanimously as the candidate of the party, and to request my acceptance of the nomination. I answered Mr Maguire the chairman of the committee and who spoke in their name, and said that I accepted the nomination with grateful sentiments for the honour done me by the Convention in presenting my name to the people for re-election to the trust which I hold of representing them in Congress, and with equal sensibility to the kindness of the members of the Committee in taking the trouble to make this communication to me in person. I added that I could not but be highly gratified by the unanimity of the Convention, specially manifested by the form of voting by ballot— I regarded it as a decisive testimony of the approbation of my constituents upon the general course of my conduct as their representative, and I made some remarks in commenting upon which my conduct has been subject to some animadversion and censure— The Oregon question and the Mexican War— They expressed their concurrence with my views and after a short conversation took their leave— There are two nominations by Conventions against me Isaac H. Wright, by the Democracy, and Appleton Howe of Weymouth by the Liberty party— The same persons were nominated against me, by the same parties at the election for the present Congress— They may be stronger now— I rode this afternoon with Mrs Charles.

No doubt then says Scott, the resurrection of the dead, the day of judgment and the eternal state of retribution are here predicted; and that shame and everlasting contempt, as well as torment and misery which will be the lot of the wicked— The words are—many of them that sleep in the dust—and in the preceding verse—every one that shall be found written in the book— Immortal life and a state of future retribution as foreshadowed here are attributes not of all mankind—but of many, some righteous and some wicked— Life and immortality to all were brought to light only by the gospel of Jesus Christ—  This morning was fair and the temperature of the atmosphere mild— I walked round the railway square before Sunrise, without pinching of fingers as yesterday and the day before. I had promised Mr Loring of Hingham a visit for a tea-party, at his house, and a ride upon a Nantasket beach; if the weather should be fair.

The prophesies of Hosea, embrace periods from 786 to 723 before Christ—during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeremiah 2d. king of Israel—whose reign continued from 783 to 742 before Christ forty one years— The prophesy of this chapter was delivered in the year 760. and is a prediction of the Assyrian captivity accomplished by Shalmanezer in 721. The declaration applies to the people of the then tribes, personified in the name of Ephraim; sometimes by that of Israel, and often by that of Samaria— After the revolt from the house of David of the ten tribes, and the establishment by Jeroboam the son of Nebat of the kingdom of Israel, its kings dwelt successively at Shechem, at Penuel, at Tirzah and finally in Samaria, purchased by Omri of Shemer, and thenceforward commenced the inextinguishable hatred between the Jews and the Samaritans—  The morning came on again with a clear sky a bright Sun, and my thermometer at the freezing point. Immediately after breakfast Mr Loring of Hingham came in again, on his way to Boston, with his horse and buggy. I had come to the conclusion to postpone for the present Season my annual visit to Hingham, and party at Mr Loring’s house, but he insisted upon another trial, and proposed on his return from Boston this afternoon to take me in his carriage to his house—to have his tea party there to which he said he had invited at least forty persons for the first fair day—that I should pass the night at his house, and go to Boston from Hingham in the New Steamer the May-Flower to-morrow morning, and thence return home by the railway cars— Mr Palfrey had sent me word that he and judge Phillips would visit me this day and I had promised to receive them— To this objection Mr Loring answered that if necessary he would wait till dark, for that visit be over, and I agreed to go with him— They came immediately after we had risen from dinner, and their visit was not of more than half an hour— They were gone, when Mr Loring came and took me up, and we reached his house at the dusk of evening. The tea party soon followed and an evening company of between forty and fifty Ladies and Gentlemen, all of Hingham, and all friends and neighbours of Mr Loring— A very handsome supper of fruit cakes, and confectionary, with lemonade to drink closed the evening: the company dispersed and about 11. O’Clock I retired to my bed. A mingled reflection of self-sufficiency, and of humiliation remained on my mind in the consciousness of disproportion of my part of the conversation. Mr Stearns, the Minister asked my opinion of the right of the United States to the Oregon Territory, which I answered in something like an address at a political canvass upon what in England they call the hustings.

Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent and he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall fall therein.  Hosea 14.9—  Hosea is the first of the 12 minor prophets; and his prophesy is chiefly against Ephraim that is the kingdom of the ten tribes— He predicts the Assyrian captivity and the dispersion of the Samaritans— He threatens Judah also with the indignation of Jehovah—but finishes with a promise of restoration to Israel; and with this last cheering sentiment to the wise and the prudent—  In the English, French, German Bibles the prophesy of Hosea contains 14 chapters, and the Septuagint has the same number— Professor Noyes’s translation is in 16 chapters, but his notes are only upon 14. He assigns no reason for the change in the number of chapters.  I took a single cup of coffee at the party last evening and the consequence was the loss of the whole Night’s sleep— Or rather from 1 to 5 in the morning I was in a state of somnambular sleep, consciously awake and yet insensible to the lapse of time— I heard the clock in a room below strike twelve and one, and then lay fretting at my inability to sleep my senses in forgetfulness; till the dawn came upon me by surprize, and I wondered what had become of the Clock at the hours of 2 3 and 4.— I rose at half past 6. breakfasted at Mr Loring’s, and at half past 7. took passage in the Steam-boat May-Flower for Boston. A new boat which has taken the place of the General Lincoln and plies daily between Hingham and Boston. Mr Loring went in the same boat, and a young Lady by the name of Brown who had been at the party last evening and had lodged at Mr Loring’s. As passengers in the boat, I met also the young painter Hudson, who had painted my portrait last year, and an old gentleman about 60. whom Mr Loring introduced to me by the name of Sohier—William Davies Sohier— I found he was the Son of Edward Sohier a graduate of Harvard University of 1781 six years before me, and a senior practitioner at Law, with me at Boston from 1790. to 1793 when he died after a lingering illness of several months; some time before he died he sent for me, and put into my hands the papers of all his business in the courts which I managed for him till his death— I was one of the pall-bearers at his funeral, and then saw this son of his then a child not more than 6 years of age— I had no recollection of having seen him from that day to this; but he said he had seen me at a later date, at Dr Aaron Dexter’s, whose daughter he married— It must have been in 1807 8 or 9. He has a son named Edward Dexter, a graduate at Harvard University in 1829, and now in good reputation as a practising lawyer—but I do not know him— We landed from the Steamboat, at the wharf behind Pearl-Street about a quarter before 9. and I walked to my Son’s office, where I staid till I was ten minutes too late for the train of cars at half past 9— Then visited Cadmus, judge John Davis, Dr George Parkman, not at home— Came out in the cars at half past 2. and dined at my Son’s up the hill.

IV:10— Fahrenheit 56. at Sunrise— 6.15—  A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. Joel 2.3.  Professor Noyes commences his translation of the Hebrew prophets with the book of Joel— He proposes to substitute a chronological order instead of that in which the Hebrew and the Septuagint concur. But the internal evidence of the book of Joel does not disclose when it was written; and it can scarcely be called a prophesy. It is rather a terrific description of an existing calamity—a plague of Locusts overspreading and desolating the whole land of Judah— The description is awful— The locusts and the mildew are called the great army of the Lord and the picture of the garden of Eden before and the desolation behind startles the imagination to fill up the interval with a volume of the details of destruction.  To make up of the loss of sleep of the night before last I slept last night for the two, and waking only to hear the entry clock strike 4— I then rose and before Sunrise walked round the railway square— The weather was pleasant and almost warm. In the forenoon, Miss Mary A. Baker of Boston came with two numbers 1 and 7. Volume 5 of the Orphans Advocate and Social Monitor, a periodical monthly publication of 8 quarto pages, by Misses A. and E. C. Fellows— It is devoted to the welfare of destitute children, to benevolence and social improvement— These Ladies superintend also an institution, the object of which is to procure places for indigent children, and homes for the houseless. In each of the two papers were two advertisements, one of places in sundry towns of the Commonwealth, offering to take children—mostly girls as members of the family, or to adopt them, and the other of children, boys and girls needing homes— A third advertisement is of donations received, and a fourth the names of travelling agents, four men and four maiden women, of whom Miss Mary A. Baker is one. I gave 3 dollars as a contribution to the cause, but declined subscribing for the paper— I dined again at my Son’s house up the hill— Mrs Charles after dinner took home Miss Rachel Sampson of Braintree, who has been these two weeks working as a Seamstress at the two houses, but who always at the end of each week goes home to pass the Lord’s day under the orthodox spiritual teaching of her own Pastor the Revd. Richard Storrs D.D— About the setting of the Sun MrsSmith came with her husband for the Article which she had requested of me for her contemplated miscellany— I had it not ready—but promised to send her one in the course of the next week—an engagement which I consider as a corvée.

Drizzling N.E storm  Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it? Amos 3.6.  I read this passage in the Book of Amos this morning, and attended public worship at the Temple where Mr Lunt preached morning and afternoon, and in both his discourses suggested reflections and enquiries bearing upon these interrogatories— Shall there be evil in a city and the Lord hath done it? A direct assertion that God is the author of all evil could not so emphatically express the idea as this simple question has done— Thomson translates the corresponding passage in the Septuagint to read “Can there be in a city a calamity which the Lord hath not inflicted?[”] The question whether God is the author of all evil is not quite so salient in this reading as in that of the Hebrew-English Bible. But is as fully included in it— Mr Lunt’s morning text was 1. Timothy 3.16— “And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.[”]— Mr Lunt analysed the enumeration of particulars in respect to which godliness is said to be greatly mysterious, but they appear to have relation exclusively to the person, and divinity of Jesus Christ— The text of the afternoon sermon was James 1.13—[“]Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man 14.— But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed.”— A text which I cannot undertake to reconcile with that of Amos at the top of this page— I only remember reading when I was at the University, the disquisition of Soame Jenyns, on the Origin of evil, whose answer to the objection that his theory makes God the author of evil, is that God must be the author of every thing—  I received a pamphlet printed by J and G. S. Gideon, Washington being the report by Samuel F. Vinton, from the select Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States, at the last Session of Congress upon the charges made by Charles Jared Ingersoll of Official misconduct of Daniel Webster while Secretary of State— The report exonerates Webster from any misdemeanor punishable by Legislative animadversion, but substantiates official transactions not deserving of approbation— The report was laid on the table, and no action was taken upon it by the house—not even an order that it should be printed— This pamphlet must have been published by Webster himself, or some of his friends— Its title is Alleged Official Misconduct of the late Secretary of State—and in addition to the Report, there is an extract from a Speech of Westcott a democrat Senator from Florida, to bolster up the tarnished reputation of Webster; whose private character is notoriously loose in morals and of intemperate habits, both of the table and bed chamber— Less odious however than the vices of his accuser.

And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them. 15. And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land, which I have given them, saith the Lord thy God.  Amos 9–14–15—  Amos was a common Shepherd, among the herdmen of Tekoa, and he was charged by Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, with conspiracy against Jeroboam the second king of Israel. Amaziah denied the right of Amos to prophesy against the king of Israel, because he was a subject of the king of Judah, and he ordered Amos to flee away into the land of Judah, and eat bread and prophesy there— Amos replies that he was no prophet nor a prophet’s son—but an herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit—or as Charles Thomson translates the Septuagint—of dates— And the Lord took him as he followed the flock and said unto him, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel— Then he turns upon the priest of Bethel and in defiance of his prohibition, and predicts horrible destruction to him and his whole family—and also the captivity of Israel— And short as the Book of Amos is, consisting of only 9 chapters, he prophesies not only against Israel and Judah, but ruin and destruction to all the neighbouring Nations around them—Damascus, Gaza and the Philistines, Tyre—the Ammonites and the Moabites—he denounces one common ruin against them all—closing however with this glorious restoration of the people of Israel; promising that among other blessings reserved for them they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof  My thermometer this morning was nearly but not quite down to the freezing point and I returned from the walk round the railway square with fingers too much pinched for writing. My wife went to Boston with Mrs Charles, and after their return remained and dined with them up the hill— I found an old paper of Watt’s powders for copying paper ink, and made a pint of it according to the directions with the exception that I made a full pint with the two papers which they describe as sufficient for one third of a pint, and that instead of one tea spoonful of French Brandy to guard the ink from moulding I put in about 2 table spoonfuls of wild cherry rum. I have had the papers of powder from the time when I was in London in 1796. just 50 years— They were hardened into cakes, but melted in the boiling water into ink as black as they could have done when perfectly fresh— I received this day by the mail the Liberty Almanac for 1847. published at New York by William Harned.— Also Wiley and Putnam’s Literary News-Letter for October Vol 5.

Fahrenheit 26 at Sunrise 6.20— White frost— Aurora Borealis  Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down saith the Lord.  Obadiah 1.4.  Then said the Lord, thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: 11. And should not I spare Niniveh, that great city, wherein are more than six-score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand: and also much cattle  Jonah 4.10.11—  The vision of Obadiah is in a single chapter— It is a prophesy of the destruction of the kingdom of Edom, by a league of the two kingdoms of Jacob, that is of Judah and of Joseph, that is of the ten tribes against it— The names of the two kingdoms of Hebrews here are Jacob and Joseph— The names most commonly given them, by the prophets are Judah and Ephraim— Israel is often substituted for Ephraim and after the captivity, passes generally by the name of Samaria— Ezekiel personifies them by the names of Aholah and Aholibah— A strict attention to all this variety of names is indispensable to avoid utter confusion in reading the prophets, and even informing a strict idea of the sacred history— This vision portending nothing more than the total destruction of the Edomites, is said to have been published precisely at the time of the dissolution of the Kingdom of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian captivity— Who Obadiah was, does not appear— Nothing is known of him, except this record of his vision— But the book of Jonah I suppose to be an allegorical parable—a popular tale invented to illustrate the doctrine that God almighty may be propitiated by repentance and prayer to revoke his own sentence of destruction against a guilty city so as apparently to falsify the prediction of a true prophet— Jonas is a true prophet but his prediction fails to be realized by the discharge of God’s purpose— The disappointment of the prophet by the failure of his prediction drives him to desperation, but his exultation at the growth of the gourd, which shelters him from the heat of the Sun, and his despondency at the withering of the gourd by the visitation of the worm lead only to the antithetical argument of Jehovah that Jonah was wrong in complaining that his prophesy had been falsified by God’s failing to execute his own determination, because it was done in tender mercy to repentance and prayer, and because he himself having felt compassion for a perishing vegetable, could not charge God with inconsistency for sparing from threatened destruction a city of 600000 people—  Notwithstanding the winter cold of the thermometer I walked round the Railroad square before Sunrise to the sharp pinching of my fingers— I was very busy the whole day without interruption of visitors without being able even to bring up the arrears of the last two days in this Journal. I waste too much reading on the newspapers which leave no recollection behind. "

But in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. 2. And many Nations shall come and say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 3. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. Micah 4.1.2.3.—and Isaiah. 2.2.3.4.  I hope it may not be presumptuous to remark that as understood by the Jews and by Christians of all denominations this is the distinct and explicit promise of the Messiah and of his kingdom on earth— Its repetition in the same words by two of the prophets may have crept into the manuscripts, but the additional verse in Micah—4. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree: and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it, is the most delightful incident of the whole prediction— The cessation of war between the Nations of the earth will be an improvement in the condition of man by perpetual exemption from the greatest of evils— The setting under his vine and his fig-tree with none to make him afraid is improvement of his condition by the enjoyment of blessings never secured to him while he will be exposed to suffer the calamities of War.  I still fail to redeem the arrears of my daily record. My morning walk round the Railway square is the only occurrence of sufficient moment to be noted in my diurnal movements— Passed Midshipman John Quincy Adams was here before dinner— And Mr Augustus Young heretofore a member of Congress from the State of Vermont, and a theoretic assailant of Sir Isaac Newton’s system of the Universe, came and brought with him his 8vo volume of 292 pages, now at length just published and entitled Unity of purpose or Rational Analysis, being a Treatise designed to disclose physical truths and to detect and expose popular errors— This title page does not disclose who is the author of these popular errors: but they are the supposed discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton and especially his theory of gravitation— I had subscribed for this book when Mr Young began to prepare it for publication— He communicated to me then the outlines of his system, and asked my opinion of it. I told him I was not sufficiently conversant with the subject to give or to form an opinion between the conflicting elements of his system and that of Sir Isaac Newton, but I would take a copy of his book, and endeavour to understand it as well as I can. He left a copy with me for which he took two dollars— Its proper price would be about half a dollar— Charles and his wife were here this Evening. Mrs John was confined to her chamber with a cold and sore throat— "

Crystal clear—  He hath shewed thee, O Man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?  Micah 6.8.  This is one of the remarkable passages of the old Testament, placing in contrast with each other the efficacy of sacrifices, and of moral virtue to propitiate the favour of Almighty God— The aspirant enquires by what sacrifice, even the most costly, nay of his own first born Son, he can obtain the blessing of Jehovah? The answer says nothing of sacrifice, but declares that he has been shewn by God himself what is good: and for the enjoyment of it, nothing is required of him but justice, mercy and sincere humility—to walk humbly with his God— There is no rejection of sacrifice not even a word of displeasure at the extension of the question to the sacrifice of a first born Son. The question with regard to sacrifice is left unanswered or rather left to the inference that from the just, the merciful and the humble no sacrifice is required— The whole system of the Mosaic law was founded upon the efficacy of sacrifice as atonement for sin— It was abolished by Jesus Christ himself in the Christian creed a voluntary sacrifice in atonement for the sins of all mankind—  Just after eleven O’Clock last Night about an hour after we had retired to bed my granddaughter Mary Louisa came into our bed chamber and requested my wife to go in to her mother who she said was not very well— My wife immediately rose and went into Mrs John Adams’s chamber, and remained with her the whole Night— It was an attack of Croup or Quinsy— Dr Woodward was immediately sent for and came about midnight and administered the remedy which relieved her from the pressing danger— I passed the Night sleepless, and in agony, but arose upon the stroke of four by the Clock— Al was still in the house and as d— as day-light came I walked round the railway square— At the corner of my Son’s house I saw the Sun rise in all his beauty and splendour with a frost of four degrees pinching my fingers— Mrs Charles who heard me threw up her window, and enquired, what of the night, at the house below I told her how ill Mary had been—she rose immediately and came down to our house and breakfasted with us— The crisis with Mary had passed away and she was left with an ordinary hoarseness and sore throat. I went to Boston with Mrs Charles and her little Mary in the Carriage—was shaved at Cadmus’s shop, called on judge John Davis and had an hour of pleasant conversation with him— Then at my son’s office and at one met Mrs Charles at Dr Frothinghams and we returned to Quincy— I found Mr John Martin Connell at dinner with my family. He returned to Boston and I dined at my Son’s. "

Wo unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness— Habakkuk 2.15—  On the 6th. of September 1840. passing the day at Kentville in the British province of Nova Scotia I heard the Revd. H. L. Owen a clergyman of the church of England, preach at Cornwallis, a temperance sermon from this text— I then remarked, the gross blunders of grammar, in this text as it reads in the common English bible— In Charles Thomson’s version of the Septuagint—it reads “Wo to him who maketh his neighbour drink a foamy intoxicating draught, making him drunk that he may inspect his caves”— This is grammar, but a prodigious abatement of the picturesque in the conveyance of the thought—the transition from the third to the second person to him that puttest thy bottle is a flagrant breach of grammar—but brings the charge of tempting drunkenness directly to the reader—and observe the difference of the tempter’s motive—in the Septuagint merely to inspect their caves, in the common bible, to look on their nakedness—the transition from the singular to the plural also their nakedness implying that in making one man drunk you tempt a whole company adds aggravation to the charge. It is a curious reflection for a student of composition, that this setting at defiance all the rules of grammar snatches a grace beyond the reach of art and constitutes the beauty of the Style.

Professor Noyes who undertakes to give them in Chronological order begins with Joel and follows up with Amos, Hosea, Isaiah and Micah—but he acknowledges that the time when several of the prophets wrote is altogether uncertain— The date of the prophecy of Zephaniah on the margin of the English Bible is 612 before Christ—two years before king Josiah was slain by Pharaoh Necho—cotemporary with the 4th. 5th. and 6th. chapters of Jeremiah—  Mr Lunt preached in the Temple this morning from John 21.22— Jesus saith unto him, if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow then me— This is the text upon which all the fables about the wandering Jew have been constructed— The brethren, that is the disciples of Jesus at the time understood him as declaring that the beloved disciple John should not die— The evangelist himself says that Jesus did not say that he should not die, but from what he did say, the brethren could draw no other conclusion, and there are thousands upon thousands upon the roll of Christians at this day who believe that the apostle is yet living and walking the world without being known— It opens a field for the exercise of imagination, in the invention of facts irresistible to the herd of novelists and Romancers of the present age; but the great stress of Mr Lunt’s discourse was upon the query—what is that to thee? and upon the final injunction follow then me.— He expatiated with great eloquence upon this command which he understood as addressed to all the disciples of all ages, and of every nation—and he enumerated many particulars in which he held it the duty of all Christians to follow their Lord and master, and to hearken throughout their lives to his voice addressing them in the words which he spoke to the Apostle Peter, what is that to thee? follow thou me— Mr Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from 1. Corinthians 12.21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you— I had heard him preach this sermon before, but it is the old fable of Menenius Agrippa.

There is a Sermon of Archbishop Tillotson, upon this and the three preceding verses. (Sermon 70. vol. 4. p. 256.) which I read many years ago with much satisfaction, and in which he explains this prophesy by maintaining that the greater glory of the second Temple, to consist in the presence of the Messias that is that it was the place in which he revealed himself to the world— This is not directly said by the prophet, nor was it possible for those to whom the prophesy was addressed to form a conception that this was its meaning, but the object of the prophet was to stimulate and urge his countrymen to great exertions to complete rebuilding of the temple, and an indefinite promise of greater glory reserved for the second Temple, than that of Solomon had enjoyed was well suited to kindle into enthusiasm the zeal of the builders to accomplish the work— The advent of the Messiah was foreshadowed in this prophesy, as distinctly as it had been before by Isaiah.  I have been watching every clear morning these three weeks to witness the rising of Arcturus in the East, and saw him for the first time about 10 minutes risen this morning— Orion, Sirius Procyon were shining at the South and Calisto and Helice at the North, and at half past 5 Venus made her appearance in the morning twilight approaching to her conjunction with the Sun— The thermometer at 24 degrees was 2 degrees lower than it had before been this Season, and I sallied forth no farther than to witness the rising of the Sun from the corner of my Son’s house— I pass most of my time in self reproach for doing nothing—though I labour heavily at reading the Scriptures and the Newspapers, and at keeping up with the current of time in this journal— I received this day the Liberty Bell of 1842.— Of 1844 with an engraved portrait of Lucretia Mott, and of 1845 with an etching profile of Wendell Phillips.

Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lovely and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.  Zechariah— 9.9.  In the 21st chapter of Matthew it is related that Jesus sent two of his disciples to fetch him an Ass with a colt for him to ride into Jerusalem, which he did followed by a multitude shouting hozannas to him as the Messiah; and the evangelist says v. 4. All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying 5. Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass— The name of the prophet is not mentioned by the evangelist, but the quotation is in words so nearly identical with this prediction of Zechariah, that it can refer to no other— But in comparing the prophesies of the Old Testament with the references to them in the New, questions constantly occur, why incidents so trivial in themselves should be made so prominent in prophesy, so obscure when delivered, and so insignificant when fulfilled— When Jesus sent for an ass with a colt to ride into Jerusalem, he had express reference to this prophesy, and the special purpose to fulfil it, but he did not disclose his purpose to his disciples— But the prophesy was that the king should come riding upon an Ass, that he should be just, and lowly and should bring with him salvation. The Ass with retrospect to the prophesy was equivalent to the assumption of the kingly crown, and so it was understood by the multitude, who hailed it with rapture, and by the Priests and Pharisees who considered it as a compound crime of Treason and blasphemy— But why should this incident be made a subject of prophesy?— If merely emblematical of the humility of the Saviour, it opened no prospect of future justice or promise of Salvation—  Mr Joab Seely, styling himself an inhabitant of Vermont came as a mendicant agent in behalf of the Oberlin college in the State of Ohio— He had no credential of authority from the college itself.

And he shall turn the heart of the father to the children, and the heart of the children to their father, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. Malachi 4–5.6.  These are the closing verses of the old Testament, which I began to read on the first day of last December and finished this morning— I began with reading two chapters every morning which I increased successively to three and four. And for the purpose of fixing my attention more closely to what I read I have adopted the practice of entering upon this daily journal one or more verses of each days reading. Since I reached home on the 15th. of August I have read every morning the corresponding chapters of Charles Thomson version of the Septuagint, and consulted daily the Notes of Hewlett and of Scott, and sometimes the French Bible of Ostervald, and the German Bible of Luther— My proficiency in Bible learning bears no proportion to the time and study that I bestow upon it— So many times as I have read the bible through I am surprized at the multitude of passages that I had either never noticed or have totally forgotten that I ever had noticed them before.— The only ultimate purpose of reading the Bible is for religious and moral instruction— Its history, its Chronology, its biography and its geography are not more difficult to understand than those of a profane historian, but the more I read the prophetical books, the more I find my understanding perplexed with them— Christians of all denominations consider them all as predictions of the advent of the Messiah; and most of the readers of the English Language consider Pope’s Pastoral as containing the sum and substance of them all.  I have nothing to tell of the incidents of this day— With incessant labour morning and evening I brought up the arrears of journal— I answered the Letter from Mrs Eliza T. P. Smith of Woodvale Roxbury, and enclosed with it the Ode on Justice, which I wrote in England in 1816. and which has never been published— I offer it for publication in her miscellany— There is a sentiment of the ridiculous connected with this multitude of applications, for lectures, and autographs, and lines for Albums from which I cannot escape— Above all are such requests embarrassing yet flattering—from females— Mrs Chapmans call for a chime on the Liberty bell is now on hand, and I have nothing better to contribute than extracts from the fragment of an epistle to the Clio of the National House of Representatives.

Esdras 3.10–11–12  I began the reading of the Apocrypha. four chapters a day. And still extract from them one verse more, to introduce the daily Diary— I begin with the curious discussion between the officers of the guards of king Darius of the question of the relative strength of Wine, the King, women and Truth, which led to the rebuilding of the Temple of Jerusalem— This event has an important and indispensable connection with the advent, and history of the Messiah; although it is not easy to perceive why the restoration of the temple should have been necessary to introduce the founder of a system of religion which was to supersede the temple and all its modes of worship and all its sacrifices— There is not the most distant allusion to this in any one of the prophets— Under the doctrines of the Law from Sinai, there was but one lawful place for the worship of Jehovah, and from the days of David that was Jerusalem, to which he had brought the ark of the covenant— The restoration apparently promised by all the prophets was that Jerusalem should again be the only place of worship, not only for the children of Israel, but for all Nations— And that the priesthood, and the worship of sacrifice should be restored as well as the Temple.—  I went to Boston this morning in the train cars which left the depot of Quincy at half past ten— On alighting at Boston I walked first to my Son’s office where I saw Mrs Beck of Charlestown, who has a petition and a claim before Congress, the condition of which I could not inform her—but which I must not forget at Washington next December— At noon I attended the meeting of the Massachusetts historical Society— There were 22 members present, but no business of importance transacted— The meeting adjourned soon after 1. I dined with Judge John Davis. His two widow daughters, Mrs Goodwin and Mrs Plympton two of his grandsons, children of his deceased son John Watson, the Revd. Doctor John Codman of Dorchester and Daniel Appleton White, judge of probate for the County of Essex, constituted the party— After dinner about 4, I called on the Revd. Dr Frothingham, and had a short conversation with him— I asked him the meaning of the word Huzzab Nahum 2–7. which he could not tell me, but he found in Richardson’s Dictionary the word tabering and many old authorities for its use—smiting as upon a tabor. I came home in the train of Cars which left Boston at half past 4 and got home at 5. Met in the Cars the Revd.

Esdras. 6.1.  There is another chronological table very desirable, of the prophets and prophesies during the same period, in which accuracy is not attainable— The order in which the prophets are published in all the Bibles is absurd and unaccountable.

Congress of the United states— This schism of the whig party occasioned by Winthrop’s vote for the declaration of War against Mexico—will go far to overthrow the political ascendancy of the whigs in this Commonwealth— The moral issue upon the question of the War is precisely that between Brutus and Cassius in the Shakespear’s Tragedy of Julius Caesar— It is the question between the Epicurean and the Stoic philosophy— It is a severe trial upon the worldly prospects of my Son, who in this case has taken the side of Right, of Justice and of Truth, and for whom I can only implore of the giver of all good, that his strength corporeal, moral, and intellectual may prove equal to this and to every other trial through which he may be called to pass— I walked round the railway square this morning before breakfast and stop’d at Marsh the shoemaker’s, and ordered a pair of slipper shoes.

Esdras 1.4–5  On the 30th. of September 1845. I was compelled to desist from the practice which I had maintained with some four intervals of exception for more than half a century of keeping in my own hand a daily journal of the incidents of my life— Unwilling to give it up entirely, I continued with the assistance of my two daughters, and especially of my grand daughter Mary Louisa, through the last winter, and until the close of the Session of Congress on the 10th. of August— As the Summer came on I recovered partially the use of my right hand, and with untiring labour have brought up my Diary to this day— But I have lost again the command of my right hand and cannot hope to recover it again— I have but a few days more to live, and the record of that remnant can be of little interest even to my Son, and to those of my family whom I am about to leave behind— There has perhaps not been another individual of the human race of whose daily existence from early childhood to four score years has been noted down with his own hand so minutely as mine— At little more than twelve years of age I began to journalize, and nearly two years before that on the 11th. of February 1778. I embarked from my maternal uncle, Norton Quincy’s house at Mount Wollaston on board the Boston Frigate Captain Samuel Tucker then lying in Nantasket roads, and bound to France— I was then ten years and seven months old, and the house whence I embarked had been built by my great grandfather John Quincy—upon his marriage with Elizabeth Norton in 1716. There he lived to the age of 77 years, and there he died on the 13th. of July 1767—the day after I had received his name in baptism— If my intellectual powers had been such as have sometimes committed by the creator of man to single individuals of the species my diary would have been next to the holy scriptures the most precious and valuable book ever written by human hands, and I should have been one of the greatest benefactors of my Country and of mankind— I would by the irresistible power of Genius, and the inexpressible energy of will and the favour of almighty God, have banished War and Slavery from the face of the earth forever—but the conceptive power of mind was not conferred upon me by maker, and I have not improved the scanty portion of his gifts as I might and ought to have done. May I never cease to be grateful for the numberless blessings received through life at his hands—never repine at what he has denied—never murmur at the dispensations of his Providence, and implore his forgiveness for all the errors and delinquencies of my life— "

This passage of the second Apocryphal book of Esdras carries with it internal evidence of its composition since the advent of Christ.  The influenza, better denominated in the French language La grippe has recently become epidemic in this neigbourhood—and has severely exercised several members of my family— It has the last three days been gradually creeping upon me, and at 10 last night I went to bed with a hoarse voice, and a burning sore throat— About one this morning it had become so intense that I was compelled to request my wife to rise and get for me some hot balm tea which she did and sat up with me the whole night, to the imminent danger of her own health. The severity of the stricture upon the throat passed off before morning day-light, and I rose at half past five I rose much relieved but still hoarse, and with the paretytic shaking of the hands totally disabled for writing— I can yet read, and did read four chapters of the second book of Esdras, and took comfort from the verse which I have made out to extract from it at the top of this page— The hope of a future life is the only solace for the infirmities of age, and for all the ills that flesh is heir to, as I am to the condition of an aspen leaf—  I attended meeting as usual morning and afternoon at the Temple. Mr Lunt preached in the forenoon from Galatians 5.6 [“]For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love”— The whole sum of the Christian Religion is contained in this text— Circumcision was a religious painful and bloody operation upon the body of every male child first instituted by Abraham under the express command of God, for himself and all his descendants but for which no reason was assigned, except that of distinguish them from all the rest of mankind— It was emblematic of nothing but submission against the cry of physical nature itself to the will of God— It is practiced by the posterity of Abraham to the present day— It was abolished not by express command of Jesus Christ, but by the substitution of the rite of baptism in its place, an emblem, of purification from the pollution of nature, and of washing away every impurity from a body born in the image of God, and bound in sympathy to all mankind and to hold a Faith working by love— In the afternoon the Revd. Lemuel Capen  of South Boston, preached from Romans 15.4. a panegyric upon the Scriptures of the old Testament. Mr Capen took tea with us, as also did Mr. Degrand who came out this afternoon from Boston. "

There is a marked difference between the canonical books of the Bible and the Apocryphal writings in this— I have never met with any difficulty in selecting from four chapters of the old Testament every morning one verse to be copied for the lesson of the day. In these books of Esdras, a sentiment worthy to be imprinted upon the memory and the heart is not always to be found in the compass of four chapters—unless as in the above passage connected with other verbiage which takes away all the point of sententiousness—  I thought myself all day yesterday wholly relieved from the grippe upon my throat—but after going to bed last night, a return in mitigated form of the threatened visit from quinsy—disturbed though it did not entirely destroy my repose— I had sleep but not quiet— Once in the middle of the Night, my wife rose from bed to give me a second cup of warm balm tea, and I dined rise for the day till the entry Clock struck six— The hoarseness had again very much subsided and the sore throat wholly disappeared— My regular course of occupation is broken up, and idleness is the doom of my remaining days by the refusal of my hands to perform the task of recording my daily thoughts and deeds— We had a visit from Miss Susan Tufts of Weymouth this afternoon, and I had a professional visit from Dr Woodward— He prescribed for me a warm foot bath before going to bed this evening—and a tea spoonful of the syrup of Tolu, to be repeated in the course of the Night— He directed me also to wash my legs every morning with a mixture of New-England rum and water— Among my symptoms of decay, is a constant heat and irritation in the outer side of my legs below the calf which I have suffered for the last eighteen months with a discolouring of the parts and feverish heat portending ulceration, and a swelling round the ancles at night whenever I walked in the course of the day. The swelling and the heat generally subsiding in the course of the Night Throughout last winter they were washed with milk and water every night before going to bed, but as the Summer came on the complaint subsided and the fomentation was omitted— With the reapproach of cold weather the complaint has now returned and I am to resort to rum instead of milk to mingle with water for the wash— I received a Letter from Georgiana Cutter of Quincy Illinois 16.

Dr Woodward’s warm foot bath, and his two teaspoon fulls of Syrup of Tolu were succeeded by a quiet night, and sleep till near six this morning when I rose— Besides my usual frictions and ablutions, I washed my legs with New England rum and water, mixed about half and half— The teazing titillation with which they are unceasingly tormented was less annoying through the day than it has been for months, but I may not hope for a long respite from this remedy. The mildness of the weather doubtless contributed to my momentary relief— My sore throat is gone— The hoarseness of my voice much mollified—but the shaking hand cannot be made steady and my efforts to write are vain— We had a morning visit from Ex President Quincy—who has removed to Boston for the Winter, but still lingers about the Quincy hive— And I received a letter from his Son Edmund Quincy—Dedham 2.

These are all considered by the author as the enduring records of the antiquity of the globe— As the medals and the vestiges of creation, by which its pre human history is read, and which attest the rise and fall of kingdoms animal, before the existence of Man— This is a hasty and unwarranted conclusion— The existence of a race of Giants is expressly recognized in holy writ—but not before the creation of man— "

This is good advice— The two books of Esdras are not either in my French or my German Bible— They were not admitted into the Canon of Scripture at the Council of Trent, and are not considered as Canonical by the Church of Rome. The books canonized by the Council of Trent are Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and first and second Maccabes—and Baruch, annexing it to Jeremiah— The sixth of the 39 Articles of the Church of England after declaring canonical 38 books of the old Testament, says “and the other books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example of life, and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply there to establish any doctrine: these are the first and second, called the third and fourth Books of Esdras, Tobias, Judith, the rest of the Book of Hester, Wisdom, Jesus the son of Sirach, Baruch the prophet, The Song of the three children, The story of Susanna, Of Bel and the Dragon, The Prayer of Manassas, and the first and second book of Maccabees[”]— The Protestant churches in general, save the church of England deny all authority whatever to all the apocryphal books, and they are never read in any of the congregational churches of New England— I once heard Dr Frothingham however, take a text from one of them—auxiliary to another text from the New Testament— I read them in company with the true Bible, but with a different feeling for their -structions than for those of the canonical books The Book of Jesus the Son of Sirach, Ecclesiasticus; is the only one of the collection upon which I set much value, and that is inestimable— The Count de Maistre at Saint Petersbourg spoke to me in rapturous terms of the Wisdom of Solomon, and I have often heard it highly prized by others— There are in it many good sentiments in it but I do not concur in the judgment which dignifies it with the name of Solomon. The books of the Maccabees, are readable only as historical narratives, and as such are exceedingly confused— This book of Tobit is a sort of fairy tale, remarkable chiefly as an interesting picture of domestic life and of the family affections among the Jews, and of their attachment to their religion during the Assyrian captivity.

In the fourth Book of Milton’s Paradise there is introduced a very strange comparison founded upon this passage of the book of Tobit.— After an enchanting description of the beauties of Paradise, and especially of the fragrance of its flowers, as enjoyed by Satan upon his approach to the garden of Eden, on his mischievous mission from Pandemonium, to express the delight administered to the senses of the fallen angel by these balmy essences he compares them to the exquisite perfumes of Araby the blest, pervading the atmosphere far out at Sea, and breathed by Navigators round the Cape of Hope, he adds  Paradise Lost 4.166.  What a transition from the sublime to the ridiculous.  The Revd. Mr Connell paid us again an afternoon visit— I have formed from this slight acquaintance a very favourable opinion of his character— I invited him to stay and pass the night with us, but he declined— I went with him to the Rail-road depot for the train of 5. p.m. and met there my Son going in to the independent rally meeting of the whigs who have nominated Dr Howe as a candidate for Congress in opposition to Robert C. Winthrop— As the Cars departed I went to my Son’s house where I found Edmund Quincy there— The Norfolk County Anti-Slavery Meeting had been held, at the Lyceum Hall under the Town house and had adjourned to half past seven this evening— We staid with Mr Charles till after tea—and I went with Mr Quincy to the Lyceum Hall where the Anti-Slavery Society were reassembled— Wendell Phillips was addressing them in an eloquent speech— He spoke for upwards of an hour longer; and was followed for about another hour by Edmund Quincy—and him followed Parker Pilsbury an Orator with whom I had not been before acquainted— The question was then taken upon certain Resolutions which had been offered and they were adopted with one dissenting voice, but they were not read— The meeting was then adjourned without day— The Lyceum Hall was well filled with an attentive auditory, more than half of which were women. I walked home, Mrs Charles was gone up the hill. She got home about 11. "

It is better to give alms than to lay up gold— Tobit 12.8.  Prayer, fasting, alms—righteousness—constitute the moral code of the Apocryphal books— Tobit and his family were of the tribe of Naphthali, one of the ten, and consequently of the Assyrian Captivity. He lived at Ninive, and his family and tribe fell into idolatry, and sacrificed unto the heifer Baal—but Tobit himself adhered to the exclusive worship at Jerusalem— The marriage of his son Tobias with Sara, daughter of Raguel who dwelt at Ecbatana, a city of Media, was contracted conformably to the Levitical law, like that of Boaz with Ruth, as the nearest of kin— And Tobit had committed ten Talents in deposit to Gabael, in Rages, another city of Media. By a marvelous accident he had become blind and Sara was bewitched by an evil Spirit named Asmodeus who had fallen in love with her, and had killed seven husbands to whom she had been successively been betrothed on their respective wedding nights— So Tobit prays at Ninive for restoration of his sight, and Sara prays at Ecbatana, for deliverance from the witchery of Asmodeus—and Raphael was sent to heal them both—to scale away the whiteness of Tobit’s eyes, and to give Sara for a wife to Tobias and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit—all which he performs— Tobit lives after all this nearly a hundred years at Ninive— Towards the close of his life he called his son Tobias and strictly enjoined upon him and his six Sons to remove from Ninive to Ecbatana in Media, because the prophesy of Jonas against Ninive should surely come to pass and Ninive should be destroyed— Tobit seems not to have known that when Jonah did prophesy the destruction of Ninive, it was to be consummated within 40 days; but that the people of Ninive repented of their Sins, and God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them: and he did it not the prophesy was never fulfilled; to the great affliction and indignation of the prophet himself—  I had morning calls successively from Revd. E. Whitney corresponding Secretary of a Boston Society for the promotion of moral reform, for which he solited a contribution— He had a duodecimo volume entitled the Sabbath, by Revd. A. A. Phelps. 3d. Edition 1844. I took the book for half a dollar, but declined the contribution—and from Revd. Austin Dickinson, with written recommendations from Theodore Frelinghuysen at New-York in May and Samuel Hubbard at Boston in July— He too solicited a contribution for him to circulate religious articles in the popular Newspapers, which I declined— In the afternoon I had visits from Dr Duggan and E. G. Robinson, publisher of the Norfolk County Democrat. "

Tobit 14.15—  In the book of Jonah, God says there were in the City of Ninive six score thousand persons who knew not their right hand from their left, importing a population of a million—besides much cattle— He says this in answer to the reproach of Jonah, for his forbearance to execute the threat of destruction which Jonah by his command had announced to the inhabitants of that city— The multitude of human beings who must suffer by the destruction of such a city besides other living animals is presented as a motive for the Lord to revoke his own decree against the devoted victim of his anger, and shews in bold relief the absurd inconsistency of the prophet who had bowels of compassion for a withering vegetable, and none for the city of Ninive— Here the book of Jonah closes, and leaves a delightful sentiment for the memory to impress upon the heart— The close of the book of Tobit has an effect directly the reverse upon mine— Tobias lives to hear of the destruction of Ninive, and rejoices over it— Here is the Spirit of Jonah, and not the Spirit of God—  I walked round the Railway square, but the sight of the rising Sun was intercepted by clouds and the railway bridge was powdered with white frost— My wife went into Boston with Mrs Charles to prepare her town house and Mary Louisa for a riding lesson— They returned home to dine— My brother Charles’s daughter, widow Susan Boylston Treadway resides at Richmond Virginia with her only daughter Susan, wife of Adoniram Judson Crane, a lawyer in that city.

They ask my opinion of the constitutionality of that act, and also as to the probability of success if they should bring the subject before the Supreme Court— I have no doubt that the act is unconstitutional, but I have no confidence in the success of an appeal to the Supreme Court— The balance of Justice in that tribunal is loaded with the weight of Slavery— "

And in the eighteenth year, the two and twentieth day of the first month, there was talk in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, that he should, as he said, avenge himself on all the earth.  Judith 2.1.  This Nabuchodonosor, called in the Hebrew Bible Nebuchadnezzar, and Nebuchadrezzar, is not known by that name in prophane history—nor is the person named Nabuchodonosor in this book of Judith the same with the one who put out the eyes of Zedekiah and extinguished the kingdom of Judah by the Babylonian captivity— The heathen name of this Nabuchodonosor was Saosduchinus—his Capitol was Niniveh, and what or where this Bethulia was, which his General Holofernes was besieging when Judith delivered her country and the world from him in this wonderful manner no one knows— The name of the dreamer Nabuchodonosor whose dreams Daniel discovered and expounded was Nabopolassar, and he was the father of Nebuchadnezzar the great— I cannot disentangle the snarl.  Mr Lunt preached this morning at the Temple, from Acts 1.8. the last clause of the verse—“and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” He omitted the first clause—“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.” These were the last words spoken by Jesus to his apostles, after his passion, on mount Olivet— They consist first of the promise of power, by the outpouring of the holy Ghost—and 2. of the instruction to go and preach as his witnesses, throughout the earth— Mr Lunt did not remark upon the grant of power nor upon the promise of the holy Ghost; but confined his discourse to the character of witnesses, which was conferred upon the apostles— The greek word is martyrs—ye shall be martyrs unto me.— The occurrence, and the last words of Jesus are related somewhat differently, in the last three verses of the gospel of Matthew—but the drift of Mr Lunt’s discourse was upon the import of the word witnesses applicable only to facts— His argument was that the truth of the Christian Religion depended not upon the nature of its doctrine, nor upon the faith or belief of its followers, but upon the facts of its history of which the apostles could be preachers to the world, efficient only so far as they were faithful witnesses to facts— Mr Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from James 1.19—[“]Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath” an admirable lesson of practical morality; from which he took occasion to bear testimony against Slavery, and to express the hope that no Slaveholder would ever hereafter be elected the chief magistracy of this Union— This doctrine is not yet sufficiently palatable even for this climate— Charles and his wife spent the evening here— "

George Newcomb chairman was chosen, to consider if the town will undertake to erect the building for an Academy or Classical School as proposed in my fathers donation to the town; and also provide an apartment in the Town-house for the Library which still remains in my farm house— The Committee are to procure a plan for the building and estimates of the cost of erecting it, and report the same to the town at a meeting to be called for that purpose. Mr Thomas Greenleaf President of the Supervisors of the Temple and School fund, returning from the Town hall, called, and informed me of these votes. I met Mr George Newcomb at the Hall and he came this afternoon to my house—and we agreed that the Committee should procure a plan for the school house and estimates of the cost and he should concert with Mr Greenleaf for a meeting of the Committee and the Supervisors of the time of which he will give me notice.

This Letter requires a cool, deliberate and unequivocal answer, and one which unassisted I cannot give— I believe it however my duty to make the attempt and my time is now so short, and my labour so slow, that I almost despair of effecting it— This journal absorbs the whole of my time in the struggle to continue the record of a daily page which I have more than once renounced as utterly impracticable— I have also become entangled in researches of Bible Chronology— The English Universal History begins with the Chronology of the book of Genesis from the creation to the birth of Abraham—and commences the general history of the world with Egypt— Rollin commences with the Assyrians, Lydians, Medes, Persians and Greeks— I consult the Tablettes Chronologiques of Lenglet Dufresnoy— The tables in the 20th. volume of the French Dictionaire Historique 9th. edition 1812— Josephus, Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and find no end, in wandering mazes lost— I have received a Letter from Mrs Rebeca Boylston Drury 6.

And if a man love righteousness, her labours are virtues; for she teacheth temperance, and prudence, justice and fortitude; which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in their life.  Wisdom of Solomon 8.7.  Here is another admirable sentiment, but which did not originate with Solomon— It comes from the moral philosophy of the Grecian Schools— I wasted hours this day in searching to trace it to its source, with no better success than to find them named in Cicero’s Treatise de Inventione 2.53. I believe the word Virtue is not once used in the Old Testament— In the new Testament it is used in two very different senses—1. Mark 5.30 and Luke 6.19. where the diseased were healed by touching the hem of the garment of Jesus, and it is said virtue went out of him; but in both these instances the word in the Greek Testament is δύναμις—power—and 2.2. Peter 1.3 and 5 where the word in the Greek Testament is ἀρετῆ— The word virtus in Latin, and by its derivation means manhood, because, as Cicero says Fortitude is one of the properties of man and being the chief Virtues is taken to include them all under the name of virtus—manhood— In Johnson’s dictionary there are ten different significations affixed to the word virtue— Its general meaning is a compound of all that is commendable in man— But this general excellence consists of many distinct properties some of them conflicting with others—hence the four cardinal virtues of the Greeks and Romans—and they are here called the labours of righteousness But when St. Peter exhorts the disciples of Christ to add to their faith virtue; and to their virtue knowledge and to their knowledge five other good moral qualities the sense of the word virtue is not well defined; for if virtue is added to faith and knowledge an imperfect enumeration of separate virtues is worse than superfluous— Tis Pope’s order to a Tailor for a suit of clothes and a pair of breeches— The storm continues— Charles’s son John Quincy came out from Boston, and dined with us and returned— I received a Letter from George Newcomb with a copy of the resolution adopted at the Quincy Town Meeting last Monday relating to the building of an Academy— The Committee of seven appointed to confer and to act in conjunction with the Supervisors of the Adams School fund are George Newcomb, William B.

Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderest all things righteously; thinking it not agreeable with thy power to condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished.  Wisdom of Solomon 12.15.  There is in this passage a good principle of moral instruction for the rulers of men, but it is not altogether correct as applied to the dispensations of Providence— For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth— Hebrews 12.6.  Mr Lunt preached at the Temple, in the forenoon from Luke 5.16—[“]And he with drew himself into the wilderness and prayed” The discourse was upon the duty of prayer, and the example of Jesus was urged in this case as the more impressive, in as much as his retirement into the wilderness to pray was immediately after the miraculous draught of fishes, and precisely at the time when he cured a man of leprosy, by merely touching him and saying I will, be thou clean, in answer to the leper, who fell on his face and besought him saying Lord, if thou wilt thou canst make me clean— This example seems to be a special recommendation of solitary prayer, as that which is commonly called the Lord’s prayer is in form and substance a social prayer.— What he prayed for in the wilderness the book does not say— The Lord’s prayer is a form of daily supplication suited to the whole human race, as children to their common parent, and after uttering the aspiration of the Soul that the kingdom of God may come and his will be done on Earth as in heaven, prays first for a daily food, and next for conditional forgiveness of sins. But this is not the prayer, to offer which Jesus withdrew into the wilderness, what was it? If he was himself a person of the triune God, to whom did he pray? and if he had power to heal leprosy with a word and to forgive sins, for what did he pray?— After the morning service Mr Lunt read the proclamation of Governor George N. Briggs for the annual thanksgiving on Thursday The 26th. of this month—and he gave notice that in the afternoon there would be a special service on occasion of closing the Sunday school for the Season— It consisted of the singing of three occasional hymns on a printed page, distributed in the pews—the children of the school being present to the number of near 150, and joining in the song— The sermon was from Ecclesiastes 11.6. “In the morning sow thy seed.” and was in the nature of an Address specially to the children— There was in this discourse, and also in the Governors proclamation for Thanksgiving a slap at Slavery— "

My wife had intended to depart with the family this morning for Washington; but the storm is not yet exhausted— It rain all the morning, and when it held up continued dark and cloudy till night— The journey was postponed Mr White was elected last Monday Representative for the town of Braintree to the Legislature of the Commonwealth for the year 1847. Mr Clapp was the whig Candidate for the same office for the town of Quincy and received 210 votes—but 222 were necessary for a choice and he fell short ten votes— On the 29th. of last August Mr White called on me and stated that he proposed to address to the Postmaster General a charge against Fisher Ames Kingsbury Postmaster at Weymouth of writing anonymous Letters to him and exacting the payment of postage upon them. He now said that he had addressed a complaint to that effect to the Postmaster general from whom he had not received any answer—and he asked my advice what he should do. I advised him to wait till I should go to Washington at the beginning of the next Month— That on arriving there I would see the Postmaster General and urge him to institute an enquiry and examination into the official conduct of Mr Kingsbury—as I believed he would and Mr White would have ample opportunity to substantiate his charge— Mr White exhibited to me several of these anonymous, libellous papers, and one palpable forgery. One was a printed advertisement offering 20 dollars reward for the discoverer who had purloined a Letter from the Post-Office, and 10 dollars for the Letter— One of these printed advertisements was posted upon the door of Mr Whites Office and attached to it a paper, on which was written “And Nathan said unto David, Thou art the man[”]— He shewed me several of the anonymous Letters, and one a plain forgery signed by the name of a Miss Raymond of Bridgwater, and all, as Mr White is well assured written by Kingsbury himself or by a tool of his, a worthless man named Pratt— I asked Mr White what could possibly be the motive of Kingsbury for such conduct. He said he did not know and could not imagine— That he and Kingsbury were both practising lawyers, and Kingsbury had begun with him by professions of friendship and mutual good offices but had first played him a shabby trick in business, and now for the last three years had been a continual annoyance to him by these offensive anonymous letters and infamous imputations— Mr Clapp was here about two hours, and Mr White not less than four— "
