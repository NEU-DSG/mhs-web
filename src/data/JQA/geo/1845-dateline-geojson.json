                "text": "2. V:30. Thursday.  I received this morning a Letter from Commodore Elliott, with one of his medals, and a direction “For Henry Clay, from His old friend J. D. Elliott” which he requests me to forward to Mr Clay— He also requests me to furnish him with a list of all the historical Societies to which I had suggested to him the idea of his sending a medal each, and that I would forward the medals to them; and one to the representative of my brother as an heir-loom— I saw him afterwards at the house without the bar, and promised to perform his requests— He was to leave the city this afternoon to return to Philadelphia where he is stationed in command of the Navy-Yard— My opinions and feelings have been ever since the duel between Baron and Decatur very unfavourable to Commodore Elliott, but I have not tried him as a judge or juror, and I could not justify to myself a repulse of the courtesy and personal respect which he now manifests to me; in the midst especially of that league of villainy and power combined against me and plotting the destruction of my life and my good name.— In the house Tibbatts of Kentucky asked leave to introduce a Bill to authorise the People of Texas to form a State Constitution of Government and for their admission into the Union, as one of the original States—and a joint Resolution pledging the protection of the United States against all foreign interposition in the interval. But the house refused to suspend the rules to let them in— The Rhode-Island question then came up—and first Burke’s motion to print 10,000 copies of the majority and minority Reports of the Committee on the Rhode Island Memorial, instead of 5000 copies of the majority report alone which he had first moved. Burt of South Carolina moved to lay the Resolution on the table. Lost by yeas and nays 78 to 100. Burke moved the previous question on his resolution but he could not obtain a majority to second him— He then modified his resolution back to the original number of 5000, and moved again and carried the previous question— The vote for printing 5000 copies was carried 102 to 80. and then the Speaker announced the Resolutions with which the majority report concluded were the subject under consideration of the house— The Resolutions are seven in number, rabid with mock democracy— L. Q. C. Elmer commenced a speech against them but was arrested at the expiration of the morning hour— The rest of the day was snarling upon the land Bill— First Assembly. "

The debate on the Land robbery Bill yesterday had become so vapid, that while Thomas Smith of Indiana was hammering out his hour upon it, I went into the Senate, and heard a debate on another Land-pilfering Bill, quite as dull as that I had escaped from in the house. I met there Mr Calderon de la Barca, the Spanish Minister, who asked me, when I proposed to publish my translation of Wieland’s Oberon I told him I did not intend it should ever be published— I had made it as a school exercise in learning German, and though far more literal, it could bear no poetical comparison without Sotheby’s translation, which had cured me of all temptation to publish mine. He said his reason for asking me the question was that he had made a Spanish translation of the Oberon, much as I had made mine, in my daily walks about the streets, and out of the gates of Berlin— He did not like Sotheby’s translation for two reasons— First because he had changed the form of the Stanza, from the light airy Ottava rima, for the heavy, cumbersome ten lines closing with an Alexandrine, thereby changing entirely the character of the Poem; and secondly, because he had omitted the sprightly tale of January and May— How Mr Calderon came to know any thing about my translation of Oberon, I know not, and did not enquire. I suppose it was from Alexander H Everett. At the house this day immediately after the reading of the Journal Charles J. Ingersoll moved a suspension of the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the joint Resolution, reported by the Committee of Foreign Affairs, for the annexation of Texas to the United States, according to the Treaty of 12. April last rejected by the Senate— This was carried by yeas and nays 107 to 63— George W. Hopkins was chairman of the Committee, and the joint resolution was taken up— Weller then moved his project of annexation as an amendment to the Resolution reported by the Committee, and Douglass moved his project as an amendment to the amendment— The first question was thus upon Douglass’s project—but C. J. Ingersoll made his hour Speech on the bare question of annexation— He scarcely glanced at the questions of right and of Constitutional power, but very positively affirmed that the annexation of Texas would not produce a rupture either with Mexico or with England. Belser of Alabama followed with an hour speech. Committee rose— Adjourned— "

Saturday  I despatched this morning Commodore Elliotts medal to Mr Henry Clay, with a Letter by the Mail—and I received from Commodore Elliott another note, requesting my opinion and advice, whether he might without impropriety present a copy of his medal to each of the foreign ministers residing here. I called on him at Fuller’s hotel, and said to him that I did not see any objection to his presenting a bronze medal to each of the foreign ministers— Though there might be some objection to his receiving presents from them in return. He then told me of presents that he had made to the sultan of Muscat, and the Son of the Bey of Egypt, and their return presents which he had transmitted to the Department of State— They told me at Fuller’s that Mr Caleb Cushing had arrived there this morning; returned from his successful mission to China—in which he has succeeded to negotiate an advantageous treaty— At the house, I found them taking the yeas and nays, on a motion made by M’Clernand of Illinois to lay on the table a memorial from certain quakers of the city of New-York, presented by Mr Phoenix— The vote to lay on the table was carried by the casting vote of the Speaker 87 to 87.— Chapman had previously made a long personal explanation about a complaint he had made against an Article in the National Intelligencer last August charging the State of Alabama with repudiating her debts— Baily moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the Resolutions for the annexation of Texas—which was done.— Douglass wanted to speak upon his own amendment, but not having his papers with him, was not ready; he moved the Committee to rise but they refused— Rhett advised him to withdraw his preamble and let the debate proceed on his first Resolution, which was the simple proposition that Texas should be annexed to the United States; Douglass assented—Joseph R. Ingersoll, made an hour speech against annexation, and W. W. Payne a furious one in favour of it— Winthrop then took the floor—the Committee rose and the house adjourned.— C. H. Upton invited me to a lecture by him this Evening against the annexation of Texas but I missed it. General Parker was here this Evening. I supped with the Typographical Society. Home at 11. "

The prayer—the singing, and the reading of a chapter of the Bible, were performed by Mr Tustin the Chaplain of the Senate— The Sermon was preached by Dr Stephen Olin the President of the Wesleyan University at Middletown, Connecticut— His text was John 14.1. “Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me.”— Dr. Olin is a man upwards of 6. feet tall; framed for a ploughman or a wood cutter— With an anxious, deeply thoughtful, not unpleasing countenance, sprawling limbs, and great aukwardness of gesticulation. But he preaches with out notes—with uninterrupted fluency, plain but very appropriate language, close argument, well chosen, and at times elegant elocution— After some verbal criticism upon the two moods in the application of the verb believe, the doctrine that he derived from the text was that Jesus Christ assuming as a fact that the disciples to whom he spoke believed in God, warned them that this belief was of itself not sufficient to satisfy the wants of their nature— That belief in God was taught by the visible creation— But the belief in God, is a barren and profitless creed unless subsidiary to it is the belief of a responsible hereafter to the existence of man; and to this the belief in Christ is indispensable— This appears to me, a very ingenious exposition of the text, and the developements of the argument were all consistent with it, judiciously selected and happily combined— The house was crowded, and the auditory chained in attention for an hour and a quarter.— After the service I returned the visit received on Friday, from Mr Thomas Hart Benton, Senator from Missouri—the first in a period of 25 years of a common residence of him and me in this city.— His wife, son and three daughters were there, and Lieutenant Fremont, his son in Law— After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Pyne read the Evening service for the second Sunday after Christmas and preached from Hebrews 13.5. “Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” An exhortation to contentment. Mr John Mason junr. told me that the grand jury had indicted T. Sangster, and said he hoped I would not interpose to screen him from punishment. Richard D. Cutts was here this evening. "

My conversation with General Parker on Saturday evening was interrupted by an engagement to attend the Lecture of Mr Upton against the annexation of Texas which was announced for 7 in the evening— It was half past 7 when I went to concert hall, but not a soul was there— I had another engagement at half past 8. and walked home to meet it— I had received a written invitation from F. Jefferson, James N. Davis, and William J. Delano, a Committee of invitation of the Columbia Typographical association to a supper, on the temperance principle in celebration of their 30th. anniversary— I had accepted this invitation; and at half past 8.

Jefferson President— The invited guests, besides myself were W. W. Seaton, Mayor of the City, Luther Severance, Member of Congress from Maine, and Editor of a Newspaper there, and Mr Gallagher a member of the Senate of Virginia. The exclusion of all spirituous liquors, Mr Jefferson said was an experiment, and it succeeded admirably well— There was much hilarity, but no disorder nor indecency— The regular toasts were given in continual succession— The volunteers complimentary to the invited guests, and drew a speech and a sentiment from each of them— I left them and came home shortly before midnight— At the house this day, after short preliminaries the rules were suspended to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the chair upon the Resolutions for the annexation of Texas to the United States.

Mr Robert Owen called on me again this morning, and requested me to ask the use of the hall of the house of Representatives, for him to deliver four lectures in four successive weeks commencing on Wednesday the 15th. of this month, upon his system of social reform. He had heretofore expressed the desire to deliver his Lectures in the Senate chamber of which I reminded him—but he said Mr Mangum the President of the Senate had informed him that he had not the power to grant the use of that hall, and that the members of the Senate were all averse to granting the use of it for any purpose. I told Mr Owen I would make the motion— A young man by the name of Cheever, a resident of this city, came, with his father a citizen of Wrentham, Massachusetts and of course one of my constituents— The father, a man within 2 years of my own age—is here on a visit of a few days to his son told me that he was a constant attendant on the town meeting elections, and at the late election had voted for me— And he rejoiced that there had been so large a majority for me in the District.— At the house, before I reached it the Speaker had made an explanation referring to a statement by Clingman yesterday that the abolition reporter Joshua Leavitt had been refused a seat at the last Session, and now occupied one of the best in the house, said that he had assigned no seat to Mr Leavitt but had merely directed that until the arrangements should be made for about 30. reporters, which took time, no one should be ejected from any seat that he should take— I found John P. Hale offering 8. Resolutions of the Legislature of New-Hampshire in favour of the annexation of Texas—the last of which declared their opinion that the annexation of Texas would increase, instead of diminishing the number of the free States— The Resolutions were read and referred to the Committee of the whole House on the State of the Union; where Hale said he should move an amendment to the annexation Resolution to test the opinion expressed in the 8th. Resolution. The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Hopkins in the chair and Yancey of Alabama, and Bailey of Virginia used up two hours for annexation, and Stetson of New-York, one for and against it— The Committee rose at the motion of Caleb B. Smith. I moved for the use of the use of the Hall for Robert Owen to deliver 4 lectures, but before I could get the question the house adjourned. "

When I made the motion yesterday in the house that the use of the Hall should be granted to Robert Owen for the delivery of four weekly lectures, upon his projects of reformation in human Society, there was evidently a majority of the house favourable to the motion. But two large classes of the members were startled— The whigs generally who generally entertain strong prejudices against the man, and his projects— And the Southern Slave-mongers—in a state of perpetual panic, and who suspected that I made this motion only to get a precedent settled, and to ask the use of the hall hereafter for some abolition or anti-slavery meeting— Arrington of North-Carolina moved to lay the resolution on the table— This was by a considerable majority refused— Black of Georgia, and Reading of New-Hampshire successively moved to adjourn— Black failed, but Reding succeeded and the question was not taken. This morning Mr Owen came, and said he heard from his son, and some of his friends that the objection was to the expence of lighting up the Hall, and that he would compress his discourses so as to ask the use of the Hall, for only two evenings, on the 29th. of this month and the 5th. of February— I called and balanced my Bank book at the Bank of the Metropolis— Then at Samuel L. Gouverneur’s but the Servant told me he was gone to his farm in Virginia.— At the house Mr Tustin formed his prayer for the day; being the anniversary of the battle of New-Orleans.— I called up the question upon my motion to grant the use of the hall to Robert Owen, and modified it so as to ask it only for two nights— Hammett the Irishman of Mississippi, opposed it on the pretence that he would never vote for granting the use of the hall for any purpose other than its appropriate use.— Arrington moved again to lay the resolution on the table and it was carried by yeas and nays 91 to 63— 24. whigs among the ayes.— Dromgoole introduced by leave another Bill for the annexation of Texas, which was twice read and referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Burke offered inflammatory Resolutions of the Legislature of New-Hampshire, concerning the Dorr controversy—but they were not received— Caleb B.

Mr Robert Owen came also, and thanked me, for offering the resolution to grant the use of the Hall of the House of Representatives for the delivery of his Lectures— He professed to be satisfied with the result, and said he would find from some other mode of communicating his views to the public— My only doubt is whether I did not stretch my complaisance to him too far in asking for him the use of the hall.

Mr Sykes, a member of the house of Representatives from New-Jersey with two persons from Philadelphia, by the names of Shaw and Phillips were among my visitors yesterday; and Mr Cushing the Minister recently returned from China was here yesterday or the day before— And Dr Mayo came and with much mystery of manner asked for a word of private conversation with me, which was only to suggest to me the idea of offering a Resolution to refer this question to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States.— But there is no doubt that constituted as it is, with a majority of slaveholding judges on the bench, they would decide that Congress in the power of admitting new States into the Union, have the power incidental to it of acquiring by purchase the territory of which new States may be formed— And that the power of declaring War carries with it the power of acquiring territory by conquest.— The real constitutional incompetency of congress is that of conferring the civil and political rights of citizens of the United States upon the people of the acquired territory, and of holding them to the duties of allegiances, without their own consent.— This objection is insurmountable; but the Supreme Court would consider it settled by the precedents of Louisiana and Florida. At the house this day John P. Hale made two attempts to introduce his amendment to all the proposed Bills or Resolutions for the annexation of Texas— It is that the territory should be divided into two equal parts, and that in the part South and West of the line there shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary Servitude— His first attempt was pronounced by the Speaker to be not in order— At the second he moved a suspension of the rules, and called for the yeas and nays— The vote was 92 to 82. a majority of ten for the leave to offer the amendment; but not two thirds and therefore it was not received— Upwards of an hour was consumed in voting on a resolution for changing the daily hour of meeting from noon to 11. A.M. David L Seymour had moved a substitute amendment to hold evening Sessions at 7. O’Clock The previous question was lost by count and carried by tellers. Seymour’s amendment was rejected without count— And the Resolution was lost by yeas and nays 72 to 79.— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. G. W. Hopkins in the chair, Samuel C. Sample of Indiana, and Ezra Dean of Ohio made hour speeches against and for the annexation of Texas— John P. Kennedy then moved the Committee to rise— Carried. A Message from the President.— The instructions to G. W. Erving— Laid on the table, and ordered to be printed. Zadok Pratt chairman of the Committee on the public buildings reported a bill of appropriation for the President’s house. "

He was on the 30th. of January 1809. appointed a second lieutenant of infantry in the army of the United States, and has continued in the service ever since— At an early period he became a higly confidential officer and during the War with Great Britain was sent in secret and confidential mission to watch the movements of the Hartford Convention, and to keep President Madison, and Mr Monroe, then Secretary of War constantly advised of them. From that time till the close of Mr Monroe’s administration; he was in the intimate confidence of Mr Monroe, and was often consulted by him with regard to the measures of his administration— He was so particularly upon the secret mission of George Graham to Galveston in 1818.— Jesup gave to C. J. Ingersoll the information upon which he procured at the Department of State, the copy of my instructions to George Graham on his departure upon that mission.— Jackson has always been friendly to Jesup, and supported him against the intrigues and persecutions of Jesup’s enemies during Jackson’s administration and that of his successor Van Buren.— He confidently believes that George W. Erving, did pretend that he had brought the Spanish Government to agree to a Treaty making the Rio del Norte the boundary— He said he had made the late judge Baldwin believe it; and also Coll. Benton—and he was under a strong impression that Erving had attempted to shake Mr Monroe’s confidence in me.— This conference detained me till near one O’Clock before I reached the house. The hour had been occupied in receiving numerous reports and Resolutions of Committees, and two or three bills of no importance had been passed— The last was a Resolution reported from a Committee by Hannibal Hamlin, for an allowance of pay to Goggin while he contested the election of Gilmer— But without taking the question the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, G. W. Hopkins in the chair; and John P. Kennedy made an hour speech against all the annexation Bills and Resolutions and John B. Dawson Morse of St. Martinsville another for immediate annexation in any one of the proposed forms— Tibbatts of Kentucky took the floor, the Committee rose not without a struggle, and the house adjourned— In the evening with Mrs John Adams, Walter Hellen and Mary-Louisa, I attended a concert of sacred music at the Church.

In the hall of the house of representatives the services of the morning were performed by Mr Fisher, a Clergyman from Kentucky Mr Tinsley the chaplain of the house at the last Session of Congress, and Mr Daily the present chaplain. Mr Fisher began by reading the first Psalm, and a beautiful trinitarian hymns from the hymn book which he requested the auditory to sing. But he not being able to set the tune himself, whatever melody they made in their hearts, there was little harmony in their voices. Mr Tinsley made the prayer before the Sermon, and Mr Fisher preached from John 19.5—the last words of the verse— “Behold the man!” [“]Ecce homo”— The argument of the discourse was the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ— The God— Man— Fervent—fluent—vehement, the contrast between the omnipotence of God, and the impotence and agonies of the man, formed the field of commonplace eloquence for Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and Methodist pulpit oratory.— All the passages of Paul’s epistles which speak of Jesus Christ as him—by whom God made the worlds, all the passages in the Prophets and Psalms, applied by St. Paul to Jesus Christ were cited, to prove that Jesus Christ was God; and then all the incidents of the trial before Pilate and of the crucifixion— Each of these theories taken by itself is to me a tremendous trial of faith—combined together and pressed upon my conscience at once my reason revolts at the thought— I cannot believe it, and the more intensely and peremptorily it is urged the more my conscience stiffens against it— The house was well filled and the auditory very attentive listeners— After the service was over, the preacher with Mr Daly and Mr Tinsley came and shook hands with me. Mr. Tinsley told me that he had been to Philadelphia, and had a tumour taken out of his forehead which had confined him ten days; and that by coming out too soon he had contracted a severe catarrhal cold— After dinner at St. John’s church, Mr Pyne read the Evening service for the first Sunday after the Epiphany, and preached from Romans 5.1. “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.” The justifying which makes peace with God through Jesus Christ, is a clear intelligible theme, and was admirably handled by Mr Pyne. Richard and Mary E E Cutts were here this evening "

He moved the previous question—but Sample moved to lay the Resolution on the table upon which Schenk called the yeas and nays which were 127 to 54.— They are not yet ready to close the debate—but Foster a Senator from Tennessee in the Senate and Milton Brown in the house offered this day the most insidious proposal yet made— A Missouri compromise, giving to Slavery all the territory South of 36.30 and preparing to recede to Mexico all the territory North of that line.Tibbatts of Kentucky made an hour speech for the annexation, upon the constitutional question; the whole compass of which was intrepid assertion of the prior right of France to Texas over that of Spain, and misapplication of numerous extracts from judge Story’s commentaries on the Constitution. He was followed byBrinkerhoff an Ohio Democrat, against all the annexation projects, and exposing with great spirit the sectional and slavemongering aspects of the whole subject. Absalom H. Chappell of Georgia replied to Brinkerhoff, maintaining that the annexation of Texas is a great National question.— Each of these was an hour speech— Holmes then took the floor—the Committee rose, and the house adjourned "

V.30 Tuesday  Mrs John Adams and Walter Hellen went last Evening to a large weekly party at the house of Mr William Wilkins the Secretary of War— It was an immense crowd, and the heat of the rooms was excessive— Walter Hellen who had already a severe cold upon him danced almost the whole evening, and rose this morning with an extinguished voice and a sore throat, which alarmed me, and for which against his will, I sent for Dr Thomas to see and prescribe for him. The Globe of last evening contains the Letter from George W. Erving to a friend, dated 12. November 1844 to a friend—Paris—being his answer to my charge against him in my address of 7. October 1844 to the young men of Boston— He had it printed on a folio sheet of paper at Paris of which he sent three copies, one to Robert C. Winthrop, and one for each of the newspapers the Globe and the Madisonian— Winthrop had mentioned this to me, last Friday, and yesterday morning he lent me the copy of the printed sheet that Erving had sent him for himself.— At the house, Zadok Pratt of New-York offered a Resolution of extensive enquiry of the Secretary of State of the amount of the debt and of the granted and ungranted lands within the undisputed limits of Texas which was adopted— John P. Kennedy offered a Resolution of Instruction to the Committee on the judiciary for some new provision necessary for closing the proceedings under the late Bankrupt Law— Objection was made, and Kennedy moved a suspension of the rules—the objection was then withdrawn, and his resolution was adopted— Atkinson of Virginia made an enquiry when the members of the house were to get the copies of the President’s Message and Documents. 10000 copies of which were ordered to be printed at the commencement of the Session.— He received no answer, for Hammett moved a suspension of the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union; which was done.

Mr Woodbury’s discourse last Evening was of about two hours duration, delivered with great rapidity; replete with various and minute details of modern and especially American improvements in the Arts and Sciences, physical, moral, political and intellectual, tinged throughout with the wormwood of democracy—like ocean brine boiled down to freshen it, with a mawkish tang of the salt remaining in the taste— It was a defence of our national character against the reproach of neglecting the progress of Science— He drew from the nature of our democratic Government the inference that scientific improvement must be the result of individual exertion and private enterprize, and enumerated a great multitude of American inventions from Fulton’s Steamers, and Whitney’s Cotton-gin, to the Western Railroad—the Fairmount waterworks at Philadelphia, and the Croton aqueduct at New-York— Then he touched lightly upon the promotion of Science which the Government has actually patronized, the Survey of the Coast, the Astronomical observatory and the exploring exhibition— He made out on the whole a very good case, and closed with a liberal exhortation to Congress to foster Science within the Constitutional limitations, and to interweave together the capabilities of the National-Institute and the Smithsonian fund. Immediately after he closed, W. W. Seaton took the chair of the meeting; a vote of thanks was passed for the discourse, with the request of a copy for publication and the meeting was dissolved— This morning a poor old deaf clergyman by the name of Joshua Lane came again to solicit charity, and another named Carter came for a contribution to build a Presbyterian church at Gettysburg Pennsylvania— He brought me a Letter of recommendation, but I thought that Gettysburg should pay for building its own churches. At the house, Edmund Burke, by a suspension of the rules carried by yeas and nays 106 to 32. introduced a new Bill for the annexation of Texas, twice read and referred to the committee— Bowlin of Missouri— Hardin of Illinois and Severance of Maine, made hour speeches in Committee for and against the annexation of Texas— Hammett got the floor and the Committee rose— I moved a call upon the President for information— Objection was made I moved a suspension of the rules but agreed to take the question tomorrow.

December last—and also of the Letters from Mr. Monroe to him, to which his were answers— He alledges as his reason for the demand that many of his own papers were destroyed when, a few years since his house at the hermitage was burnt— And this Letter is addressed to the care of Benjamin F. Butler at New-York, who forwarded it to Major Lewis, from whom Gouverneur received it yesterday— He had already on the 2d. of January, offered copies for General Jackson of his Letters if he desired them. I returned the Letters to him and he said he should immediately furnish copies of them to Major Lewis, who told him in candour yesterday that copies of them would also be furnished to the editors of the Globe.— Gouverneur proposes ultimately to deposit them in the hands of some trusty person, a friend of Jackson— He promised me a copy of this last Letter— While he was here Mrs Dwyer, widow as she said of an Officer in the army brought a duo decimo volume, an Essay on elocution of which she said he was the author and for which she asked a dollar—but on the title page of the book he was styled not an officer of the army but professor of elocution— At the house William Taylor of Lexington Virginia Chairman of the Committee of Accounts, gave notice to the house that the Committee were ready to make a report upon an interesting subject, but owing to circumstances of a favourable character which had occurred this morning they had agreed to postpone their report till to-morrow.— Preston King of Ogdensburg, New-York, offered a Resolution for the appointment of a Committee of five to enquire and report to the house whether a duel had been fought by two of its members—and if so to report a resolution of expulsion of all parties concerned therein— Yancey and Clingman had last Monday cracked a shot at each other and then shook hands and come home— A motion to lay the Resolution on the table followed and was lost 79 to 93.

This day was signalized by a memorable devlopement of democratic defalcation.— Taylor chairman of the Committee of Accounts, asked leave to make a report, which was granted without opposition— The report was a statement not remarkably lucid, that of the sum of 237000 dollars received by Caleb J. M’Nulty Clerk of the House on account of its contingent fund there is a defalcation of about 45000 dollars; for which he gives no account, and that he has drawn from the treasury large sums, and placed them in the hands of sundry persons in the city of New-York and in the State of Ohio.— He has not only failed to account for these deficiencies to the Committee, but has repeatedly disregarded their calls upon him for his attendance before them. The report concluded with three Resolutions. 1. That Caleb J. M’Nulty be dismissed from the Office of Clerk of the house. 2 That the Secretary of the Treasury be directed to institute forthwith the necessary legal proceedings to ascertain and secure the balance of public money due from him as Clerk of the house 3. That the President of the United States be requested to cause criminal prosecution to be commenced against Caleb J. M’Nulty late Clerk of the House of Representatives, for an embezzlement of the public money, and all persons advising or know or willingly participating in such embezzlement, according to the provisions of the act of Congress approved 13.

Cave Johnson moved an order to the Sergeant at arms to arrest M’Nulty and bring him before the house. I moved to strike out arrest and insert summon which was debated, but the arrest was sustained— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the chair— Hammett spoke about ten minutes, when the Sergeant at arms returned with M’Nulty who took his place at the Clerk’s table as usual— The Committee of the whole, rose the Resolutions of the Committee of Accounts were read to M’Nulty— He gave some explanations, and promised that not a dollar should be lost— The subject was postponed till to-morrow 2.

                "text": "18. IV:40. Saturday—  Roused from bed earlier than my usual hour I found the difficulty of writing so great that I was compelled to postpone the journal of yesterday and was able only to write a short answer to a Letter from my granddaughter Louisa Catherine Adams at Mrs Sedgwicks school at Lenox—Massachusetts— I found after much search several of the volumes which I need, in preparation to address the house on the Texas question. At the house Joseph Vance Chairman of the Committee of claims, succeeded in a motion to go into Committee of the whole, John White of Kentucky in the chair; to take up the Calendar of private bills from 12 O’Clock to 2. Several private bills were disposed of and among the rest that for the relief of Captainand the owners of the ship Cadmus for the passage of General La Fayette and his family from Havre to New-York in 1824.— It was after considerable debate laid on the table— A shabby proceeding on the part of the Government— At 2 O’Clock the Committee rose, and the report of the Committee of accounts in the case of Jacob B. M’Nulty the Clerk of the house was resumed— He did not make his appearance— He had promised yesterday that on the return of his accounting Clerk Kershaw, he would settle his accounts with the Committee in the space of half an hour— His Clerk Kershaw arrived last night, and was before the Committee this morning. He had a large mass of papers which the Committee had not time to examine, and produced a certificate that M’Nulty had a credit for 29000 dollars at the Bank of America in New-York— When the committee asked an order for the money, he said the Clerk must do that himself.— After two or three enquiries without satisfactory answer, Cave Johnson moved the question, on the first Resolution reported by the Committee of Accounts dismissing M’Nulty as clerk of the house 196 members answered ay—not one voice in the negative voice— The second resolution passed without counting, and the third after debate 170 to 4. Weller made an apology for having credited what M’Nulty had told him yesterday, but said he still believed there would be no loss of money to the public. George W. Hopkins moved to suspend the rule of the house requiring that the election should be held viva voce, and moved that Benjamin B. French be appointed Clerk of the house, which passed by an unanimous vote— The Speaker swore him in and the house adjourned. Evening with Mary and Walter Hellen at Mrs Ogle Tayloe’s.— Mrs Madison there. "

Sunday—  At the hall of the house of Representatives this morning, the prayer was pronounced by Mr Tuston, the Chaplain of the Senate and a Sermon of an hour and a quarter was preached by Mr Colton a chaplain in the Navy, who visited me not many days since— His text was from 1. Kings 18.43. a small part of the verse— “Go up now, look toward the Sea.” Upon this eccentric, if not whimsical text, an earnest, searching, and deeply affecting discourse was delivered on the peculiar character, condition, and claims of the Sailor— He enumerated the qualities of benevolence, of profuse generosity, of improvidence, of superstition, of sympathy with distress, of lavish bounty, of unconsciousness of danger, of resentment for unjust imputation, and ready submission to punishment for real misconduct—of docility to kind treatment and disinterested advice; and of resignation in disease and death— The fair side of the Sailor was fully exhibited— Its blemishes veiled or tenderly touched. Then followed a description of the condition of the Sailor—full of hardship teeming with danger; exposed to the treachery of the elements, of temptation, of his own passions, of the landsman and the landswoman, he always needs a guardian— Lastly his claims, upon the justice, the sympathy, and the guardianship of his Country. Mr Colton closed with an impressive and pathetic appeal to the legislative portion of his auditory, reminding them gently of their duty to cherish, and protect, and purify this precious class of servants to the community of their fellow men. He called to their remembrance the unspeakable importance of the Sailor’s services to the necessities, to the comforts and enjoyments of every other profession of civilized life— And he specially urged the duty of confirming, and universalizing the Sailors temperance by withdrawing from them all supplies of spirituous liquors— The house was crowded, and the attention to the Discourse exemplary.— Dr T. B. J. Frye dined with us, and while we were at dinner came in passed Midshipman John Quincy Adams, from Norfolk, just returned from a cruize on the coast of Africa— After dinner at St. John’s Church a Mr Hall read prayers for Septuagesima Sunday, and preached from Romans 15.4. “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.[”] "

O’Clock every morning, abridges by one hour my time already too short at my house— After calling at the Bank of Washington, and receiving a quarterly dividend due the 1st. of this month, I reached the house just as the chaplain was pronouncing the daily prayer of two minutes. Dromgoole presented sundry amendments to his bill for the admission of Texas as a State into the union— Some objection was made to the reception of them; but they were received—referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and ordered to be printed— Linn Boyd of Kentucky moved a Resolution that all debate should cease in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on Saturday next at 2. O’Clock P.M. on the joint Resolution N. 46. for the annexation of Texas to the United States and that it should then be reported to the house with such amendments as should have been agreed to, and he moved the previous question. Darragh gave notice that he would ask leave to introduce a Bill for the adjustment and settlement of claims of citizens of the United States upon the Republic of Mexico— Houston of Alabama, moved from the Committee of public lands to report a Bill.— Objection was made, and Houston moved to suspend the rules. But the Speaker told him the question must first be taken on the motion of Levy the delegate from Florida, that the first three Legislative days of February be assigned for the business of the three territories. Cave Johnson told him that he had better reduce the days to two, and put them off one week longer.— he bowed obsequious assent, and the 10th. and 11th. of February were assigned for the business of the territories.— Houston then pushed again to get in his bill from the Committee of the public lands. Vance advised him to modify his motion to suspend the rules for an hour to receive reports from Committees and Resolutions—but his motion was rejected Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the Chair, on the joint Resolution for the annexation of Texas to the United States— Rhett of South-Carolina, Caldwell of Kentucky Giddings of Ohio and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee—three to one made hour speeches for and against annexation— Rathbun took the floor and the Committee rose without a Quorum.— Boyd offered an amendment, which Douglas accepted as a modification of his Texas Resolution— Mr Duer was here this evening.

Wednesday—  Mr Lewis Johnson came this morning and requested me by advice of Mr. Maffitt to call again upon Mr M’Culloch the Comptroller to urge upon him the allowance of the remnant of claim of the Representatives of William Otis which I promised to do— But must postpone until next week— Till this Texas question is decided I can think of nothing else. I am crushed between the upper and the nether millstone of the question to speak or not to speak in this debate— If possible, Speak I must— Yet; I make no progress in my preparations— At the house, Wentworth of Illinois had moved a call on the Secretary of War for copies of the proceedings of a court of inquiry in March 1841. into charges by the Surgeon general against surgeon P. Maxwell at Fort Gibson— He called it up this morning—and at the motion of Strong it was laid on the table. Douglass of Illinois introduced a Bill of which he had given notice yesterday, for establishing military posts in the territories of Nebraska and Oregon— Twice read and referred to the Committee of Military Affairs. Orville Robinson a New-York Van-Burenite asked leave to introduce a Bill for the annexation of Texas to the United States— I called for the reading of the Bill, and upon its being read, quite a commotion rose among the Southern members. Payne of Alabama objected to its reception— It proposes to admit so much of Texas now as will constitute one Slave holding State now, and no Slavery in all the rest of the territory nor slavery but by the consent of Congress hereafter. Payne was frantic about it. Andrew Stuart on the other side moved to reject the Bill at the first reading to make an issue with the Slavers The house refused to reject the bill by yeas and nays 68 to 119.— The bill was referred with all the rest to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Tilden of Ohio presented Resolutions of the Legislature of that State against the annexation of Texas, and for the occupation of Oregon— Referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and ordered to be printed— Committee on the Union, Hopkins in the Chair— Rathbun made a warm hour speech against annexation; and Cobb of Georgia one in its favour.— Haralson took the floor. The Committee rose wanting a Quorum—and after a struggle of half an hour for a call of the house a third motion to adjourn, was carried by yeas and nays 46. to 44. In the Evening I went with Walter Hellen and heard a Lecture from Dr Hollick. "

Smyth Pyne has been associated with him as a colleague. This morning I had a visit from Mr Kavasales, who during the short period of President Harrison’s power obtained an appointment as a chaplain in the Navy— His nomination to the Senate was however made by Mr Tyler— He has just returned in the frigate Columbia, from a 3 years cruise in the Mediterranean— He like Mr Colton is extremely desirous of some action of Congress to suppress the vice of intemperance on board of our public ships— He spoke of an interview which he had last Summer with king Otho of Greece at Athens.— He says he is in good health but looks much emaciated— At the house, I omitted the name of Pollock as one of the hour speakers yesterday against the annexation of Texas. This day Slidell offered a call upon the President for information, what Officers of the United States, have been guilty of embezzlement of public monies since the 19th. of August 1841. whether any of them have prosecuted for the offence, and if not, why they have not—adopted Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Hopkins in the chair, upon the Texas question— Haralson of Georgia made a hot speech in favour of annexation— Collamer of Vermont a cool good-humoured and shrewd one against it— Hamlin of Maine, a trimming speech for and against it David L.

About half an hour was consumed on miscellaneous subjects— Hardin from the Committee on Post Offices and Post-roads, reported an amendatory bill, for one which had been recommitted to them for reducing the rate of postage— Bayly from the Committee of foreign Affairs reported a Bill for the relief of Alexander H. Everett, which was referred to a Committee of the whole house. A message from the President which had lain two days on the table was now presented, and proved to be a communication of the Treaty with China, negotiated by Mr Cushing, now ratified with the unanimous advice and consent of the Senate— The message recommends an appropriation for a regular diplomatic mission to China— At my motion it was read; referred to the Committee of foreign affairs and ordered to be printed— Sundry other communications from the executive departments were presented and disposed of—laid on the table or referred Sixteen bills from the Senate were read twice and appropriately referred— Jameson of Missouri presented Resolutions of the Legislature of that State in favour of the annexation of Texas to the United States— Committee of the whole on the State of the Union. Hopkins in the chair, upon the Resolutions for the annexation of Texas. Dromgoole began with an hour speech in support of his own project. He was followed by Barnard in a conclusive, but unavailing argument against the constitutional power of Congress to consummate this transaction. I then obtained the floor, and at the expiration of my hour had barely reached the threshold of my speech— Daniel of North-Carolina, Stone of Ohio, Morse of Maine occupied each his hour; Ellis read a rhapsody of an hour for the annexation— Norris railed an hour against his colleague Hale— Stephens of Georgia took the floor, but yielded it to Darragh, who brought the time to half past 8 in the evening, when for lack of a quorum the Committee rose, and the house adjourned.

I named Mr Woodbury, Alexander H. Everett, Joseph R. Ingersoll and Daniel D. Barnard— At the house, as soon as the journal was read, I asked the permission of the house to make an explanation of an expression which I had used yesterday, and which had been by some persons misunderstood— No objection was made— I had said that if Slavery were totally abolished, forever in Texas and the voluntary consent of Mexico could be obtained I would vote for the annexation of Texas to-morrow— This expression had been snap’d up by the slave-mongers, that it admitted the Constitutional power of Congress to annex Texas—the whole drift of my speech had been exactly the reverse— I had not been three minutes speaking, and was referring to my argument of yesterday, founded on my whole course on the Louisiana purchase in 1803. in the Senate, when Saunders of North-Carolina, interrupted me; said I had made my explanation, and objected to my proceeding further.— The Speaker would have put me down— I did not give him time, but concluded, and Saunders moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and Hopkins took the chair. Stephens of the Georgia made a sophistical speech for and against the annexation, and Woodward of South-Carolina, who got the floor unfairly, made a stupid speech for annexation— I say stupid for so he insolently called a speech made by a member from Vermont— Douglass of Illinois was in the chair— Rathbun rose and asked if that epithet of Woodward’s was in order. Douglass said it was not strictly in order, but that so much latitude of reflection had been allowed throughout the whole of this debate, that he had forborne to notice it in this particular case.— Rayner complained that by the management of the chairman none of the Southern whigs had been allowed to explain their reasons for opposition to the annexation, which Hopkins resented— Causin closed the debate, and at 2 came the hour of doom— All the propositions were successively rejected, till that offered simultaneously by Milton Brown in the House and Foster in the Senate, which was carried in Committee 107 to 102. and by yeas and nays in the house 120 to 98.Let the will of God be done.

                "text": "26. V:15 Sunday.  Funeral of Revd. William Hawley.  In the Hall of the house of Representatives, this morning the chaplain of the house, Mr Daily preached from Isaiah 33.20. “Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. 21. But there, the glorious Lord will be unto us, a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.”— This language, Mr Daily said was figurative— Zion was the Christian Religion, and Jerusalem was the Church of Christ— The quiet habitation, was the Peace on earth and good will to men, proclaimed by the Angels at the birth of Christ; and in God’s own due time this peace will become universal throughout the habitable globe, and Jerusalem a quiet habitation— The tabernacle not to be taken down is typical of the stability of the Christian Religion.— The gates of hell shall not prevail against it. the exposition of the 21st. verse partook of its obscurity— The translation is obviously defective— That the glorious Lord should be a place of broad rivers and streams, gives indistinct ideas, which the comment of the preacher did not elucidate—but he dramatized the exclamation of old Simeon, and the sword of the Lord and of Gideon, and swung round in his hand the quarto Bible and told a story of a young man who on a voyage down the Ohio to New-Orleans, stop’d into a shop to purchase the history of the 4 kings meaning a pack of cards—instead of which the shopkeeper persuaded him to take a bible. 15 years afterwards the same man passing upwards through the same city of Cincinnati with a beautiful wife, three lovely children and an affluent fortune, told the shopkeeper that they were all fruits of his Bible substitute for the history of the 4 kings— The house was crowded, and a choir from one of the methodist churches, sung two hymns one of them “How beauteous are their feet.” At 3. after dinner, by invitation from the vestry of St. John’s church, I went to the late residence of Mr Hawley and walked in procession thence to St. John’s Church where the funeral service were performed, and a sermon preached by the Revd. Stephen H Tyng of Philadelphia, from Hebrews 9.27.— [“]It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.” The church was so excessively crowded that it was with great difficulty that I got in and reached a seat. Mr Pakenham with whom I walked in procession did not enter the church The body was interred in the church-yard. "

Mr Burnap, minister of the Unitarian church at Baltimore; he said he had been two or three weeks here preaching at the unitarian church by exchange with Mr Hale who is for a time officiating at that establishment here— When I got to my seat in the house they were taking the yeas and nays on a motion of Aaron V. Brown, Chairman of the Committee on the Territories, to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— The vote to go into Committee was 113 to 40— Weller of Ohio was placed in the Chair— Cary of Maine asked if the Bill to graduate the price of the public lands was not the first to be taken up. Chairman answered yes. A. V. Brown, moved to lay that aside and to take up the bill for establishing the territory of Oregon. And here commenced an ominous struggle— Douglas of Illinois moved to take up a bill introduced by him, to purchase 1500 copies of a history of Oregon Calefornia &c for the use of the house, and in the use of them to distribute one copy to each member of the two houses of Congress— Cave Johnson’s economics took fire—he moved to take up the Oregon Bill and it was done— Charles J. Ingersoll moved to lay it aside and take up the Greenhow book bill and it was done. Duncan railed and raved, insisting that the question had not been understood, and must be put again— The chairman stuck to his text— Cave Johnson moved again to lay the book-bill aside and take up the Oregon bill, but lost the vote, and started a sneaking debate of two hours about the honesty or the shame of purchasing books at the public expense for the private use of the members themselves—half a dozen dirty amendments were moved and all rejected, till the bill was laid aside to be reported and the Oregon bill again taken up. The first section was read, and Hammett moved the Committee to rise and report and pass the book bill— Committee rose and reported the bill. Douglass moved the previous question on engrossment. Cave Johnson moved to lay the bill on the table and called yeas and nays 84 to 94. Yeas and nays on the passage of the bill— Yeas and nays on the passage of the bill 107 to 79. A. V. Brown then moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union again which was carried— The first section of the Oregon Bill was read and Brown moved to strike out 9. from the Northern boundary in the bill, to read 54.40 instead of 54.49. whereupon I began a debate which continued till 4. O’Clock when the Committee rose and the house soon after adjourned— Evening visits from Mr John A Dix heretofore Aid de Camp to General Brown— Now a Senator from the State of New-York— Also from Richard D. and Mary E.

Morning call from Dr Todsen, who told me he was now employed in making some translation for the Department of State, because they could find no other person here who could do the work—for they were extremely hostile to him for his political opinions.— The doctor would have been more communicative, but Robert Owen came in and he withdrew. Mr Owen gave me to read an address which he said he had determined to make directly to both houses of Congress, requesting the use, first of the Senate chamber, and then of the Representative Hall, to deliver three Lectures upon his system for the improvement of human Society— He intimated a wish, that I should present his Memorial to the house which I consented to do, but he read to me a separate paragraph, on a small slip of paper which he wished to introduce into his address, and which affirmed that I had a favourable opinion of the usefulness of his system.— I told him that I could not permit the introduction of my name, and that if I should it would of itself be fatal to his application.— He acquiesced.— At the house, the day was spent in calling for Reports of Committees, and the States for Resolutions, which would give no rise to debate— I asked Preston King if he intended to move a Call on the President for the correspondence in the negotiation for Oregon.— He said no—because it would be taken as a symptom of hostility to the administration— But if I would move the call, he would vote for it. The house had been some time in Session when I took my seat— A bill from the Senate to establish the Smithsonian Institution, had been received read and referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union. After all the Committees had been called, the States beginning with Maine were called for Resolutions.— Burke moved an order to the clerk to suspend the compilation of a tenth volume of U.S. Laws ordered at the last Session of Congress, till a joint Resolution for a new Edition of U.S. Laws, pending before the Senate shall be disposed of by Congress. Carried— Burke moved also an investigation by the committee on the expenditures of the Navy department, of a swindling contract with James C. Zabriskie of New Jersey; and he presented a paper containing evidence of the filthiness of this contract. He moved the previous question, and the resolution was adopted— I moved a call upon the President for copies of the negotiation for the Oregon— C. J. Ingersoll attempted to evade the call but it was carried by yeas and nays 166. to 4— Enoch Woods here, a beggar. "

Barnwell Rhett, Kenneth Rayner Henry D. Foster, and Shepherd Cary, four members of the Committee being absent— I read a few pages of the memorial, but the warder of the Committee rooms soon gave us notice that the house was in Session, and we adjourned to next Wednesday 10. O’Clock— I found the house engaged in the consideration of resolutions the call of the States for which had not been completed yesterday. Among those adopted yesterday was one offered by Hopkins that copies of all the printed bills and of the Calendar of the house should be regularly laid on the Reporters desks. Houston now moved a reconsideration of this Resolution—on this question the vote by rising was 67 to 41. no Quorum. The yeas and nays were called— I asked if all the printed documents of the house were to be laid, on the desks of all the reporters, 30 in number— The Speaker did not know. I asked if the Speaker did not understand the meaning of the Resolution— He said I was as able to understand the order as he was.— The vote to reconsider was 119. to 32. and then the resolution was laid over for debate— Reuben Chapman offered a Resolution yesterday and moved the previous question, that the members of the house consider that the public offices of the Union ought to be distributed among the States, according to their federal population— I enquired if he had considered the bearings of his resolution upon the constitutional executive power of appointment to Office. He said that it was nothing but the opinion of the members of the house— His motion for the previous question failed— I said I wished to debate the Resolution and it was laid over.— Belser moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the Oregon Bill.— I urged a postponement of some days for Greenhow’s book, and for the answer to the call upon the President for the state of the negotiation But the house went into Committee— Duncan, Belser and Bowlin made hour speeches for the immediate passage of the Oregon Bill—the Committee then rose the House went again into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union passed three appropriation bills and adjourned.

Ingersoll opposed the bill— While he was speaking John Tyler junr brought in a Message from the President, which in the expectation that it related to this subject, but which proved to be a mere communication from the Governor of Illinois upon Reports of the decisions of the U.S— Supreme Court— Hamlin of Maine then made a fiery speech for Oregon and against England— Elmer, Washington Hunt offered a few remarks. Winthrop moved to strike out the first section of the Bill— A. V. Brown, offered two amendments—the Committee rose and the house adjourned— In the Evening, Mrs John Adams and Walter Hellen went to the Assembly— Mr Connell partook with us of an Oyster-supper— My nephew J.

Romulus M.

Not a day passes, but I receive some pamphlet or book from the author, besides ten or twelve daily Newspapers which now come twice a day by the morning and evening Mails— They absorb so much of my time, that I have scarcely any left for my proper business, which is thus lamentably neglected, and they scatter my attention and my spirits over such a multitude of subjects that they make it impossible to concentrate my thoughts and action upon any one. This is inexpressibly painful to me, and yet I am utterly unable to devise a remedy for it— I received yesterday a duodecimo volume of 276. pages, printed at Boston, and entitled Vindication of Russia, and the Emperor Nicholas, by David K. Hitchcock; and this morning a Discourse before the Society of the Sons of New-England, of the City and County of Philadelphia, on the history of the early settlement of their Country—being their first anniversary—delivered December 21 1844. by their President Samuel Breck— who with his father in 1791. removed from Boston to Philadelphia, and has resided there ever since. His father removed in discontent at being as he thought overtaxed at Boston. Yet dulces reminiscitur Argos— In the house after the usual number of spiteful, and stupid preliminaries by the patent democracy of the house they went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Weller in the chair upon the Oregon territory bill— Winthrop who had taken the floor yesterday made an excellent speech against the bill and was answered with brutality by Shepherd Carey of Maine and Andrew Kennedy of Indiana— Morse and Severance, had a sparring bout with Shepherd Carey and Hannibal Hamlin about the Ashburton Treaty.— I moved as an amendment for the first section of the bill, that the President should cause to be notified to the British Government that we annul and abrogate the joint occupation convention of 1827— My amendment was lost by tellers 75 to 77. Hammett moved in substance the same amendment as the last section of the bill, and it was carried by tellers 79 to 77.— Winthrop moved an additional section, prohibiting Slavery throughout the territory. Carried by tellers 85 to 66. Sundry other amendments were proposed and rejected, and the bill was thus reported to the house— Then came the previous question. Carried— Motions to adjourn— That the amendments might be printed. Rejected— In order to make it the unfinished business of Monday Morning the previous question was put and carried, and then the house adjourned without taking the main question. In the evening with Mary, Walter Hellen and Louisa, I attended an Amateur Concert. "

The winter has come at last with its severity of frost but with the smile of bright sunshine— The Newspapers had announced that divine service would be performed in the hall of the house of representatives this morning by the chaplain of the Senate Mr Tuston; but at a quarter past 11. I found a stranger, said to be Dr Whelpley of New-York, in the midst of a discourse upon the education of children— Its tone was rather that of a dissertation or Lecture than of a Sermon, and if he had taken a text there was nothing in the text of the discourse to indicate what it was— The speaker had not much the appearance of a clergyman but his speech was an exceedingly earnest exhortation to his hearers, and especially to the Parents to fulfil their duties in the education of their children— There was nothing new in the argument, and nothing remarkable in the Style which was plain or the delivery which was without rant or affectation— The common-place topics were handled with good sense and simplicity and with impressive fervour— The discourse brought to my mind the admirable Sermons of Tillotson upon education, but my recollection of them was not sufficiently distinct to warrant the conjecture that they had furnished ideas to the discourse of this day.— After the service and before dinner I received visits from Mr Robert C. Winthrop and Mr Gardiner of Boston After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Pyne read the evening prayers for Quinquagesima Sunday and preached from Matthew 5.16. [“]Let your light so shine before men that they may see, your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven” Mr Pyne’s christianity is all summed up in benevolence and that I believe is what constitutes its excellence above all other systems of religion or morals that were . . .— Mr Pyne pointed his hearers to the stress laid in this precept of Jesus to his disciples on the influence of example and observed how it was carried out by Jesus himself through How the immediate and remote purpose of every miracle that he performed was to do good—and he exhorted his hearers in every action of their lives to scrutinize their own motives, and before acting, to ascertain by self-examination, if their light so shines as to exhibit good works, and tend to the glory of God— He gave notice that during the approaching lent there would be service alternate days at the churches.

Fahrenheit 20 at Sunrise  The severe cold of the season brought on again the racking cough with which my wife had been afflicted from the time of her return to this city last October but which had much subsided. all day yesterday she suffered cruelly with it, and the whole night without respite of ten minutes till half past 4 this morning. She kept her bed all this day— I attended the house at its first meeting. There were not 60 members present— The usual pressure of interloping business occurred, and I addressed the Speaker three or four times before he would hear me— I asked him if this was not the regular day for the call of the States for Petitions.— He said the first business of the day was the unfinished business of Saturday the questions upon the amendments reported by the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to the Oregon territory Bill. I said I took it for granted that those questions would not be taken till the house should be full. In the mean time I asked leave to present a memorial from John J. Abert and five others a Committee of the National Institute asking aid from the Government—together with sundry documents— The Speaker said it could only be received with the unanimous consent of the house—and after a pause he said the Chair hears no objection and the Memorial was received— I moved its reference to a select Committee of five, requesting that my name might not be of the number, considering myself as one of the petitioners— The motion was agreed to without opposition— I went to Joseph R. Ingersoll and asked him to give me five names to recommend to the Speaker for the Committee— He accordingly gave me 5 names, but my own was at the head of them. I struck it out and inserted that of Ingersoll himself in its place— I changed one other of the names, and sent the list, by French the Clerk to the Speaker. A debate of two hours arose, about a bill from the Senate concerning the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal; in which all the members from Maryland took a deep interest— Then came the questions on the Oregon territory Bill. Aaron V. Brown moved that a separate question should be taken on Hammett’s amendment requiring the President to give notice to the British Government that we annul and abrogate the joint-occupation convention of 1827— And Campbell demanded a separate question on Winthrop’s amendment prohibiting Slavery throughout the territory. It was carried by yeas and nays 121 to 69. and Hammett’s amendment was carried 121 to 82— The bill passed 140 to 59. Mr Markoe here this Evening. "

My wife had again a distressing night, and was again all this day confined to her bed— The mails still so absorb my time that I am upon the verge of losing the continuity of my journal. I had a long morning visit from Mr Asahel Huntington, one of the public County Attornies of Massachusetts and now in attendance on the Supreme Court of the United States as the Counsel and agent for the State, upon a writ of error from a decision of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts upon the constitutionality of her licence Laws. Mr Huntington has finished his business here, and departs for home to-morrow. In the Senate this day Evans chairman of the Committee of Finance reported against the revived Sub-treasury-bill which had passed the house; and Archer chairman of the Committee of foreign affairs reported for the rejection of the joint-resolution from the house for the annexation of Texas— Buchanan a minority of one in the Committee, undertook to support the joint Resolution from the house. In the house on the motion of Burke a resolution from the Senate, for the appointment of a joint Committee of 3 members from each house, to ascertain the mode of counting the votes of the election of President and Vice-President of the United States, and of informing the persons chosen of their election was concurred in by the house— Tibbatts moved a suspension of the rules to smuggle in a bill of his own making an appropriation for the improvement of certain harbours and rivers.— There was a bill already reported by the Committee of Commerce for the same purpose— Tibbatts wanted to explain but the house would not hear him—his motion to suspend the rules was rejected 52 to 90. Hardin moved to suspend the rules to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up his Post-Office Bill. They went into Committee Linn Boyd in the Chair; but instead of the Post-Office bill took up Houston’s land plunder bill— It was debated by Shepherd Cary, Thomasson, Andrew Stuart, Bidlack and Payne, till Weller got out of patience and moved the committee to rise for him to offer a resolution to close the debate and take the Bill out of Committee to-morrow at 12 O’Clock which was done without opposition, Weller consenting to take one O’Clock instead of 12. Then the house went into Committee again on the same bill, and Bower, David L. Seymour, Jameson and Hannibal Hamlin discussed the choicest mode of robbing the public lands, until the Committee rose again. Dr Bayly reported a Bill for the relief of Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones— Sundry Executive Communications were presented, and the house adjourned. A Sailor by the name of George Lewis was here this Evening. "

Fahrenheit 20.— Snow—  My wife continues confined to her bed with a racking cough, and she thinks a regular attack of Erisypelas— I had yesterday sent round notice by one of the pages of the house to the members of the select Committee on the Memorial of the American Statistical Association concerning the errors in the 6th. census, to attend this morning the meeting of the Committee— Only three members however besides myself attended, and no quorum was formed. In the house the Committee on the part of the house for counting the presidential election votes were announced Burke, A. A. Chapman, Joseph R. Ingersoll David L. Seymour and Vance— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Linn Boyd in the chair, on the Bill to reduce and graduate the price of the public Lands. Hannibal Hamlin declared himself in favour of Cary’s amendment to the bill because he abhorred the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, and he was for keeping them out of the hands of speculators— Vinton of Ohio, Causin of Maryland and Collamer of Vermont had made unanswerable speeches against the bill and Houston this morning abused an hour in misrepresenting them, and refuting his own false colouring of their arguments— There was left only 20 minutes which Rathbun occupied in opposing the Bill— Amendments were proposed by Andrew Stuart, Murphy and Thomasson, and rejected— Brinkerhoff offered an amendment to Cary’s amendment, which Cary accepted, and this was carried as a substitute for the original bill— It was then reported to the house— Houston moved the previous question which was seconded— Vinton moved to lay the bill on the table and called the yeas and nays—carried 103 to 91— Hamlin immediately moved to go into committee of the whole on the state of the Union again to take up the Post-Office bill. They went into Committee and Weller moved to take up the bill to extend the right of suffrage in the city of Washington; but the Indian appropriation bill was first on the business of the Committee and was taken up, amended, reported to the house and passed—one of the amendments was of 62502 dollars and 43 cents for interest on bonds of several States, to be repaid when they shall pay their debts— I objected to it as being to the extent of the appropriation an assumption of State debts; but my objection was voted down. The committee rose and the house adjourned soon after 4.— In the Evening Emanuel Fisher and a Mr Hatch from Connecticut were here— Snow gale—and starlight—bitter cold. "

Mr Fisher left with me a newspaper, a blank book with certificates from another newspaper pasted into it, and a manuscript Letter warmly recommending Mr Fisher to somebody by Mr Humes Porter, a clerk in the War department, and brother to the sometime Secretary of War, James Madison Porter, and to David R. Porter whose term as Governor of Pennsylvania has just expired.— Mr Fisher’s papers showed that he had been displaced as keeper of a light house, somewhere upon one of the western lakes—but his visit this morning was to plead his poverty—his sickness and his distress for a contribution— Severe winter and waggon-loads of ice driving about the Streets.— At the house John P. Kennedy slip’d in a call upon the Secretary of the Treasury for copies of certain instructions to the collectors of the customs since last June— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the Indian appropriation Bill, which was not reported to the house yesterday as I had supposed.— Sundry amendments were offered and rejected— Giddings made some enquiries concerning infamus items of expenditure veiled under charges such as for important services render the commanding General in Florida—the real payment being to the owners of runaway Slaves— Base as this transaction was in itself, it has been aggravated by fraudulent charges for the pretended increase of the Slaves while fugitives, and hundreds of thousands of dollars, deducted from sums due to the Indians, to pay for fictitious runaway Slaves from Georgia swindlers, and for their pretended increase. Giddings now exposed this abomination again as he had done before. Edward J. Black of Georgia, by a virulent personal invective upon Giddings, provoked him to return it with more than interest, but without its brutality— Black in his rage crossed over from his Seat, went round behind the Speaker and coming within the bar behind Giddings as he was speaking, made a pass at the back of his head with a cane. Slidell and Hammett however watching Black’s movements crossed over so as to meet him, as he re-entered within the bar, before he had approached near enough to reach Giddings with the cane. As he pressed on with a face convulsed, and the look of a coward fiend, Hammett threw his arms round him and bore him off as he would a woman from a fire. Black sneaked back to his seat; and in a tone so low that he could not be heard whispered an apology for having trespassed on the orders of the house. Emanuel Fisher was here again with a Mr Walker from Medway. "

By the rules of the house the first and fourth Friday’s of each month are devoted to the passage of bills which occasion no debate—by this process 69 bills and resolutions were passed through the Committee, reported to the house and ordered to be engrossed for a third reading.

I only opened the book this morning, and could read a few pages of the introduction when the time came for repairing to the house.— There I found them already engaged in the consideration of private claims— Leonard of New-York had prevailed on the house to discharge the Committee of the whole from the consideration of a bill from the Senate authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to make arrangement or compromise with any of the sureties or bonds given to the United States by Samuel Swartwout late collector of the customs at New-York— Vance chairman of the Committee of claims moved a suspension of the rules to take up and act upon the private bills reported yesterday from the Committee of the whole; which after some officious interruption from Levy the delegate from Florida was finally carried. 65 bills and joint Resolutions were thus taken up and passed without opposition. Upon three debate arose. A bill for the relief of James S. Campbell, an old claim of indemnity for loss sustained during the War of Independence, which after a tenacious discussion was laid on the table— The bill to authorise the Secretary of the Treasury to compromise with any of the sureties of Samuel Swartwout, was tamely debated till Caldwell moved to lay it on the table and called the yeas and nays which were 96 to 58. G. W. Jones moved a reconsideration, but could not get the yeas and nays and the rediscussion was postponed till next Monday.— Then came the bill for the relief of the heirs of James C. Watson, deceased. A Georgia Slave-trade speculation— Seminole Indian negro Slaves, taken prisoners by Creek Indian allies of the United States said to have been promised by General Jesup as spoils of War to the Creeks—sold by them to Watson for 14600 dollars; but refused to be delivered to Watson’s agent, because General Jesup had promised to restore them, and they were actually restored to their Seminole masters, and so the United States are to indemnify Watson for the loss of his bargain— It was debated a full hour, and then Hammett, moved the previous question on the engrossment of the bill— I moved to lay it on the table— The house adjourned— Mr Goell here this Evening.

Sunday  Mr. Daily preached this morning in the hall of the house of Representatives from Revelation 21. and part of the 3d. and 4th. verses— “And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying—there shall be no more death”— This is but a small part of the two verses, but there was to me deep pathos in the text for I had just received a Letter from Isaac Hull Adams at Medford with the sad tidings of the decease last Tuesday morning the 4th. of this month of Mrs Abby S. Angier eldest daughter of my deceased brother Thomas— A most lovely, amiable and accomplished woman, at whose newly finished and well furnished dwelling house I had passed a pleasant evening, but two or three days before I last left home to come here— The bereavement to her husband, to her mother and sister is irreparable, and the loss to the community much to be lamented.— A discourse upon death though from the most vociferous methodist that I ever heard, fell with deep impression upon my mind— Mr Daily’s fluency never fails him, but the straining of his voice and the violent accompaniment of his gesticulations keep me often in alarm lest he should burst a blood vessel in the midst of his discourse. Yet after he has finished there is very little; and seldom any thing left upon my memory— The double nature of man, matter and mind, body and soul, the mortal and immortal part, the universality of death and the mystery of the resurrection of the body formed the theme of Mr Daily’s declamation, and the final consummation of the promise from heaven that there shall be no more death is the Christian religion and the bible— There was a dramatic scene of the death bed of the father of a family which had it not been used up, would have been affecting— The choir from the Wesleyan methodist church sang the 100th. psalm, and the hymn— There is a land of pure delight.— After the service I called at judge Cranch’s and informed them of the death of Mrs Angier— I visited also at Coleman’s National Hotel, Mr Daniel Webster and his family.— His sons Fletcher and Edward, Mrs Fletcher Webster, a Mr and Miss Fletcher were all there— After dinner at Saint John’s church Mr Pyne read the service for the first Sunday in Lent, and preached from Psalm 4.4— “Commune with your own heart, upon your bed, and be still.” The duty of religious retirement— Richard D. Cutts spent the evening here. "

Archer, Chairman of the Committee of foreign relations of the Senate, against the joint resolution sent to them by the house for the annexation of Texas to the United States, absorbed this morning’s hours till I went to the house— These two State papers, form a perfect parallel and contrast of intellect politics and morals, between Virginia and New-England— They are upon one and the same subject, and embrace the same topics. Archers report is a Daguerrotype miniature portrait of Virginia— Webster’s address is a full length likeness of New-England, or rather of Massachusetts. For Webster’s mind though native of New-Hampshire, and graduate of Dartmouth, has been moulded by thirty years of association with Massachusetts, to the Boston standard of thought, and the mental scale of Harvard— At the house, the bill for the relief of the heirs of Samuel C. Watson, with the question to lay it on the table pending over it was the unfinished business from Saturday—but this day and to-morrow had been specially assigned for the business of the territories; and after not more than a quarter of an hour of smuggling, the rules were suspended, and the house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, John W Davis in the chair.— Robert Dale Owen, had introduced, a substitute for the Bill from the Senate to dispose of the Smithsonian bequest. Without reading it was ordered to be printed, and referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union.— Some half a dozen bills for squandering money in the territories went through the Committee, without opposition or remark— They were chiefly gotten up by the Jew Delegate from Florida Levy— Cave Johnson stop’d one or two of them which were no sooner looked into than they were found to be gull-traps, and were rejected.— At last one bill was brought up for the admission of the Territories of Iowa and of Florida, each as a State into the Union. A question arose about fixing the boundaries of the State of Iowa—with regard to which there is a controversy between them and the State of Missouri— Duncan moved an amendment specially defining the boundary of Iowa, against which Augustus Dodge, the Delegate from the Territory most solemnly protested. But Vinton rose in support of Duncan’s amendment—the Committee rose, and the house adjourned. "

There has been severe cold, and a snow-storm of the first class at the North— A fall of snow at Boston on the 4th. blocking up the streets, in some corners ten feet deep, and drifting so as to leave the pavement in many places bare— Then Fahrenheit’s thermometer at 7 degrees below zero. This is one of the exemplifications of the great difference of climate between Boston and this city.— We have had snow not enough to furnish a slider for the runners of a Sleigh—none to cover the ground for 24 hours— And Fahrenheit never lower than 10. The weather has now again become warm as Spring— This was the second of the days specially assigned for the consideration of the business relating to the territories— By a Slavemonger trick the admission of the two Territories of Iowa and of Florida, was included in one bill— There is a controversy concerning their respective boundaries between the Territory of Iowa, and the State of Missouri, which occasioned much of yesterday’s debate, and which terminated in a political dissertation by Vinton of Ohio, one of the best and ablest men in the house, upon the future power and influence upon this Union of the valley of the Mississippi—just as he began the Committee rose and the house adjourned over to this day; when upon going into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Vinton took up his theme, and expatiated upon the future centripetal glory and conservative power of the West for the preservation and perpetuation of this Union—for his allotted hour— I dare not say how I felt when he closed— Belser of Alabama followed him with a bathos of sequel to his argument sinking into the slough of Slavery.— There was a proviso in the bill that when the population East of Suwanee river shall amount to 35000 federal numbers they shall be set off as a separate State—but this was struck out notwithstanding a desperate struggle by Levy. Morse of Maine moved a conditional proviso that the admission of Florida, should be on condition of her People’s expunging from their Constitution two Articles—one prohibiting their Legislature from emancipating Slaves, and the other authorising them to pass Laws excluding coloured persons from the State.— Levy asked him if he was serious. The Committee rose 76 to 76. by the casting vote of the chairman Cave Johnson moved to go into Committee again and take out the bill in 20 minutes—and the previous question— I moved to adjourn— Not in order— I moved to lay Johnson’s resolution on the table—tug of an hour and a half closing with an agreement to resume the debate on the bill next Thursday. adjourned past 5.

Mr Pugh, and three of the workmen at the Navy came last evening, to request my assistance to obtain a favourable consideration of a claim which they have presented for indemnity arising from their having been in October 1843 suddenly and without an hour’s notice discharged from their service at the yard— This was done by David Henshaw, on the plea that the appropriation had given out— 300 workmen at daily wages, many of them having families, were thus dismissed—to be starved or fed as chance should turn up— They complained and remonstrated with the President, who wheedled them along with promises for a space of six weeks before they were set to work again— And their wages were suspended in the interval— The select Committee on the Memorial from the American statistical association upon the errors of the 6th. census should have met this morning, but Mr Brengle was except myself the only member who attended. I had received a memorial from the Massachusetts Medical Society upon the same subject which I entered at the clerk’s office, and had referred to the same Committee— This was the day for opening and counting the votes of the electoral colleges for the Offices of President and Vice President of the United States for four years from the 4th. of March next— The house met as usual at 11— And was busily occupied until 12. in receiving and disposing of executive communications, and bills from the Senate— I asked leave to present a memorial from Enos Stevens, offering an invention which he calls a Legislative Teller for taking the yeas and nays expeditiously—but one objection was made, and the memorial was not received— Precisely at Noon the Senators came into the Hall and took Seats provided for them in front of the Clerk’s table— Willie P. Mangum President of the Senate took the Speaker’s chair and the Speaker occupied a chair at his left hand— The votes were counted and the result announced 170 votes for James Knox Polk of Tennessee as President and George Mifflin Dallas as Vice President, and 105 votes for Henry Clay of Kentucky as President and Theodore Frelinghuysen of New-York as Vice-President— Dallas of Pennsylvania— The Senate then withdrew. The house passed a joint Resolution to inform the President and Vice-President elect of their new dignities and adjourned.— I had in the midst of the ceremony received from the Marshal Hunter a summons to attend the criminal Court to testify against Sangster. I went immediately after the adjournment of the House—but the cause was already continued to the next term of the Court in March. "

Duer, and by Mr Morehead one of the Senators from Kentucky, who came to enquire if I could inform him where he could find a Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dr Sibley, written in the Summer of 1803 and giving in more detail than in any other of his published Letters his reasons for the opinion that the annexation of Louisiana to the United States transcended the Constitutional powers of Congress— My recollection did not enable me to give him the desired information. He wanted it to use in a speech which he proposed to make, and did make in the Senate this day in support of the report of the Committee of foreign relations of that body, against the joint resolution from the house for the annexation of the Republic of Texas to this Union. I went to the house this morning with the intention if the opportunity should be allowed of making an hour speech on F. H. Morse’s proposed amendment to the bill for admitting Iowa and Florida as States into the Union; but immediately after the meeting of the House, and the appointment of Burke and Linn Boyd as the Committee on the part of the house to notify Polk and Dallas of their election as President and Vice President of the United States— John W. Davis of Indiana renewed the motion which Cave Johnson had failed to carry on Tuesday, that all debate should cease on the bill for admitting Iowa and Florida as States into the Union, in twenty minutes after going into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union and taking it up— I protested again against this precipitation; moved to lay Davis’s Resolution on the table and asked and barely obtained the yeas and nays. Davis upon advice of some of his associates extended his time from twenty minutes to two hours; and my motion to lay his resolution on the table was rejected 50 to 91— The house then went into Committee John W. Davis in the Chair and the two hours were occupied by Morse, about half an hour in support of his amendment, and an hour and a half by Baily of Accomack and Levy the delegate from Florida, in railing against the Northern States and the abolitionists— I was allowed no opportunity to speak—other amendments were introduced; the proviso in the bill that when the white population east of Suwany river shall amount to 35000, they shall be set off as a separate State was struck out—when the bill was reported to the house, the Speaker decided that the question upon that amendment should not be taken in the house— I appealed from that decision. Winthrop read a passage from Jefferson’s manual, the Speaker recanted and the house concurred with the Committee and struck out the proviso, 123 to 77. The bill passed 145 to 34. "

Snow in the night— Mr James Knox Polk arrived last night in this city— His arrival was notified by a democratic Cannonade upon the Capitol hill, and a democratic escort from the Depot of the Rail-road Cars to his lodgings at Coleman’s National Hotel. He brought with him his wife and a small retinue, and was accompanied by the Vice-President elect, George Mifflin Dallas who coming from his residence at Philadelphia, joined him at the relay house 9 miles on this side of Baltimore— The parade of his reception was all partizan, and a display of one democrat member of Congress to represent each State and Territory of the Union formed a congenial part of his cortège from the cars to his lodgings.— He has affected to speak at Nashville and at Cincinnati of being the President of the Nation and not of a party, but he is sold, soul and body to that grim idol half albino half negro the compound of democracy and of Slavery, which by the Slave representation in Congress rules and ruins the Union— Mr Houck the man from Missouri recommended to me yesterday by Garrett Davis of Kentucky came this morning, and I went with him to the lodgings of Genl. Almonte the Mexican Minister, but he was sick in bed with a fever— It was relief to me, for the morning’s mail had brought the tidings of Santa-Anna’s final overthrow, and captivity in Mexico.— The house very soon after meeting went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and after a close and convulsive disorderly struggle to take up the Cumberland road bill, the Post-Office Bill, the Bill for extending the right of suffrage in the city of Washington, settled first on the unfinished business at the last rising of the Committee the bill of appropriation for the improvement of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers, which was amended reported and passed without opposition—then upon the navy pension bill passed also without opposition—and then upon the annual appropriation bill for the West Point Academy, which brought up the Prince of demagogues Duncan— He made a furious speech of an hour and more of charges against the whigs of frauds in the recent presidential election— He was repeatedly called to order, and pronounced by the chairman Jameson, out of order, just feebly enough to encourage him to proceed, as he did proceed without in the least heeding the decision against him. He attacked also the abuses of the army and navy the epauletted loafers, and was answered but not silenced by Haralson, Dromgoole and Parmenter— But the West-Point bill passed by yeas and nays—85 to 42.

                "text": "16. V. Sunday  In the Hall of the house of Representatives Mr Tuston the Chaplain of the Senate preached for the last time to the present Congress. His text was from Acts 26.28. [“]Then Agrippa said unto Paul, almost thou persuadest me, to be a Christian.” He read the whole chapter of which this verse forms a part and expatiated largely upon the transcendent excellence of the character of Paul, upon his unparalled services and sufferings in the cause of the gospel, upon the wonderful powers of his mind, exemplified in the history of his wanderings related in the book of Acts, in his epistles and in his Orations, especially that before Agrippa. I believe it must be admitted by every reflecting reader of the New Testament that next to Jesus himself, Paul stands unrival’d as the great pillar of the Christian Gospel— And although the record of all his speeches in the Book of Acts would not make up in quantity one half of the shortest philippic of Demosthenes or of Cicero, not the second or divine philippic of the Roman, nor the Oration for the crown of the Athenian can claim the palm of eloquence by the side of this address to Agrippa, or of the speech to the Athenians upon the altar to the unknown God— Upon the text itself Mr Tuston’s argument seemed to me to drag its slow length along— It is a pregnant text, but seemed to elude his obstetric hand. He drew from it one ingenious inference—that as Agrippa was almost persuaded to become a Christian therefore persuasion is the only lawful weapon to be used for the conversion of infidels. And then came a blast of indignation against all religious intolerance and persecution. At St. John’s Church after dinner, Mr Pyne read the Evening service for the second Sunday in Lent and preached from Ecclesiastes 5.2 “Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before God.”— It is but half the verse, but it was the whole of the text, and the discourse was an admonition rather peremptory of the solemn obligations assumed by sponsors in baptism. He said that in this country the parents were permitted to be sponsors—but never, in the Church of England— He dwelt even with vehemence upon the sacred duty of the Sponsor to fulfil the promise to see to the religious instruction of the child, and warned his hearers never to undertake the office, and yet not to decline it when duty qualified for it.

Colton, during the late Presidential canvass a devoted partizan of Henry Clay, and sometime editor of a Newspaper called the true whig, called on me this morning and told me that he was now engaged in the composition of a work to be published in 4. 8vo. volumes, and to be entitled the Life and Times of Henry Clay. That he has been passing the winter at Ashland with Mr Clay, collecting materials for this work, which will be published in numbers of 96 pages each— That the first number was already prepared for the press and would be published very soon— That this number and a part of the second would contain all the personal biography of Mr Clay— That Mr Clay had not been in the habit of keeping copies of his Letters, and that he Colton was therefore under the necessity after of applying to Mr Clay’s correspondents for a sight of the originals, and he thought it probable I might have some such Letters which it might be desirable for him to see— I told Mr Colton that I had a few Letters from Mr Clay, written at different and distant periods of time, and in a very different state of the personal relations between us— That I should cheerfully allow him, Colton to see them all so far as I could collect them— But with regard to certain transactions at Ghent, and to one event during my administration, his duel with John Randolph, there had been a depth of dissension between him and me, which I desired not to disclose to the public, but would wish to be buried in oblivion.— Mr Colton said that Mr Clay would desire nothing which might disturb the friendly relations now subsisting between him and me; and we had an hour or more of full and free conversation which I have neither time space nor inclination here to record— At the house after a sparring debate upon questions of distribution of copies of the great work on the exploring expedition, on motions to reconsider the votes laying on the table the bill for a free bridge over the eastern branch of the Potomack, and the bill for compounding with the sureties of Samuel Swartwout, both of which were lost, the bill for regulating the pay of the army was taken up. The question of its engrossment had been ordered under the screw of the previous question— It was now taken and the bill was ordered to be engrossed— Cave Johnson called for the yeas and nays on the passage of the bill, but forgot to move the previous question— I seized the unsuspected moment and took the floor intending to speak about 5 minutes James A. Black the reporter of the bill called me to order—thinking the previous question yet in operation— The Speaker told him it was not— I spoke at random till the hammer of the Speaker drop’d. "

                "text": "18. IV:5. Tuesday  My speech of yesterday was a random shot. A mere digression; of which with a dozen reporters in the house, no report was made— Stansbury the reporter for the National Intelligencer, and excepting Leavitt the only good one in the house, was in the Senate chamber reporting the Speech of Levi Woodbury for the annexation of Texas— My speech therefore is as if it had never been made— Its only effect was to give rise to that of Kenneth Rayner which was an apology to his constituents for voting against the annexation joint-resolution. James A. Black Chairman of the retrenchment committee who had reported the Bill regulating the pay of the army, and for other purposes without replying either to Rayner or to me moved the previous question, and his bill was passed by yeas and nays 107 to 37. every one knowing that it will not pass the Senate— Three boys Neely, Wise, and Dietz, members of a juvenile debating Society, came to me last Saturday evening with a subscription on paper to purchase a library. I desired them to come again which they did last evening with a small manuscript volume containing a well kept record of their proceedings as a Society. At my request they left this volume with me, and will call again in two or three days. This morning Mr C. Cushing visited me, and left with me the printed Executive message to the Senate of 10. December 1844. containing the Treaty with China. I spoke of the Message to the house which at my motion was referred to the Committee of foreign affairs from which no report upon it has yet been received— I asked Mr Cushing if he knew what the administration proposed in this case to do. He said Mr Calhoun proposed a minister with a 6000 dollars salary— I said it ought to be a full mission of the highest order in our diplomacy— He asked if he might give that as my opinion to the President and Mr Calhoun. I said he might— He will see me again. At the house this day. In Committee of the whole on the state of the Union there was a debate of three hours on a bill appropriating 20000 dollars to refurnish the Presidents house and 8000 dollars for the outhouses and grounds, which in the house was finally rejected by yeas and nays 72 to 80— The civil and diplomatic appropriation bill was then debated in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Saunders in the chair, till half past 5 and then left unfinished.

I read a series of 12 Letters printed in the Boston Atlas, addressed to me on the subject of the annexation of Texas to the United States; well written, though I know not by whom; well reasoned, and conclusive against the measure; but without avail; for it is now apparent that it will be consummated, and is written in the book of Fate— The only insurmountable objection against it, the perfidious robbery and dismemberment of Mexico is lost in the Anarchy and civil War into which precisely at this moment Mexico has fallen— She cannot maintain her own identity— She is falling to pieces, and if Texas were restored to her she could not hold it— The opposition is now confined to the mere mode of making the acquisition, and the question of power will be finally decided by the Will— The Constitution is a menstruous rag, and the Union is sinking into a military monarchy to be rent asunder like the Empire of Alexander or the kingdoms of Ephraim and Judah— At the house even while a quorum was forming, the question was taken on M’Kay’s motion to cease debate in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill, and take it out of Committee at 2. O’Clock to-morrow, and it was carried— Slidell then moved a reconsideration of the vote yesterday rejecting Pratt’s bill appropriating 20000, and 8000 dollars, for refurnishing, and repairing the Presidents house and outhouses and surrounding grounds whereupon the debate of yesterday was rekindled for another term of two hours or more—the vote was reconsidered—the bill redebated, and after abortive motions for the previous question, and to lay the bill on the table, it was again rejected by yeas and nays 75 to 77. many of the whigs not voting at-all.— The house then went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Saunders in the Chair on the civil and diplomatic bill, which was debated till past 5. when the Committee rose, and the house adjourned.— As I was walking home, I met Mr Gilpin and Mr Bancroft, who turned and walked with me to my house and came in and sat down a few minutes. Gilpin was Van Buren’s attorney General, the last half year of his term. Bancroft was his collector at Boston— Three of the boys of the juvenile literary Society came this Evening and took their book. "

The weather is more like summer than winter— On the 4th. 5th. and 6th. of this month there was from the City of New-York eastward to Portland, and westward to the Lakes one of the most tempestuous Snow-storms ever experienced in that region succeeded by the descent of Fahrenheits thermometer to a range from zero to 5— 10— 15— 20 below.— Here we had only one night of a gentle fall of snow, about 4 inches deep, washed and melted away within 48 hours—nor was the thermometer at any time lower than 10 degrees above Zero.— This is one of the most forcible exemplifications of the difference between the winter climate of this place, and that of Boston. In the house Harper obtained with some difficulty, for the Committee on the expenses of the Post-Office Department authority to send for persons and papers— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Saunders in the Chair upon the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill— Two or three points of debate very remotely connected with the objects of the bill were soon started, and were consuming the day when Charles J. Ingersoll moved the Committee to rise, for him to move that every member moving an amendment, should be allowed five minutes for explanation, and the committee should have five minutes to answer him— Then commenced a struggle which consumed an hour, but Ingersoll’s motion finally prevailed— The Committee rose, and with an amendment offered by Owen the five minutes for explanations and five minutes for answer were allowed, till to morrow 3. O’Clock when the bill at all events is to be reported to the house— They then went into Committee again, and E. J. Black of Georgia soon began to rail about the difference between the price of English and American rail-road iron; after a railing match of nearly an hour between him, and Andrew Stewart and Foster, the chairman pronounced him out of order— Rayner appealed and the Chairman was sustained.— A straggling debate on numerous proposed amendments followed, interrupted by a message from the President with a despatch from H. A. Wise about the Brazilian Slave-trade which the Committee rose to receive, and which was referred to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, and then resumed till half past 5 when the Committee rose and the house adjourned— I had morning visits from Heman Lincoln, and from Mr Moody with a young student of the Senior class at Harvard University, who brought me a Letter from the Revd S. K. Lathrop—and a pleasant evening visit from Mr Moseley. "

Pratt, chairman of the Committee on the public buildings proposed three items to the bill for laying the foundation for wings to the Patent Office—to the Treasury building, and to the War and Navy Departments after much discussion, and a ludicrous exhibition of his designs for these buildings to Dromgoole, who objected that no designs had been exhibited he obtained a vote for 80000 dollars for one of the buildings, that for the War and Navy Departments, and chirped like a cricket at having got one of his buildings out of three— Then followed another half hour’s sparring for the rebuilding and furnishing the branch mint at Charlotte, North Carolina; whereupon Daniel M. Barringer gave us an instructive dissertation upon the gold mines of that and the adjoining States of South Carolina and Georgia— The Mint at Charlotte has cost more than it has coined; and has been burnt down.— The Delegates from the territories of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Florida moved amendments each for his own, which were rejected; but the Georgia members carried an item of 20,000 dollars for a Custom house at Savannah— A sweeping item of 72000 dollars, for 8 outfits for all the plenipotentiary missions abroad was carried, after one of 63000 dollars, excepting Brazil had been rejected— C. J. Ingersoll moved an item of 6000 dollars for outfit and 6000 for salary of a minister resident to China— I moved to strike out the word resident and insert plenipotentiary to strike out the two 6000’s and insert 9000’s. Ingersoll accepted my amendment, and it was carried without an opposing voice. Other amendments were proposed, some adopted— Others rejected. About 5 O’Clock the bill was reported to the house—the previous question was called on its engrossment, and the house adjourned. Richard and Mary Cutts were here this evening. "

Saturday  I received this morning a Letter from my son to his mother, dated Wednesday the 19th. with advice that about 12 O’Clock of the preceding night his wife had given birth to a daughter— Their sixth child, and may the blessing of Heaven rest upon them all— Here great preparations are making for what is called a National birth-day Ball next Monday. Intended as a celebration of Washington’s birthday.— But as the festivity will run into the succeeding day to avoid the profanation of the Sabbath, the joyous anniversary is postponed from this day to Monday.— Among other ceremonials to give splendor to the occasion they appointed Committees of the Managers to wait personally on Mrs Madison, Mrs Hamilton and me to invite and escort us to the Ball, and yesterday Mr Evans and Mr Bayard, Senators from the States of Maine and Delaware, called me out from my Seat in the House, and announced to me their mission to tender me the invitation— Which I declined, owing to my age and state of health— I had also received a written invitation from Samuel Humes Porter, and eleven others, a Committee of invitation to an inauguration Ball, to be given on the 4th. of March, which in like manner I have declined— This morning Mr Goodman came, and I took his Social History of Great Britain, during the reign of the Stuarts beginning with the 17th. century, being the period of the Settlement of the United States, in two duodecimo volumes— In the house yesterday I met Albert H. Tracy and Andrew T. Judson, U.S. District judge in Connecticut— I asked him if he had seen C. J Ingersoll’s Report and bill appropriating 70,000 dollars to indemnify the owners of the Schooner Amistad—he said he had— I asked him if he had observed the falsification in the report of the date of the capture of the Amistad by Lieutenant Gedney.— He said he had, and had intended to publish some remarks upon it; but had waited in the expectation that it would be duly exposed in the house— With slight exceptions the whole of this day was consumed in taking questions chiefly by yeas and nays upon the amendments adopted in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill, most of them were confirmed. The most remarkable was the sweeping appropriation of 72000 dollars, or as much thereof as may be necessary, for all the plenipotentiary missions abroad.— The bill was passed— R. D. Owen moved an evening at half past 7. but the proposition was hooted down. "

Mr Daily chaplain of the house preached from Galatians 6.14. first part of the verse— “But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”— He began the discourse by remarking that it was the nature of man to glory in something. Every individual, every community, every Nation glories on something—and it was no uncommon thing for people to glory in their shame— But the only real source of glory was the Cross of Christ— Mr Daily is fond of a fencing bout with infidelity.— He undertook to specify the mistake of infidels who reject the Christian Gospel because they maintain it is inconsistent with reason— It arises from their confounding two distinct ideas—existence, and the cause of existence—the difference between the idea that a thing is—and how it is—for example grass grows—human reason is competent to observe and comprehend this—but how it grows is beyond all human comprehension— Reason is adequate to the observation of the fact; but not to discover the primary cause of the fact—that is a mystery which reason can neither penetrate nor disprove— So of the truths of the Christian Gospel— Reason finds them disclosed in the Bible—but how they exist no human mind can comprehend or disprove— It is the Mystery of the Cross of Christ— Mr Daily did not notice the peculiar character of this epistle to the Galatians, which is merely a controversial argument against the necessity of subjecting the gentile converts to the jewish rite of circumcision.— His valedictory to his auditors was warm and affectionate— After the morning service, Mr William A. Bradley called on me, and gave me a Letter from George W. Slacum late consul of the United States at Rio de Janeiro to him, desiring him to request me to move a call in the House of Representatives, for his correspondence with the Department of State, which he complains has been suppressed, relating to the African Slave-trade— This afternoon at St. John’s Church, Mr Pyne read prayers for the third Sunday in Lent, and preached from Acts 16.30—“what must I do to be saved?” A solemn and momentous question, which he exhorted every one of his hearers to put to himself. It seems to me susceptible of a very simple and easy answer.— Obedience to the will of God—good will to man—true repentance for sin, and active exertion to do good is the unerring path to Salvation— May I not fail to follow it.

Mr Lewis Johnson called on me this morning and enquired if I had seen and conversed with the first comptroller of the Treasury, upon the remnant claim of the Representatives of the late William Otis, on the Treasury— I told him that my time has been so entirely absorbed since he was last here that I had not yet had the opportunity to call upon Mr M’Culloch, and probably shall not have, before the close of the Session of Congress— Immediately after which I would attend to the subject— He gave me to read a Letter from Mr Wolfe the Counsel for the heirs of William Otis at New-Orleans, urging the payment of their proportion to them— The difficulty being that the judge of probate declines issuing Letters of Administration on the Estate of Nathaniel Otis, who on his decease left no assets within his jurisdiction.— Mr Johnson proposes to send to New-Orleans a draft of 50 dollars to serve as assets upon which the judge may issue Letters of Administration, which will authorise him to pay the portion due to the heirs at New-Orleans— At the house the day was almost entirely consumed in a struggle, to pass per saltum, a bill for reducing the rates of postage, received from the Senate— There is in all the free States a loud popular clamour for a great reduction of the postage of Letters; and it has taken a deep hold of the candidates for popular favour, and votes in those parts— The Sectional interests of North and South, are in conflict with each other in this case— The Committee of Post-Offices and Post roads, had reported a Bill in the house, to reform of the Postage, but it fell far short of the bill from the Senate— M’Kay had given notice on Saturday that he should this day move to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the army and navy appropriation bills.— He moved accordingly to go into Committee this morning, and they did so— But they refused to take up his army bill, and took up the Postage bill from the Senate.— Hopkins moved to substitute the house Bill in its place— But Rathbun moved the Committee to rise for a resolution to take the House bill out of Committee in ten minutes— The Committee rose, and Hamlin of Maine made the ten minutes motion, but it kindled a blaze of Such ignation from the South that he soon flinched and extended the time for debate in Committee to two hours. The Northern and Southern democracy, battled it all day; but the North finally prevailed to take the bill out of Committee, after two hours of debate to morrow.— Shepherd Cary, by a small stratagem got an additional hour for himself and W.

Slacum late Consul of the United States at Rio de Janeiro, with the Department of State, relating to the African Slave trade.— The Speaker after putting me off two or three times, said my motion could only be received by the unanimous consent of the house— Thompson of Mississippi objected— I intreated him to withdraw his objection, observing that it was a mere call of enquiry and there were so few days of the Session left that unless the call should be immediately made there would be no chance of receiving an answer to it— Thompson rather ungraciously slackened his objection, the Speaker put the question upon my Resolution, and it was adopted without opposition; a great multitude of reports were received and disposed of. M’Kay moved that the house would daily to the end of the Session take a recess from half past 2 to half past 4 take a recess, but they refused— When the Postage bill came up, Cobb of Georgia and Yancey of Alabama, occupied 3/4 of the two hours all in opposition to the Bill, and Amasa Dana, one short half hour in its favour— Causin was cut short in five minutes— The Bill was read by sections, but the number of captions and senseless amendments was so teazing that when the they had only reached the ninth Section out of 23. the Committee rose for lack of a Quorum; and Douglas moved to discharge the Committee from all further consideration, and the Bill and bring it with the amendments adopted before the house for its immediate action— This after a hard and convulsive struggle was carried; and after abortive motions to lay the bill on the table, for a call of the house and to adjourn, the previous question on the passage of the bill was carried, and at half past 7 the house adjourned.

Another tumultuary day of confusion as all those that follow will be to the close of the Session of Congress.— This was the weekly day for the meeting of the select Committee on the memorials of the American statistical Association, and the Massachusetts Medical Society upon the errors of the 6th census; but only three members of the Committee attended the meeting, and there was no quorum.— They agreed to adjourn without day, and leave me to ask to be discharged from the further consideration of the memorials. Mr Stiles said there was a report from the Department of State, in answer to a Resolution offered by him on this subject, but which has not yet been published. At the house two successive motions were made to dispense with the reading the journal, but single members objecting the reading was continued and completed— The two amendments adopted to the Postage bill in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union were confirmed by yeas and nays in the house— After an agonizing struggle the bill was passed 128 to 74.— Thompson of Mississippi moved to amend the title of the bill, to read— [“]An Act to make Post-Office Department a nuisance, and to guaranty the tariff law of 1842.” objection was made to this motion as not in order, being disrespectful to the house— The Speaker decided it was in order, and referred to the precedent of a motion by C. Cushing at the passage of the sub-treasury-bill— Upon this motion Thompson commenced a bitter speech on the details of the bill—he was called to order three or four times by different members, but the Speaker every time pronounced him in order till Stetson of New-York reminded him of an adverse decision by himself at this very session— Thompson finally desisted by the advice of some of his own party— Houston immediately called up the motion to reconsider the vote by which his land graduation bill was laid on the table—but the house by yeas and nays 81 to 97 refused the reconsideration. M’Kay moved to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union— Carried. Linn Boyd in the chair M’Kay moved to take up the army appropriation Bill, lost 73 to 75— Jameson moved to take up the river improvement bill—carried— By invitation of J. P. Kennedy I went over and dined with him and his fellow lodgers, at Mrs Whitwell’s from half past 3 to five, while the house was in Session. Returned and found them still engaged with the river bill, inglorious confusion. They adjourned at 1/2 past 7 to 10 to-morrow morning. "

Andrews our Coachman to come for me at half past 2, intending to go home to dine while the house were in Session, and return after dinner—but when he came there was a succession of yeas and nays taken merely to waste the time; but upon which every vote might be vital, and I could not be absent— There was a call of the house ordered before a quorum could be formed; and I had answered to the call of my name when it was found that a quorum were present; and then further proceedings were superseded— The River and Harbour Bill was immediately taken up, and Tibbatts moved an entire Bill as a substitute, differing just enough from that which he offered before and which failed to be brought within the rules of order.— Then came a swarm of motions for amendments to Tibbatts’s substitute most of which were rejected and a few were adopted.— After three hours of chaotic confusion Belser of Alabama moved to lay the Bill on the table— Lost by yeas and nays 80 to 97.— After some time the question was taken upon Tibbatts’s amendment; which was lost 89 to 96— Then sundry other amendments were proposed and rejected— Foot of Vermont finally moved a reconsideration of the vote rejecting Tibbatts’s substitute, which after much chicanery was carried, upon a motion of John W. Davis, but before six O’Clock the house adjourned without taking the final question upon the bill— We had visits this evening from Mr. Mrs and Miss Ruggles, and Mrs Tighe of New-York, with Mr Moseley, the member of the house.— Mr Ruggles who is one of the ablest and best men of that State is going with his family upon a tour of Europe for fourteen months of this and the next year— Judge Kent (son of the chancellor) who has recently resigned his seat on the State Bench goes with Mr Ruggles. The Senate this Evening by a vote of 27 to 25. adopted the Resolutions of the House of Representatives, for admitting Texas as a State into this Union—with two additional Resolutions giving the President an alternative, as to the manner of consummating this transaction— This addition was proposed by Robert J. Walker, Senator from Mississippi, and is in substance the plan of Thomas H. Benton. It is a signal triumph of the Slave representation in the Constitution of the United States. "

V:30 Friday  The day passes and leaves scarcely a distinct trace upon the memory of any thing, and precisely because among numberless other objects of comparative insignificance, the heaviest calamity that ever befel myself and my country was this day consummated.— Immediately after the meeting of the house, the Joint Resolutions of the house for the admissions of Texas as a State into this Union, were returned from the Senate with an amendment consisting of two additional resolutions— A motion was made to supersede the reading of the Journal, but objection was made, and the journal was read— I presented the report of the joint committee of the Legislature of Massachusetts, by Mr Bell, and the Resolutions of the Legislature concerning the annexation of Texas to the United States, and they were received— The River and harbour bill was taken up at the stage where it was last left, and after several of the amendments adopted in Committee of the whole were rejected Tibbatts’s substituted bill was carried by yeas and nays 102 to 92—and passed 106 to 95.— M’Kay moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the army and navy appropriation bills, but the Texas-Resolutions had not yet been referred to that Committee and the house refused to go into Committee 82 to 107.— So the report of Burke’s Committee on the Rhode-Island Resolutions came up for the morning hour— Elmer finished the Speech which he had begun against the report the last time it was before the house; and Henry Williams made a Speech to sustain the report— Then after another struggle to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union which the majority inflexibly refused until the Texas Resolutions were referred to that Committee— They were referred and after many fruitless efforts to delay their passage were forced through without the allowance of any debate and with stubborn rejection of every proposed amendment. I took in this transaction save that of silent voting.— I regard it as the apoplexy of the Constitution.— The final vote of concurrence with the amendment of the Senate was 132 to 76— After which on M’Kay’s motion the house resolved itself into a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and crowded through the Navy Appropriation Bill alternating at pleasure between the Committee with Duncan in the Chair, and the house with Hopkins, Weller and Linn Boyd by turns, the Speaker Jones being indisposed— The army appropriation bill came next and was squeezed along to its last lines till the quorum failed and at 10. P.M. the house adjourned. "

He said it was probably one of the last votes he should ever give in the house— He is one of those who in the commission of crimes think they are doing God service— He represents about 80,000 slaves— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, M’Clelland in the chair, the bill for establishing new Post-Offices was taken up, loaded with a number of amendments, reported to the House and passed Then Committee of the whole on the state of the Union again, Hannibal Hamlin chairman, and the Army appropriation Bill was taken up where it had slumped last night. Lucas, the member from the District in which is the Harper’s ferry armoury moved to strike out the item of 200000 dollars for the manufacture of arms, and insert 360000—he had polled a large majority of the Committee for it, but there was no quorum present— Hamlin the chairman pronounced the amendment carried— I remonstrated against such a reckless waste of the public money and made Hamlin revoke his decision—and compelled the adjournment for want of a quorum— This morning Winthrop came and told me that half this money was wanted for the Springfield armoury, and that the item of 360000 dollars was the estimate from the War Department which M’Kay, and the Committee of Ways and Means had cut down.— Lucas and Harper’s ferry however carried the increased appropriation this morning through the Committee first, and then by yeas and nays through the house, 85 to 75— The army appropriation bill with sundry other incumbrances was passed—and also an amendment of the Senate to the bill for reducing postage The house took a recess from 3 to half past 4 O’Clock during which I came home and dined— Then went back and sat till half past ten—and then adjourned to ten O’Clock Monday Morning— The Senate this day passed the Bill from the House for admitting Iowa, and Florida as States into the Union— "

O’Clock this morning. But he did not arrive. Mr Tuston the chaplain performed the usual services for the last Lord’s day of the Session, and preached a short Sermon of nearly three quarters of an hour, from Acts 16.30. the last words of the verse—“what must I do, to be saved?” a singular coincidence with the discourses of Mr Pyne— Mr Tuston said nothing very impressive upon the subject of his text—but his address was an affectionate and grateful valedictory to his congressional auditory. He has been for six successive Sessions the chaplain of the Senate, and takes pride in the acknowledgment that he has during all that time been treated with undeviating respect and kindness, by all the members of both houses of Congress— As a second exercise we had an address in behalf of Sailors from the Revd. Mr Dennison the Colleague of father Taylor who travels to obtain subscribers for a Sailor Newspaper called the Sheet Anchor— Mr Dennison is not quite so methodical, or so various of topics as Mr Colton, and still less so than Mr Taylor. He touched upon the peculiarities of the Sailors character— The dangers of the Seas, of the rocks and of the shores—the sudden and dreadful vicissitudes to which he is exposed, and the extraordinary learning of some common seaman, one of whom he once heard dispute upon the bible in seven different languages. There was earnest exhortation to promote the temperance reform among the Seamen, and to abolish the Spirit ration in the Navy.— The hall was crowded, and the galleries well occupied— Very few members of Congress were in attendance—among them was Henry Johnson, Senator from Louisiana, who accompanied Mrs Hamilton, the widow of Alexander Hamilton, in the 90th. year of her age, who has been passing the winter here with the manuscript papers of her eminent husband for sale to Congress—encouraged by their purchase of those of Washington and of Madison— Johnson introduced me to her— She said she had known my father and mother— After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Pyne read the Evening service, and for the 4th. Sunday in Lent, and preached a second Sermon upon the text from Acts 16.30. “What must I do to be saved?[”] An elaborate, ingenis, earnest, close, argument for the indispensable necessity of a saviour, for man conscious of sin, and of his utter inability to save himself— Odi et arceo— It cannot be, the more this doctrine is pressed upon me, the more my soul stiffens against it.

Among them the blow up between Cave Johnson and Romulus M. Saunders, rival candidates for the Office of Post-master general, and the triumph of Cave sympathetic with his triumph as a candidate. So much for Post-Office patronage— Owen and Burke made desperate attempts to force down a swindling Smithsonian Bill, which I barely succeeded in defeating. M’Kay by a knavish trick strangled an appropriation of 40000 dollars for a sea wall to preserve the great Brewster— President Tyler vetoed a Bill prohibiting payment for certain armed steamers for which he had contracted without Law— He sent the Bill back to the Senate, which upon reconsideration passed the bill with only one opposing vote— It came to the house, and was there passed again 126 to 31— The first Law passed in defiance of the veto precisely as Midnight came— Adjourned at 3.

Tuesday  Inauguration of James Knox Polk as P.U.S.  The day after the closing scene of a dying Congress reminds me of what is said of Typhon in the Asiatic Seas, and of a West India hurricane, when it often happens that the transition from the most terrific fury of the tempest to a dead and breathless calm is instantaneous— Such is the change of ones personal existence between the whirlwind of yesterday, and the tranquility of this day— There was an unusual degree of pomposity paraded in the inauguration of James Knox Polk as President of the United States, by the democracy but I witnessed nothing of it— A Committee of arrangements, for the reception and inauguration of the President elect had been appointed by the Senate consisting of Levi Woodbury of New-Hampshire, Sidney Breese of Michigan, and Walter T. Colquitt of Georgia, all rank democrats, who in a very polite note, enclosed to me, three printed copies of the arrangements, with a notification that a position had been assigned to the Ex-Presidents which the committee would be happy to have me occupy. I did not avail myself of the invitation— There was a procession of 10 or 11. military companies who escorted Mr Polk and Mr Tyler, who rode together, in an open carriage, from Coleman’s National Hotel to the Capitol—They first assembled in the Senate, chamber where George Mifflin Dallas, Vice-President elect was qualified as President of the Senate, and whence they proceeded to a platform protruding from the portico at the top of the flight of stairs ascending the eastern front to the entrance of the Rotundo— There Mr Polk delivered his inaugural address—half an hour long, to a large assemblage of umbrella’s for it was raining hard all the time— The official oath was then administered to him by Chief Justice Taney, and the draggle-tail procession thinned in numbers escorted him back to the President’s house— At night there were two balls, one at Carusi’s hall, at 10 dollars a ticket of all parties—the other of pure democrats at 5 dollars a ticket at the National Theatre— Mr Polk attended both but supped with the true blue 5 dollar democracy.— My family and myself received invitations to both but attended neither— A young man (I forget his name) came and asked me for a copy of my oration upon La Fayette for a friend of his in New-York, which I gave him— He gave me a copy of the inaugural address at which he had been part of the time present I took this afternoon a short solitary walk— Richard D.

Conflagration of the National Theatre—  Numerous visitors this day none of whose names except that of Mr Johnson, I remember absorbed my time so that I could not even redeem the arrears of the last three days in this Diary— Mr Lewis Johnson came to relieve me from the trouble of calling again upon Mr M’Culloh the Comptroller to convince him of the justice of the remnant of claim of the Estate of William Otis, for that last Monday morning he had promised a member of the Senate of the United States, a lawyer 500 dollars to get the claim through on that day which he had done, not only by pressure upon the accounting Officers of the Treasury, but by two personal visits to the then acting President John Tyler, from whom he obtained a written order for the allowance of the claim, which passed through all the offices on that day. Mr Johnson said he had not yet received the money, but it was ready for him at the Treasury, and when paid he would tell me, who this Senator Lawyer is—he had paid him the stipulated 500 dollars, and found him greedy for more I guess his name. I rode with my wife and Mary to the Capitol, where they left me— I found some documents at the Clerks Office, and met John W. Jones, late Speaker, M’Kay and Cobb in the Post-Office— I had voted against the thanks to Jones— The testimony to his impartiality was too broad a lie for me to swallow. But I shook hands with him now— As I did with M’Kay, and told him it was to part with him forever—for his baseness in defeating the appropriation of 40000 dollars for a seawall in Boston Harbour. President Polk this day nominated James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, Secretary of State Robert J. Walker of Mississippi, Secretary of the Treasury, William L. Marcy of New-York Secretary of War, George Bancroft of Massachusetts, Secretary of the Navy, John Y. Mason of Virginia Attorney General, and Cave Johnson of Tennessee, Postmaster General— They were all confirmed by the Senate except Bancroft whose nomination was laid over— An entire new Cabinet at the accession of a new President without a reverse of politics, is a novelty under the present Constitution. Rumours of it have been in circulation for some weeks which I did not believe. I doubted especially the removal of the Secretary of State, John C. Calhoun, and even now cannot account for it—or for the tame complacency with which the Senate confirmed this day all the nominations but one— This Evening as I came up to my chamber after tea, I found it illuminated with a blaze of light from the National theatre with nothing between it and us, but the opposite side of the Street. It burnt down, with five or six dwelling houses, and several other buildings before midnight— God of Mercy!— Mercy! "

                "text": "6. VI. Thursday.  The fire of the theatre, and adjoining houses was subdued before I retired to bed last Night, but the ruins were yet smoking when I rose this morning— The theatre had been the night before the scene of a magnificent democratic inauguration Ball; and when it took fire they were with a full house in the midst of the performance of a comedy. Walter Hellen was there— All the company however escaped from the house, and not a life was lost— I was brooding over the calamities of human suffering, by the unbridled element of physical nature in fire, when I received by this morning Mail, a printed pamphlet intitled Statement of Francis Thomas, exhibiting a tale of woe, sprung from the vices and animal propensities of the species, more terrible than destruction by fire— Thomas was a distinguished democratic member of the House of Representatives from the 22d. to the 26th. Congress inclusive— In March 1841 he retired from Congress— On the 8th. of June of that year was married to Sarah M’Donnel, daughter of the Governor of Virginia, and in December of the same year was elected by the People of Maryland Governor of that State for 3. years which expired last December— The torture of the infernal regions is Paradise in comparison with the condition in which he by his own narrative he has lived from the 21st of July 1841. only six weeks after his marriage— He has suffered an excessive load of public odium from which he now appeals by this Statement— It is dark if not fatal to the reputation of the Lady.— An irresistible interest attached me to the pamphlet which I read through, and which consumed the leisure of the day— I had a long conversation with Mr Samuel A. Turner of Scituate, here I suppose as a speculator for public office under the new administration. I gave him freely my opinions upon the present condition and prospects of the country— He avowed no opposite opinion; but concurred in a faint-hearted tone, willing to retain the credit of the sentiment, and the liberty to maintain its opposite counterpart elsewhere— Mr Thomas Lawrence an aged Quaker from New-York, with his friend named William Kimball Hoyt, visited me for purposes of benevolence; and Mr Sykes a member of the house of Representatives from New Jersey in the late Congress, with Mr and Mrs Moore, I believe Quakers, from that State. 2d. Lieutenant Z. B. Tower of the Corps of topographical engineers, now stationed at Old Point comfort was also here; and Mr Winthrop and Mr Grinnell, to take leave; departing this afternoon by the Railway Cars for home. They leave Mr Bates the Senator dangerously ill. "

Mr Lewis Johnson came this morning and told me the sequel of the negotiation of last Monday for the recovery of the remnant of claim upon the treasury of the legal representatives of William Otis deceased— He said he had yesterday received 8612 dollars and 12 cents— That the Senator lawyer was William D. Merrick by the magic of whose eloquence, on the last day of the administration of John Tyler, and of his own service as a member of the Senate of the United States, a written order from Mr Tyler to the accounting officers of the Treasury to allow this sum on that day was obtained—the fruit of two personal visits of Mr Merrick to Mr Tyler on the same day— Two years will next June have passed during which has Mr Johnson been urging the allowance of this claim, aided with all the legal abilities of two eminent lawyers Fendall and Moffitt. I have twice visited the first comptroller M’Culloh to impress it upon his sense of justice, in vain— Mr Merrick for a fee of 500 dollars obtained it in one day— Mr M’Culloh the first Comptroller did not disguise his reluctance to sign the order. Mr John Underwood Chief Clerk of the first Auditor who had thoroughly examined the claim and was strongly prejudiced against was still more averse to its allowance; but the order was obeyed I said the claim was just, and I was glad it had been allowed and paid— But I should have been more rejoyced if it had been more regularly allowed. He said Mr Merrick did not consider it irregular; he had given a receipt for the 500 dollars, and had expressed a lively desire for more, particularly for the odd 112 dollars and 12 cents over the 8000 dollars— He had thought himself fully justified in resorting to this expedient frequently used for the settlement of accounts at the Treasury, and much more efficacious than any accumulation of vouchers.— He would however thank me to consider what he had said to me as confidential— I told him I should not be indiscreet— But this is the key to Merrick’s Texas annexation vote— The premium pudicitiae.— A Mr John Peter Johnson came with a Quarto Volume of Hinton’s history of the United States an American improved edition by Mr Choules. I declined taking it— Mr Leavenworth is a mail contractor from Indiana, originally from Massachusetts— He has a claim before Congress— Mr Mason came for a paper which he had enclosed to me, which I have made— Mr Colton spent the evening here.

I am endeavouring to pass into a regular and orderly course of life for useful occupation of my time; but my purposes are still baffled by frequent visitors, and by daily pamphlets and newspapers which seize my attention and with the calls for bodily exercise in the open air, swing by the hour till the approach to midnight summons me to bed with warning: that I am one day nearer to the close of life and with the still recurring cry of conscience that I have lost a day. John Woolley is a tinplate workman from New-Jersey— In 1813 he enlisted for 5 years as a private soldier in the U.S. army, and in May 1815 was discharged as unfit for service by reason of chronic rhumatism— He has long been a complainant and claimant under the pension Laws— Until February or March 1844, his testimony was deficient to the fact that his disability was contracted by his military service. He then produced it and obtained from Secretary Wilkins, a pension certificate of 3 fourths disability, 6 dollars a month— But J. L. Edwards the Commissioner of Pensions allows his pension to run only from the time when he completed his proof last March—which is the law— He claims arrears from May 1815. when he was discharged about 2160 dollars, and he came with all his papers to me, for a certificate that if they had been exhibited to me when I was President I would have ordered the allowance of his claim— I declined and told him that on the face of his papers the decision of Mr Edwards had been strictly conformable to law— He said he had been to Mr Marcy, the new Secretary of War, who told him that he would examine his papers, and if he found his claim just would direct its allowance— Mr Calvin Mason came for the paper which I had mislaid— After long and repeated searches I had found it, and returned it to him— Mr John Pope and Mr Moody were here— Mr Pope was a member of the house from Kentucky in the 25th. 26th. and 27th. Congresses. He lost his election for the 28th.— He comes now to greet the new administration of James K. Polk, and has a prospect of returning as he came.— Mr Pope is a worthy and amiable ambitious man; an old and faithful public servant, but a timid, wavering and unreliable politician— I called at the National Intelligencer Office to look at my list of Petitions not yet printed while I was out Mr and Mrs Roosevelt were here— After dinner I took another short walk round the Presidents square— Mr Colton the Editor of the American Review was here again this evening, and had a long conversation with me upon general topics political— His zeal is abundant, his knowledge scanty. His need of assistance more urgent than promising— Mr Masters son of Mrs. Masters of Hamilton New-York was here last Wednesday— On the look out— "

                "text": "9. V:30. Sunday.  I attended public worship this morning at St. John’s Church where Mr Pyne read the morning prayers for the 5th. Sunday in Lent and preached from Matthew John 9.6. [“]When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. 7. And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation sent) He went his way, therefore, and washed, and came, seeing.” I was perplexed in the effort to trace any connection between this text and the discourse which followed upon it—which was a very earnest and argumentative exhortation upon the duty of joining in communion with the church. In commenting upon the text Mr Pyne’s first remark was of a peculiarity in the performance of this miracle differing from most if not from all the others performed by Jesus— In healing the man sick of the palsy—in raising Lazarus from the dead it was by a word— Take up thy bed, and walk— Lazarus came forth— Here it was by action, having no apparent relation, between the act and the result—the restoration of sight to the blind man— Mr Pyne urged it as a lesson to abstain from irreverent scrutinies into the manner and agencies by which the miracles were performed— In this case an intense curiosity was excited—the man himself upon whom the miracle was performed was taken before the magistrates and examined; as were his Parents— They answered enquiries only by referring to him— He referred only to facts, and reply to objectors and accusers only said I was blind— I see.— The lesson is ingeniously drawn, but how the duty of joining in communion with the church is drawn from it, I do not see. After the morning service Mr Barnard called on us to take leave— He is to go with his family to morrow afternoon for his home at Albany— He retires from Congress, having declined a re-election, and has not left a wiser or better behind.— His character is grave his deportment courteous but dignified; conscious of his own intellectual pre-eminence, and not condescending to conceal his aversion to the base or his contempt for the stupid— If I ever return here again I shall deeply lament his absence— After dinner I attended at the second Presbyterian Church— Mr Knox was in the pulpit, but all the services were performed by a stranger—quite a young man He preached from Matthew 12.30. the first part of the verse— “He that is not with me, is against me[”]— Not deficient in fluency; the discourse was not remarkable for much beside. He prayed with great fervour for the restoration of Mr Knox’s health, and the resumption of his ministerial exercises— Whence and from his emaciated form and pallid face I perceived that he had been severely indisposed, which I had not before heard— Coll. George T. Bigelow of Boston spent part of the Evening with us, and Mrs Talbot with her Son and daughter the remainder— Coll Bigelow brought a Letter from our Son. Theodore Talbot was on Lieutenant Fremonts expedition. "

Rainy day— I am now but just beginning a week after the close of the Session of Congress, to assort and file and assort my Letters and papers received during the Session, and ascertain which of them have been neglected or overlooked, and may yet be attended to or answered— I found a printed Letter from Eliab Kingman to the town of Medway dated New-York, July 1844. informing them that he had found their name in the Report of the Register of the Treasury, showing the unclaimed dividend, on the old unfunded debt of U.S. and the outstanding certificates of the unfunded debt—and offering to receive the money for them, and pay it over to their order deducting his commission, if they will send him executed a power of Attorney of which he sends them a copy. This printed Letter I received some weeks since from M. M. Fisher of Medway in a Letter from him which is mislaid, asking my attention to it— I took it this morning to the Office of Michael Nourse, chief clerk to the Register of the Treasury.— The Document is N. 36.— 28. Congress 1. Session. 6. Jany 1844—where on a Statement A. of unclaimed dividends due at the treasury, upon treasury and loan Office books, at page 35. the town of Medway stands credited for 3 dollars 68 cents; which Mr Nourse said would be paid upon the production of a power of Attorney to receive it, executed by the Treasurer of that town— I called also at the Bank of the Metropolis and deposited the order of the Speaker of the late H.R.U.S. for 513 dollars 60 cents—the balance of my pay for service as a member of the house, 92 days and 472 miles of travel each way— My wife had last evening invited Coll. Bigelow to dine with us this day, but he did not come— I called at the National Hotel, (Coleman’s) and at the United States Hotel (Tyler’s) to see him, but he was not at either— I called also at Mrs Whitwell’s to enquire of the state of Mr Isaac C. Bates, Senator from Massachusetts, who from the Night of Friday 28 February has been lying dangerously ill with a fever— His Son came to the door of the Carriage, and said that his attending physician Dr Sewall thought him this day better, but still in a critical state— I went to the Office of the Clerk of the House for sheets of the Journals, and for certain public documents, but found there only Mr Buck, and the Document rooms closed— Mr Fendall spent part of the evening here. He came to inform me that the criminal court of the City was now again in Session and to enquire when it would suit my convenience to attend as a witness, in the case of Captain Sangster— I told him, any day this week. I had a long conversation with him upon the present state of public affairs— He talked with cautious reserve, being yet U.S. District Attorney and not knowing how soon he may be removed— The nomination of George Bancroft as Secretary of the Navy was this day confirmed by the Senate.

Congress that I have been able to employ my time in regular occupation.— In the process of assorting and filing my papers I found two Letters from William Whiting Roxbury, one dated 16. December 1844. enclosing a declaration of Jane Cheney, widow of Thomas Cheney a revolutionary pensioner, and a power of Attorney from her to Meserve to receive the pension due to her on the 6th. of September last— The other 6. March current reminding me of the former Letter and enclosure, and enquiring about the additional half years pension just then payable— Also a long Letter and previous correspondence of James Gregory of Marblehead, for a pension in behalf of Sarah Reynolds once widow of William Follett alledged to have been a Midshipman of the Boston Frigate, Captain Samuel Tucker until she sailed from Boston harbour on the 13th. of February 1778. and on the next day from Marblehead for France— I took all these papers to the Commissioner of Pensions James L. Edwards, who told me that the pension of Mrs Cheney for both half years would be paid, on presentation of her declaration and power of Attorney to Meserve, at Boston— As to the claim of Mrs Sarah Reynolds I read to Mr Edwards the material parts of Mr Gregory’s Letter to me, and stated that I could testify to the fact that the frigate Boston sailed from that harbour on the 13th. of February 1778. and put in to the harbour of Marblehead for a Seaman or Seamen, though I could not pledge my memory to the name of Follett— I left the papers with Mr Edwards who promised carefully to review the case and inform me of the result.— This afternoon Mr Hague the Astrologer from Philadelphia called on me and told me he had come to cast the nativities of the new great men, just now mounted on the political stage— He said he had seen Mr Pakenham and found him very polite and condescending. He was very desirous of visiting General Almonte the late Mexican Minister who is about taking his departure, in consequence of the passage of the Texas-annexation Resolutions. Mr Hague asked me the day and hour of the birth of my Son, which I told him— He said that for the last six or eight month Saturn had cross’d the path of my celestial Stars, and asked me, if I had not been visited with an unusual troubles and afflictions. I said I had not been without them, nor without cheering consolations. But that in the January number of his Horoscope he had prophesied Afflictions to me, from my wife and children, by this passage of Saturn across my path and I would thank him not to foretel any more from the same cause— Sickness or disastrous casualties were the only troubles that Saturn could inflict upon me through my wife and children, and they would be distressing enough if they should come— It was no pleasant pastime to anticipate them. He said he would not predict them any more, and that my horoscope was fair for 7 years. "

When he first came, I had not money to pay the bill, and asked him to call again— This morning I paid the bill, and was surprized on seeing his receipt John Quincy Adams for J. Joyce— I asked him how he came by my name— He said I was in the house at Rossburg when he was born in 1817. and that my name was given to him for that reason— I knew nothing of it at the time or it had escaped from my Memory. On the last Night of the late Session of Congress close upon midnight Samuel F. Vinton an able and excellent member of the House from Ohio came to my seat and shewed me a printed Letter signed in manuscript by M. Bartly, Governor of Ohio dated Columbus 6. February 1845. transmitting Resolutions of the Legislature of Ohio, printed on the other leaf of the sheet, and rescinding certain Resolutions of censure passed upon me by a former Legislature of the State in 1842. The rescinding resolution is preceded by a complimentary preamble, and an additional Resolution requests the Governor to forward copies of the preamble and Resolutions to each of the Reprentatives in Congress from the State, as he might think proper, with a request that they be laid before the House of Representatives Mr Vinton thought it was too late for that in which I fully concurred.— Alexander Harper of Zanesville, another worthy member from the State, afterwards came and shewed me the copy of the same document which he had received, and Robert C. Schenk of Dayton gave me the one that he had received— The next morning I received under a blank cover, directed to me, without postmark a copy of the same document, but it was addressed to John B. Weller, the very gall-bladder of the delegation from Ohio— I enclosed it under a cover, and sent it to his lodgings at Brown’s Hotel— I took to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and gave to Mr Gales for publication the closing sheets of the list of Petitions, Memorials and Remonstrances presented by me to the House of Representatives during the recent Session. We received morning visits from Commodore and Mrs. Morris and from the Chevalier Hülsemann the Chargé d’Affaires from Austria— This afternoon Hague the Astrologer came with a man who he said was his agent to sell his horoscopes.— He whispered also mysteriously that he had seen General Almonte, Mr Pakenham, Mr Fox, and Mr Buchanan—that many things were going on of which the Senate knew nothing, and he within four or five days would tell me all about it.— Robert Owen came and took leave of me— Miss Cutts here.

Visitors this day Francis Sommerauer a German, who enlisted in our army as a private soldier; became an invalid by exposure and was discharged— Not coming precisely within the provisions of the Pension Laws, he petitioned Congress at the late Session, and a bill granting him a full pension passed the house, but not reached in the Senate. He came now as a solicitor for charity. Mrs Fairfield, mother of the late Sumner Lincoln Fairfield came with a subscription paper for a small volume of his poems— He died some months since in great indigence at New-Orleans, leaving a widow and three small children— Mr Joshua Dodge, twice during the administration of John Tyler, agent for the tobacco planters in Germany, was here, and Archibald Campbell, civil engineer employed by the Government at Pittsburgh. I called at Mr Moody’s house to visit him and Mr John Pope; but neither of them was at home. At the Patent Office I applied to the Commissioner Henry L. Ellsworth, for the Ivory cane made from a single tooth, presented to me by Julius Pratt and Co. of Meriden, Connecticut, and which on the 23d. of April last I deposited in the Patent Office.— There is on the top of the cane a golden Eagle inlaid, bearing a scroll With the Motto “Right of Petition Triumphant” engraved upon it— The donors requested of me, that when the gag rule should be rescinded I would cause the date to be added to the motto, which I promised to do if the Event should happen in my lifetime— Mr Ellsworth sent the cane to my house. There is a gold ring immediately below the pommel of the cane, thus engraved  I crave pardon for the vanity of this memorial— Mr Ellsworth told me that Edmund Burke of New Hampshire had attempted to get him displaced on the plea that he favoured the home interest— I had heard that Burke had a Shark-like appetite for the office, himself— My next call was at the General Post-Office, where I found Mr Cave Johnson installed as Postmaster General. Judge Catron was with him, but immediately withdrew. The supreme Court adjourned on Wednesday the 6th. instt. and judge Catron told me that judge Wayne was gone home— I read to Mr Johnson the Letter which I had lately received from Minott Thayer, of Braintree respecting the Post Offices there; and left it with him— He said he would notify me of the result— I stop’d at the Office of the National Intelligencer to enquire of Mr Gales, if he had heard this day, of Mr Isaac C. Bates who lies at the point of death, at Mrs. Whitwell’s. He had not— Short walk between Sunset and dark— Mr John C.

Friday  Mr Levering came and took leave of me—going to Baltimore to-morrow and intending to embark in April for England— He asked for a Letter of introduction, which he had several times before requested, and which I had promised to give him. I wrote one to Thomas Aspinwall our Consul at London, and sent it to him at his lodgings.— I have several tasks of private business on hand, for the performance of which I waited till the close of the Session of Congress, and which I now procrastinate from day to day. The most that I can accomplish is to dispose of one or two of them every day. I wrote this day to M. M. Fisher at Medway to inform him that there is on the books of the Register of the Treasury, a sum of 3 dollars 68 cents due to that town— I called first at Mr Frye’s Office, and afterwards at his house, and read to him a Letter received, from Thomas S. Whitaker 10. March—New-York, and which I am required to answer. I consulted with Mr Frye, who will make the necessary enquires, and inform me of the result— Mr Campbell dined and took tea with us—  On the 2d. of January last I received a Letter from Benjamin S. Cowen, then a member of the House of Representatives of the State of Ohio, dated Columbus 30 December 1844. informing me in terms of great kindness that he had that day had the pleasure of voting for a resolution, rescinding the resolution of censure which had passed upon me in the Legislature of the same State in February 1842., for having presented the Haverhill petition. Mr Cowen was at that time a member of Congress from Ohio.— He mentioned in his Letter to me that the Resolution of censure was a joint resolution of the two houses— That the rescinding Resolution was introduced into the house by a young member from Portage County named Payne, and that it must go to the Senate.— On the 26th. of February last I received a Letter from R. F. Paine himself dated Columbus 21. February 1845. informing me that his rescinding Resolution had that day passed the Senate by a vote of 21 to 15— He speaks of the indignation which he had felt at the passage of the Resolution of censure, and of the determination he had then formed, if he should ever have the opportunity, to get it rescinded, and he enquires whether if I should reply to his Letter, I should be willing to have the correspondence published?— This proposal suggested to me the idea of reviewing the transactions connection with my presentation of the Haverhill Petition, in the nature of a deposition in perpetuam rei memoriam, and for that purpose began last Tuesday my answer to Mr Paine to which I have devoted ten days, and for which I need above all the daily admonitions of a cool and friendly Mentor.

To sooth my conscience with the semblance of something like doing business, I called this morning at the Treasury Department and enquired of the chief-Clerk, M’Clintock Young concerning an Act of the recent Session, for the relief of John Adams and John Adams junr. owners of the Schooner Abigail of Provincetown, Massachusetts— Mr Young informed me that it would be necessary for me to write to the Secretary of the Treasury, now Robert J. Walker, requesting the remittance to be made. Mr W. Cost Johnson was with Mr Young— And a crowd of suitors in the entry— I rode to Mrs Whitwell’s on the Capitol Hill, and enquired concerning Mr Bates— A young man came to the door of the carriage, and said he was no better, and not expected to survive this day.— I went to the Capitol, dismissed the Carriage, and with the aid of Mr Buck, the only person whom I found in the Office of the Clerk of the House, hunted up the petition of Benjamin Eggleston, presented in 1842 and on which was endorsed, adverse Report— The Report is from the Committee of claims 20 May 1842— Two days after the close of the recent Session of Congress, I found among the papers on my table a bound octavo Volume of 464 pages, the title of which was An American Field of Mars, &c. in 3. Volumes of which this was the first—by Benjamin Eggleston—printed at Cleveland 1839.— Within the book was pasted on the cover was a written note that the two subsequent volumes were yet in manuscript, and a long Letter addressed to me, of three folio closely written pages, dated Vernon, Shiawassee Co. State of Michigan, 7 Decr 1844. and enclosing two depositions.— The Letter consisted of a narrative of the writer’s removal from Canada to the United States during the last War with Great-Britain, and of claims of indemnity and of lands consequent thereon. Of a petition to congress, presented for him by Sherlock J. Andrews then a member from Ohio and of the report of the Committee against the claim for want of sufficient evidence— The Letter complains that Mr Andrews did not call up the petition at the subsequent Session—and requests me to do so now, and to present the two depositions enclosed in the Letter, one of which is from his Son. He founds his request upon my promise in July 1843 to the people of Albany; and requests that if I cannot attend to it, I would put the papers into the hands of Daniel R. Tilden, of Ravenna, from Portage County, Ohio— When and how this book with its enclosed papers came upon my table I know not but the Session had closed before I read the Letter—and the petition must lie over till the next Session of Congress— At Sunset I walked round the President’s house— Mr Campbell took tea and spent the evening here— Walter Hellen passed the day at Mr Moody’s— His mother lives there with her daughter and Son in Law— Mr Frye was here this morning, and returned me the Letter from Mr Whitaker.— Mr John Pope is to depart to-morrow on his return to his residence at Springfield— Kentucky.

Timothy 1.18 First clause of the verse— “The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day”— The words relate to Onesiphorus, an inhabitant of the city of Ephesus where Timothy was residing and ordained, when Paul wrote to him this Letter from Rome, the English Bible says when Paul was brought before Nero the second time— He was then in bonds, and complains that on his examination he had been deserted by all his companions— The tone of the Letter is gently plaintive and melancholy, but inflexibly firm. Onesiphorus had been exceedingly kind and bountiful to him at Ephesus— He therefore prays that he may obtain mercy from the Lord, in that day— Mercy! that is all for which Paul could pray in behalf of the worthiest of mankind The theory of Christianity is that the whole human race is a gang of malefactors living from age to age and from century to century in a state of total depravity—redeemed however from eternal punishment two thousand years ago, by the death of Jesus Christ, and for whose salvation the Mercy of God may be implored in that day—that is in the day of judgment. The tone of the preacher was mild but impressive—his discourse congenial to the temper of the Epistle— The style plain but not inelegant. Some remarks were made on the condition of Paul when he wrote the Letter—on the object of it which he thought was an urgent invitation to Timothy to come to him at Rome, and on the supplication for the divine mercy to Onesiphorus, which if necessary to so meritorious a person, must be so with far more self conviction to the miserable Sinners the professing Christians of the present day— The house was as thin as ever— Neither Mr Knox, the Pastor of the Church, nor Mr M’Lellan the Elder was present— The preacher prayed for the restoration of the Pastor’s health, and gave notice of a lecture to be delivered next Wednesday evening on the protestant reformation by the Revd. Ezra Stiles Ely— Walter Hellen dined at his mother’s. After dinner at St. John’s Church Mr Pyne, read the Evening service for the Sunday before Easter, and preached from John 18.38. “What is truth?” he barely glanced at the scene and occasion upon which Pilate put and left unanswered question, and generalized, or rather narrowed it down to an enquiry infinitely important to every Christian—what is religious truth— Mr Campbell, Dr Frye and Richard and Mary Cutts spent the Evening with us— Isaac C. Bates, Senator from the State of Massachusetts died at 20 minutes past 6. this evening. "

The President of the historical Society of Ohio, Columbus, John Howland Providence Rhode-Island, and the President of the Historical Society of Kentucky, Louisville—with each of these I forwarded one of the medals, and a card of Commodore Jesse D.

O’Clock this morning; and that he had been requested by the Committee of arrangements to ask my attendance there at that hour to accompany the corpse to the Capitol as one of the mourners— I went accordingly at the time, and met at the house of Mrs Whitwell, the Senators Evans, Mangum, Woodbury, Dayton, Sevier, and Cass, as the Committee of Arrangements, and the Senators Woodbridge, Huger, Crittenden, Benton, Sturgeon and Berrien, as Pallholders.— Mr Daniel Webster, as the surviving Senator from Massachusetts came in as chief mourner— I took a parting look at the lifeless face of the deceased— How changed from that which I had seen on the 26th. of last month, at dinner with him at Mrs Whitwell’s— At Noon, the procession moved on foot to the Capitol, consisting only of the Committee of Arrangements, the Pall-bearers, and the mourners—Mr Bates’s son, Mr Webster and myself— The corpse was taken into the central aisle of the Senate chamber— The Vice President George M. Dallas was in the chair.— The President of the United States and his six Cabinet Ministers and his private Secretary were present; a few of the Senators in their seats. Several of the foreign Ministers—General Scott and Officers were there, and the galleries were filled with citizens, males and female.— Mr Tuston late chaplain of the Senate a Presbyterian performed the religious solemnities, by reading the 90th.

Fendall, U.S. District Attorney dated at the Court house, and requesting my immediate attendance before the criminal Court held by judge Dunlop to give my testimony in the case of Thomas Sangster indicted for an assault upon me on the 18th of last January— I walked accordingly to the City Hall and on my way was accosted by a man from the State of Illinois, near Chicago, who said he merely wanted to shake hands and speak with me. I found the court engaged in a trial for a small theft of a breast pin from Mr Stiles the member of the house of Representative from Georgia who was present. Some question upon the admission of certain evidence arose in that case and it was intermitted to take up that of Sangster who was seated in the rear of the lawyer’s bar— I was sworn and requested to take the witness’s stand which I did— The indictment was not read— He had pleaded to it before— At Mr Fendall’s request I related the circumstances of Sangster’s assault upon me, as briefly as possible— A lawyer by the name of Ratcliff appeared in his behalf— He asked if I had observed any thing peculiar in his condition at the time.— I said I saw he was in a state of violent excitement which I attributed either to intoxication or insanity, but I did not know which— He asked if any thing had subsequently passed between Captain Sangster and me. I said I had received a few days a Letter from him containing a very handsome apology for the act; declaring his deep regret for it, and that it was a sudden and violent impulse which he could not controul and which he should never cease to lament— He did not say what had been the cause of his passion, but from the moment that I received his Letter, every trace of resentment was banished from my bosom and I should have been happy to have buried the whole transaction in oblivion— I had so declared when called before the grand-jury, and had expressed to them that so far as concerned my personal injury, they would in the considering the case set it entirely aside— Mr Ratcliff asked if I believed that Mr Sangster Letter to me was sincere— I said I had not a particle of doubt that it was so; and that from the moment of receiving it I had been banished every trace of resentment from my mind— Mr Ratcliff then read several Letters from General Scott, Adjutant General Jones, and several Officers, testifying the high character and distinguished military services of Mr Sangster— The judge sentenced him to 30 days imprisonment and 100. dollars fine.

When Mr Ratcliff had read the Letters yesterday testifying the honourable character and services of Captain Sangster, he addressed to the court an argument founded upon them, and upon my disclaimer of all desire for his punishment, on my account, for the mitigation of the sentence upon him— Mr Fendall, the District Attorney made no reply. Captain Sangster in his apology to me had not stated what his motive for his assault upon me, nor how it had originated. I mentioned this fact in my testimony, and it was specially noticed by the judge— Mr Ratliff said there was no motive— It was a sudden uncontroulable impulse of intoxication without motive.— But he knew better— The studious concealment of the motive is some indication of its nature— All the testimonials to Sangster’s character were given him as recommendations of him for appointments to petty offices which he solicited— He was moved to his assault upon me, as a Passport to a lucrative Office— That he was instigated to it by some Jackall of Jackson is highly probable— Or he had the instinct to see that nothing could so effectively recommend him to the patronage of John Tyler— The judge seemed somewhat embarrassed in delivering his judgment, acknowledging the weight of the certificates of character, and of my desire that he might be dealt with mercifully, but not overlooking the aggravated nature of the unprovoked offence, and the necessity of vindicating from outrage the immunity of the Representatives of the People in Congress— When he pronounced his sentence Mr Ratcliff earnestly intreated that its execution might be suspended until there should be time for an application to President Polk for a pardon, to which the judge assented. Within an hour afterwards Mr Ratcliff came to my house with the written application to the President, to which I readily subscribed my name declaring my concurrence in its prayer.— I finished yesterday my Letter toPaine, and am sick of it, but must nevertheless send it, and to escape from sinking into useless indolence resumed the review of the Report and Bill to indemnify the owners of the Spanish Schooner, Amistad, reported to H.R.U.S. on the 10th. of April 1844, once taken up in Committee of the whole house, and upon which I was preparing a speech, to make if it should be called up again— I went to the Senate chamber this morning; but they went immediately into Executive Business and adjourned without day— In the Supreme Court Library, Duff Green. Walk home; and twilight walk— Winter cold. "

Vernal Equinox  I went to the Capitol Yesterday Morning; to the Senate chamber just before they met, with a view to enquire of Reverdy Johnson the new Senator from Maryland for the manuscript copies of the proceedings of the District and Circuit Courts of the United States in Georgia, in the case of the Antelope, which were borrowed of me, for the use of the Counsel of Revd. Charles T. Torrey upon his late trial— Mr Johnson was one of his Counsel— But he had gone home the Night before last— I spoke to Mr George of Evans Senator from Maine, and remarked how his speech was mutilated in the Report of the Debate on the Bill to admit the States of Iowa and Florida into the Union, published in the National Intelligencer of the day— I urged him to publish his speech in a pamphlet; but he was disinclined.— The Senate immediately after Meeting went into executive business and I went into the library of the Supreme Court— I read there in 11. Peters 102, the case of the Mayor, Alderman and Commonalty of the City of New York Plfs vs George Miln— It reminded me of the duty of looking up all the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court on this and kindred questions, and specially to examine Gibbons vs. Ogden 9. Wheaton 203. and Brown vs State of Maryland 12. Wheaton 419— While I was in the Library, Duff Green and William Cost Johnson came in— Mr Charles W. Fenton brought me two numbers of a new monthly periodical for which I subscribed— This day there came a Mr Pennington inventor of the atmospheric railway about which some months since he delivered a Lecture which I attended— He has now invented a new missile called by him the furies, and concerning which he had a Letter from Coll. Totten.— He is now going to Europe to try the fortune of his inventions there.— Mr S. G Deeth had applied to me by a card and subscription paper for my subscription to the resumption of that work of which there are 8 volumes from 1825 to 1833, and which was then drop’d for want of patronage— He has now purchased the existing volumes of the series— He now proposes to undertake the continuation if he can obtain a subscription adequate to the expense— I subscribed, and told him I was the author of the Chapters from the 10th. to the 15th. inclusive of the 3d. Volume; and of the Chapter upon England of the 8th.— He said he would send me a set of the volumes to keep for him till next winter— Mr Campbell dined here, and Mr Frye spent the Evening with us. "

Mr Henry Doll, a methodist preacher from Shrewsbury in the State of Pennsylvania called on me, merely from curiosity as he said, and to have some conversation with me. But he has just publishe a book, a duo-decimo volume of 347 pages, entitled Jesus Witnesses or the “Great Salvation exemplified,[”] of which he let me have one copy for a dollar We had a long conversation upon spiritual subjects, in which I acknowledged my inability to believe in some of the portions of the creeds of all the Christian Churches.— I found him exceedingly tenacious of the atonement, and when I told him it was impossible for me to believe that my sins would be forgiven by my maker, by the crucifixion for blasphemy, of one man, nearly two thousand years ago, I saw that it pained him to the soul. He said that his undoubting belief of this was the greatest comfort and delight of his life— He asked if I was willing that he should pray with me— I said certainly—and he did kneel and pray very devoutly remembering me in his prayer with great kindness— He told me he had a son about 11 years old to whom he had given the name of Eutychus. That some months ago, this boy had of his own accord adopted the initial A. as an addition to his Christian name, and now always wrote his name Eutychus A. Doll.— That he himself had several times asked his son what he meant by this A. till at last he told him it meant Adams, and that he had adopted it to honour me. I am ashamed to repeat this tale; and still more ashamed to confess how delicious are tokens of reverent esteem from women and children.— I received this morning a Letter from Dr John Codman, who is going with his son Robert to travel in Europe, and requests me to obtain for them Passports from the Department of State— I went immediately and saw Mr Markoe who promised me to have them made out and sent to me in the course of the day, which he did— Major Turnbull was with him— We had a long conversation upon the various projects for the disposal of the Smithsonian fund— But he has involved himself considerably in debt in expenditures for the National Institute, the appropriation for which failed again at the recent session of Congress that he seems quite discouraged. We agreed however to have further consultation on the subjects— I walked for exercise to the College hill and the race grounds. Very few improvements in that direction— Mr Carleton of Louisiana was here this evening— He has written a metaphysical work on the mind; and wishes me to read his chapter on the Will, in which he dissents from the Doctrines of Locke— He will send it to me to-morrow.

There has been some ecclesiastical controversy whether this or the next Sunday is this year the proper day for the celebration of the festival of Easter, and there was in the National Intelligencer of yesterday a publication by Bishop Doane maintaining that this is the proper day, and citing Clavius for his authority: with an array of algebraic calculations, which he says he does not understand. I attended public worship this morning at the second Presbyterian Church, whose Pastor, Mr Knox, preached from Psalm 108.1. “O God, my heart is fixed” the meaning of which he understood to be, fixed in the service of God— The Discourse was an earnest exhortation of the preacher to his hearers to have their hearts fixed to sense God.— In what this service of God should consist, was not sufficiently defined. To do Justice, to love Mercy and to walk humbly before God are definite ideas, but I can conceive of no worship of God, which can carry with it the idea of serving him otherwise than by acts of beneficence to our fellow creatures The Service of God which consists merely of worship or adoration, is of very little account with me.— Mr Knox dwelt with great earnestness on our duty to serve God throughout our lives in sincerity and in truth— After ranging through the variety of motive to this service he considered the objections of worldlings to untake it— Then he adverted to the dangers of delaying our self devotion to the service of God, and concluded with pathetic appeals to the several classes of his auditory the old, the middle aged and the young. As I draw towards the close of my days the summons of a preacher of the gospel to the proper use of the remnant of my time, comes with deeper impression upon my mind than when I had longer prospects of life before me.— I spoke to Mr Knox after the service— He is barely recovered from severe illness which confined him several weeks to his house and observing the continued absence of Elder M’Lellan and his wife I enquired concerning him and Mr Knox told me he was so ill that it was not expected he would long survive— After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Pyne, another Clergyman, and Bishop Southgate a missionary bishop read the Evening service, for Easter day, and the Bishop preached from Colossians 3.16. [“]Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.”— Upon church music—a pleasing discourse Archibald Campbell and Richard D. Cutts spent the Evening here. Dr Sewall lies at the point of death. "

Easter Monday  Mr Niles heretofore Editor of Niles Register of which his father Hezekiah Niles was the first publisher and founder, came this morning and shewed me Letters from Henry Clay, and John M. Clayton encouraging him and urging him to repurchase the property of that work from Jeremiah Hughes its present Editor, to whom he some years since sold it— To reduce its subscription price from 5 to 3 dollars a year, and to resume the patronage of the American or protective system, the tariff and domestic industry— He said it had lost under its present editor three fourths of its subscribers, and did not now pay the expense of its publication— He wanted a Letter of recommendation from me similar to those from Mr Clay and Mr Clayton.— I declined and advised him to reflect well upon what he was about, before undertaking the labour and expense of a printing establishment to support the tariff or manufacturing interest, which is Peace continued was doomed to fall, and if War should come will support itself— I received a Letter from Daniel Wiley, Treasurer of the town of Medway, with a power of Attorney to receive any dividends due to that town on the book of the U.S. treasury. I went to the Treasury Department, received 3. dollars and 68 cents, by a draft on the Bank of the Metropolis which I deposited there and took for it a draft on the Merchants Bank Boston payable to me as Attorney for the town of Medway, which I endorsed to Daniel Wiley, treasurer of that town or his order, which I despatched to him by this days mail— I left with Mr Richard Smith Cashier of the Bank of the Metropolis, the Certificate of 7 Shares in the Stock of the Bank of the United States of Pennsylvania standing in my name as Administrator de bonis non, with the will annexed of Thomas Boylston, to be transferred to myself, Nathaniel Curtis and Charles Francis Adams Trustees of the Estate of Ward Nicholas Boston— Mr Smith said he would send me to-morrow Morning a power of Attorney to execute necessary for effecting the transfer— Mr Hague the Astrologer was here this afternoon, and noticed the appointment of certain Editors of Newspapers at the recommendation of James Buchanan Secretary of State. Hague said he had visite all the Grandees— That President and Mrs Polk would subscribe for his horoscope, and that Genl. Almonte did not know his own age He said he would call again to-morrow, and take the English Almanac which he had lent me— Mr Carleton spent a couple of hours with me this Evening in conversation upon his chapter on the will—maintaining that will is identical with judgment.

I have an anxious sensation fretting upon my spirits every morning to do something of the multitude of items of business gathering upon me from day to day and many of them procrastinated till they are forgotten— Mr Richard Smith Cashier of the Bank of the Metropolis, sent me this morning a power of Attorney to Herman Cope of Philadelphia, from me, to transfer 7. Shares of Stock of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania standing in my name as Administrator de bonis non, with the will annexed of Thomas Boylston to myself, Nathaniel Curtis and Charles F. Adams, Trustees of the Estate of Ward Nicholas Boylston— I executed and acknowledged it before Nicholas Callan a Notary Public, and left it with Mr Richard Smith to obtain the new Certificate— I finished an Address to my Constituents the inhabitants of the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts, with the Speech which I intended to have made on the Bill reported on the 10th. of April 1844. by the Committee of Foreign Affairs of the house, to indemnify the owners of the Spanish Schooner Amistad— A baser and more profligate misapplication of public money was never made than that proposed by this bill; and seven years in a penitentiary cell would be a strictly just retribution for the report— In examining the compositions of Charles J. Ingersoll, it is impossible to suppress indignation and next to impossible to speak of them in terms of moderation— There is in this report a long specious, snakish argument against the decisions of the United States Courts in the case of the Amistad captives— But it turns upon a gross and glaring forgery, a false date; alledging that the schooner Amistad was seized by Lieutt. Gedney on the 26th. of August 1840. when in truth the seizure was made on the 26th. of August 1839. I took my manuscript to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and left it with Mr Gales who promised me to publish it after two or three other speeches delivered at the late Session, which he has yet on hand— It will work out not quite six columns of the paper, and he promised to send me the proof slips for revisal. It is so slovenly and weak of composition, that I hesitated whether to publish or give it to the flames— This afternoon Mr William H. Grove, of Belmont County Ohio— A visit of curiosity, merely to see and converse with me— In the evening I wrote a short Letter to H. L. Ellsworth—Commissioner of Patents, to return the Ivory cane presented to me by Julius Pratt and Co of Meriden Connecticut, in deposit at the Patent Office "

Botts to Congress, of which he is confident.— Mr Lewis Johnson came in, but being immediately followed by Mr Lamb, of Missouri, said he would call again and withdrew— Mr Lamb told me that he had been introduced to me, by Mr Garrett Davis of Kentucky, and that he came to enquire to whom he must apply to obtain a called meeting of the National Institute— I mentioned to him, Mr Francis Markoe, the corresponding Secretary, and enquired for what purpose he wanted a special meeting of the Institute— He said that Mrof the State of Missouri had the finest collection of Mammoth bones in the world, and of the largest size— He was desirous to dispose of them, and there had been some overtures for the purchase of them by the Institute— He wished for the special meeting to ascertain what would be their final determination concerning it— I asked him what would be the price demanded for them— He said about 5000 dollars. I thought the funds of the Institute would not warrant them in making this purchase now.— I wrote to Messrs. Julius Pratt and Co. of Meriden Connecticut, and enclosed the Letter to Mr Henry L. Ellsworth, Commissioner of Patents, requesting him to forward it to them— I took the Cane with the Card and the Letters to the Patent Office and there finally deposited the Cane, and the card describing it— Mr Ellsworth was not at the Office, and I left them all with the Chief Clerk.

Volume of the American Archives, to a copy of which I am entitled, as an Ex-President of the United States— Mr Dickins the Secretary of the Senate, found the book, and promised to send it to me, apologising for not having sent it before— I went to the Librarian of the House of Representatives, and enquired for the set of Documents of the first Session of the 28th. Congress which should come to me from that office— After some enquiry, I found that they had not been sent because he had not yet received the Senate Documents of that Session—from the Book-binder.— But he promised to procure and send them to me— At the Post Office of the house, I took a bundle of covers of Letters, and at the document room the sheets numbered from 26 to 29. of the Journal of the House of the late Session, and N. 11. of the Senate Journal— As I was coming out from the Capitol I met the Daguerrotype printer Edwards who invited me into the Committee-room of which he has had the use and shewed me a number of the Portraits recently taken among which two of the new President Polk—one in a breast-pin reduced from the other, and bespoken for Mrs. Polk.

J. S. Skinner late assistant Postmaster general, contrasted his recent removal, with my treatment of him as Postmaster at Baltimore We came home soon after 11. "

The spring has returned with the warmth of summer, and I had no fire made in my writing chamber this day.— Morning visit from Mr Heap, heretofore Consul of the United States at Tunis; afterwards Dragoman of the Mission to Constantinople, and now a Solicitor for restoration to his Office at Tunis— Conversation with him. Anodyne— Mr Bodisco the Russian Minister said to me last evening, Sir Robert Peel adds 6000 Seamen to the British Navy for the service of the present year, and raises the estimates for the navy to the round sum of seven millions sterling 35 millions of dollars— That is for your special benefit— He takes your occupation of Texas very quietly—but he will send a large naval, force into the pacific, and then if you touch Monterey, War, universal War will blaze out— Whereupon I observe 1. Mr Bodisco, blows the coals. 2. He has no objection to the annexation of Texas to the United States— He said laughing that Russia, herself in the habit of taking ten times the amount of Texas, could not object to that measure, but the main point was to do it in a genteel way—and the inconceivable thing to him was that with the measures of Congress for the annexation of Texas, there was not a dollar of additional expense appropriated, in preparation for War. J. S. Skinner told me last Night that when I was President, and he was Postmaster at Baltimore he had written and published in the Newspaper sundry pieces against me, till he was told that I had heard of it, and after enquiring whether he faithfully performed the duties of his office, and being answered that he did, had said—then tell him he may write against me, as much, and as often as he pleases— Skinner added that from that day he never published or wrote a line against me— The rumours now are that Polk has consulted his cabinet on the principle of political proscription— That Buchanan, Walker and Mason were against it— Marcy, Bancroft and Cave Johnson for it—and that Polk himself decided for the turn out.— The morning of this day was absorbed in finishing a Letter to my Son, which I had begun last Evening. I took my twilight walk over the Tyber to the Potomac Bridge and thence returning over the central market bridge— Campbell spent the Evening here— Captain Tyler’s pocket veto upon the Harbour Bill, turned him out of Office at Pittsburgh, as a civil engineer, but the new Secretary of War Marcy has promised him a place in the Department here.— The practical distribution of my time falls yet far short of my resolutions in advance, and my arrears of correspondence increase instead of diminishing.— “Video meliora, probo que.” "

Saturday  Mr Lewis the contractor with this Government for the supply and support of the Light house establishment called on me this morning and invited me to inspect in the basement Story of the Patent Office, the new apparatus of Light house lamps invented in France by Fresnel and imported from France by Mr Lewis himself— I went accordingly, and saw three of the four Classes of refracting glasses substituted in the place of the old semispherical metallic reflectors— The Lamps are of brass the machinery for circulating the oil, and preserving the proper measure of the wicks curious and complicated— The polyzonal lenses round which a frame horizontally revolves with a similar denticulated glass of smoky crimson colour revolves forms a column of splendid light which must be seen to be understood. The four classes are graduations of the size of the lenses the largest of which are in 8 concentric circles— The smallest of the four is of the size introduced at the entrance of Boston Harbour— I agreed with Mr Lewis to go and see one lighted up next Monday evening at 7. O’Clock.— Fresnel first published a notice of this invention by a Memoir read before the Academy of Sciences at Paris Sur un nouveau systeme d’Eclairage des Phares, in 1822. It has now been introduced in all the maritime countries of Europe. Mr Campbell dined with us and has taken lodgings at Mrs Bihler’s three doors west of our house— He has succeeded in obtaining an office of confidential clerk under the Secretary of War, Marcy, but the City is in an uproar, at the system of proscription from Executive Offices upon which President Polk has commenced, and which threatens to be far more extensive than any that has ever before been carried through— I wrote three short Letters—one to the Secretary of the Treasury, to remind him of the act of Congress for the relief of John Adams, and John Adams junr. of Provincetown, Massachusetts, and to request him to cause the remittance to be made to them— One to them apprizing them of those facts—and one to Reverdy Johnson of Baltimore enquiring after the copies of the proceedings in the U.S District, and Circuit Courts in Georgia in the case of the Antelope— Mr Loring of Hingham came in this morning from Richmond, Virginia, where he has been in search of Coal— He is going to Cumberland on the same pursuit— He will go to church and dine with me to morrow. Dr Thomas was also here this evening. "

[“]Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” Mr Knox observed that the instructions of the Christian Gospel were given not in the form of one continuous dissertation connected together as one system, but were scattered abroad in detached sentences, and varieties of figurative language conveying the most important truths in lively and striking imagery— The text is a part of the address of the holy Spirit, in the Vision of the beloved Apostle, to the Church of Laodicea— He complains of their indifference— Neither hot nor cold— Of their spiritual pride, self-delusion and self-conceit He tells them that he rebukes and chastens those whom he loves; and exhorts them to zeal and repentance— Then he summons their attention to himself— Behold— I stand at the door and knock— A free, friendly and gracious invitation to partake of the blessings of the gospel, likened to the intimate endearing enjoyments of familiar hospitality, given and received. In the next verse he promises to the believer glory and power— He that overcometh shall sit with him on his throne; as he sits with the father on his throne; and he closes with a solemn call on him that hath an ear, to hear what the Spirit saith to the churches— Mr Knox exerted himself even beyond his usual animation in his appeal to Sinners to open the door to the Saviour as he knocks, and respond to his gracious invitation. The President and Mrs Polk were present, and in my pew were a stranger man, three Ladies and two small children— Mr Loring dined with us, and shortly before four O’Clock left us, to take passage at half past 5. in the railway Cars for Baltimore intending to stop this night at the Relay house, 9 miles on this side of that city, and to proceed to-morrow to Cumberland to visit the coal mine or mountain of that region— After dinner I attended at St. John’s Church where Mrread the evening service for the first Sunday after Easter— (The 2d. Lesson is the awful 15th. chapter of 1. Corinthians upon the Resurrection of the body,) and preached from Revelation 3.1. “And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. 2. Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain; that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.”  Richard and Mary Cutts were here this evening: and Dr Frye. "

Ellsworth; a document which he has rendered so interesting that at the recent Session of Congress, the house ordered 25000 extra copies of it to be printed for circulation by the members— He has for a succession of years been improving it from year to year, till it now forms a volume of 500 pages, and a calendar of mechanical and agricultural inventions and discoveries, more sought after than any other annual document published by Congress— Mr Ellsworth has turned the Patent Office from a mere gimcrack shop into a great and highly useful public establishment. Yet there has been from the day of Polk’s inauguration to the present a report in circulation that he has been or is from this day to be removed, and that Edmund Burke or Benjamin F. Bidlack is to be appointed in his place.— I read the report this morning— It consumed an hour of time, and diverted me from my prescribed and appropriate employment— Further it seduced me to turn over for another hour and more the subsequent pages, and the appendix to the report. As I proceeded I found continual instigation to further enquiry, and was finally obliged to break off so as not to lose the whole day— Another digression was occasioned by Mr I. W. P. Lewis, who sent me a bound book and two large pamphlets upon the subject of Light-houses— One of the pamphlets is in French, an Instruction sur l’organisation et la Surveillance du service des Phares et Fanaux des Cotes de France—published by the Ministére des Travaux Publics— Administration Générale des Ponts et Chaussées et des Mines— The English pamphlet is the Article Sea-Lights in the 7th. Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica by Alan Stevenson— These works give full and minute accounts of the modern improvements in the illumination of Light-houses and particularly of the dioptrical glass machinery of Augustin Fresnel substituted almost universally on the coast of France and very extensively in Great Britain for the previous, hemispherical metallic catoptrical reflectors used for lighthouses— Mr Lewis sent me word just at dark this Evening, that it was so damp with a prospect of rain that he should postpone lighting up his lenticular lantern to another evening of which he would give me notice. Mr Samuel Masters, a brother of Mrs Johnson of Utica was here this morning— He has resided five or six years in British Guiana Mr Campbell dined here, and was sworn into Office this eve. "

I took this morning a walk, and after delivering at the Bank of the Metropolis a Letter from Mr John Otis of Barnstable to Mr Lewis Johnson, and at the Department of State, a signalement, or description of their persons for the Passports of Revd. Dr John Codman and his Son Robert. I went to the Astronomical Observatory, within the last two years on the hill upon the borders of the Potomac and under the charge of Lieutt. Maury. I found him there but it was past Meridian, and with a beclouded sky. The site is beautiful, on the spot originally reserved by Genl Washington for a University.— The building is small and low, without any dwelling house or garden connected with it— The instruments which I saw were, on the first floor a mural circle fastened to a granite pier perhaps seven feet high a transit instrument in the form of a double cone suspended between two granite cubic columns. These two are in one room, and with sky-light doors on the roof over them and a sidereal clock in the room— In another there is an excellent solar clock, and about forty box chronometers kept for regulation to be supplied from time to time to the ships of the Navy going to sea— On the chamber floor, under a dome easily moveable round is a Frauenhofer Refractor of 14 feet focal distance with an object glass of 9 inches diameter— These instruments are susceptible of being used for valuable observations, but the building is not yet completed, and I apprehend not well built.— They concluded to make the magnetic observations underground, and have accordingly a subterraneous station; but it leaks either from springy ground or from rain— The stone floor is covered with water. They have been obliged to suspend the observations, and the instruments which are there, if suffered to remain there long, will perish by the dampness of the atmosphere— Lieutenant Maury was very obliging, and promised to call on me the first clear and dark evening, to go and look through the large refractor at the nebula in the sword of Orion— Mr R. I. Morsell came this afternoon and paid me 300 dollars the 6th. years instalment for the house, which I sold to him in 1839.— He seems not to be satisfied with the house nor with his bargain—and seems impatient to get his deed that he may sell the place and remove from it— Mr Campbell breakfasted with us, and Hague the Star-gazer was here in the Evening flustered.— He told me that Polk’s Cabinet would be smashed within four months.

Wednesday  Dr Todsen called this morning, but I had not been able to find the volume of my Silesian Letters which he wanted to borrow for his friend, who, he said he believed had found them in the first volume of the Port-Folio— Mr Lewis Johnson came and gave me to read the Letter from Mr John Otis of Barnstable which I had delivered to him two days since— Mr Johnson told me of several strange rumours which had got abroad and come to his ears, arising from the successful interference of the late Senator from Maryland Merrick, on the very last day of John Tyler’s administration, which obtained from him an order for the payment of his claim of 6812:68 as administrator of William Otis. He said Mr Merrick had been attacked in the Baltimore Patriot, for his final speech and vote on the Texas question, and had published in the Globe an answer in his own defence addressed to the Editor of the Patriot, who in his reply charges Mr Merrick with this arrangement for extracting money from the Treasury. And he added that he heard, as if by casualty severe and very erroneous remarks by Strangers relating to this affair, charging not only Mr Merrick, but Mr Tyler himself and the comptroller with sharing largely of the money. I said I was not surprized at the circulation of such rumours— They were natural exaggerations, of what I thought very exceptionable in the conduct of Mr. Merrick— Receiving 500 dollars for obtaining by personal influence from Mr Tyler the positive order on the last day of his administration for the payment of this claim, against the earnest opposition both of the auditor and comptroller of the Treasury. I believed the claim just, and rejoyced that it had been paid. But I could not approve Mr Merrick’s agency in obtaining it— I received from the Office of the National Intelligencer the proof slips of my Address and intended speech on the Bill to indemnify the owners of the Spanish Schooner Amistad and the report with which that bill was ushered into the house. I revised the copy, and took it to the Office for publication to-morrow. Mr Gales promise to print for me 100 copies in 8vo. form— He spoke of the multitudes of removals of persons from public offices, the besom sweeping at the present time without remorse, and being for the first time avowedly founded not only upon the principle of dismissing political enemies and providing for friends but for the further purpose of official rotation. Gales told me further that it was reported in the diplomatic circle that Buchanan the new Secretary of State had already exposed himself to ridicule by some official incongruity.— Campbell dined with us. While I was on my twilight walk I met Lieutenant Maury, who had called at my house to say that this Evening, being hazy was not suited to observation Mrs Talbot was here. "

Morning visit from Mr Macy of Cincinnati, with whom I travelled in a Canal boat in November 1843. from Cleveland in Ohio toand with him came Mr Savage, heretofore Chief Justice of the State of New-York, but which Office he resigned before he had reached the constitutional termination of threescore years— He told me that he had spent the winter here, in private life for the benefit of a milder winter climate than that of New-York— I answered a kind invitation yesterday received from my belle-fille, Mrs Charles F. Adams at Boston, and shall have finally to break away from hence without accomplishing almost any of those tasks which I had imposed upon the leisure of the present Spring and Summer.— I have effected only the Letter to R. F.

Ingersoll, with two slips from the Philadelphia Public Ledger of 25 and 26. October 1843. being a Law Academy Lecture on the Law of Foreign Missions delivered by him and which he request Gales to republish in the National Intelligencer— It is the offscouring of a common-place book of extracts from a multitude of writers from Moses to Sir James Mackintosh upon the Laws and usages of embassies.— This republication now must be to remind Mr Polk, of his peculiar qualifications for a foreign mission— The Lecture is an Olla Podrida, written in a lively Style, and as in all his compositions full of inaccuracies. I continued my walk to the Capitol, where I bespoke a second chest for transporting books and papers to Quincy; and received the additional sheets of the Journals of both Houses at the recent Session of Congress, and documents published since the close of the Session.

In looking over the documents printed during the progress of the recent Session of Congress the objects of enquiry multiply upon me so that I begin to fear for the soundness of my intellect, and get bewildered in the effort, to select from the mass a very few of the most important and confining myself to them to discard all the rest— The Patent Office Report made at the recent Session, for the year 1844. roused to such an extent my curiosity, that I have collected from my Chaos of old papers, the Reports of the two preceding years, and have devoted several hours every day of this week to trace the history of this office since its new organization by the act of 4. July 1836. and the subsequent fire of 15. December of that year.— By the 9th. section of the act of 3. March 1839. 1000 dollars were appropriated, for the collection of agricultural statistics; and for other agricultural purposes, for which the Commissioner was required to account in his next annual report.— This is the seed from which the annual Patent Office Report has gradually swollen into a volume.— On the 24th. of Decr 1833. a standing Committee on Patents was instituted in the House of Representatives of the United States; and such a Committee, of 5. members is appointed from Session to Session— I must pursue these enquiries further. I called this day on Mrs. Madison, and delivered to her according to the request of Commodore Jesse D. Elliott the silver medal in honour of James Fenimore Cooper, which he caused to be struck and of which he left with me, for the purpose— The other copies for the historical Societies, for Henry Clay, and for myself were all in bronze; this one only was in silver— Her Son John Payne Todd, and her niece Anna Payne were with her— I then paid a visit to Mr Pakenham the British Minister, and had a conversation of more than two hours on the general politics of the present times; and especially upon the Texas and Oregon questions— I spoke to him with unlicenced freedom, without drawing out anything but generalities from him— He lent me a small volume by Thomas Falconer—London 1844. on the discovery of the Mississippi, and on the South-western, Oregon, and North-western boundary of the United States— I took my twilight walk, and as it darkened Lieutenant Maury came with a Hack and took me to the Observatory where, I looked through the large Frauenhofer Refractor at the Nebula Di Orione at the Cluster of spangles in Auriga, at the blazing light of Sirius and at the double Star, Orange and blue, in Andromeda. Miss Maury a cousin of the Lieutenant and two other Ladies were with us— "

At the second Presbyterian Church this morning Mr Knox preached from Matthew 26.38.— [“]Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death”— The sufferings of the Saviour constitute an inexhaustible fund for pulpit eloquence. The mystery of those sufferings is incomprehensible.— The narrative by its simplicity and minuteness, beggars all human invention, and staggers all rational belief— He was executed for blasphemy, in strict conformity to the Mosaic Law delivered from Sinai.— The accusation attested by two false witnesses was that he had said he was able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days— He had said what was equivalent to it, but in a figurative sense, referring to his own death and resurrection.— When charged with the words before the High-Priest, he answered nothing, till by him adjured by the living God, to say whether he was the Christ, the Son of God he answered Thou hast said—and then added—nevertheless, I say unto you—hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of Heaven—whereupon the high-priest rent his clothes; declared Jesus guilty of blasphemy upon his own confession, and took a vote of the chief Priests, elders and council who sentenced him to death— All this he foreknew. Yet he had three times prostrated himself in prayer to God the father, that if possible this cup might pass from him— And yet when Peter smote off the ear of the high-priest’s servant, Jesus sharply rebuked him—said he could pray to his father who would give him more than twelve legions of angels—and Luke says that he touched the man’s ear and healed him. Mr Knox’s argument dwelt chiefly on the mental agony of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, of far more cruel torture than the suffering of the body by crucifixion; and this was urged as a consideration to fortify the doctrine of the atonement— In the afternoon, at St. John’s church, Mr Pyne read the evening service for the second Sunday after Easter, and Professor Goodman preached from Matthew 27.54. “Truly this was the Son of God.” It seemed little more than a continuation of Mr Knox’s morning discourse. The sufferings of the crucifixion and the incidents of humility, resignation, benevolence and self-sacrifice then exhibited by Jesus Christ were recapitulated in a very well written though not very well delivered Sermon. The Roman centurion exclaims truly this was the Son of God— The high-Priest adjures Jesus to say whether he is the Son of God. But are we not all Sons of God?— Mr and Mrs Polk were at the Presbyterian Church this morning; and as we came out this morning—after handing his Ladies into their Carriage he turned back and came up to me, and shook hands with me very courteously— I received these advances with a return of equal civility— Mrs Thornton and Mary Talbot here this eve.

O’Clock this morning, my neighbour and old acquaintance Richard Cutts, in the 75th. year of his age— He was a Classmate at Harvard University with my youngest brother Thomas, and graduated in 1790.— A native of the then District, now State of Maine— At an early age he was elected a member of the House of Representatives of the United States.— Here he became acquainted with and married Anna Payne, a Sister of Mrs Madison, since which time he has resided in this city.— By the friendship of Mr Madison he was appointed to several public offices, the last of which was that of second Comptroller of the Treasury, from which he was removed by President Jackson. Since 1829 he has lived here a private citizen, having successively lost his wife, and one daughter, and leaving one Son, James Madison, a Clerk in one of the public offices with a wife and children, one unmarried Son, Richard D, employed as an Engineer, and one unmarried daughter Mary Estelle Elizabeth, who lived with him and kept his house, and who for the last seven years has been almost an inmate of ours.— Mr Cutts, about 4 years my junior died of old age, and dropsy in the chest; he has been sick scarcely three weeks, and not supposed in danger till within one— I called in my morning walk at the Office of the National Intelligencer, and returned to Mr Seaton, the Letter and lucubrations of Charles J. Ingersoll, upon the privileges of Ambassadors lent me by Mr Gales.— I enquired for the 8vo. print of my address and speech on the Bill and report to indemnify the owners of the Schooner Amistad— Seaton promised they should send me the proof sheet this evening, which they did, and I revised it.— After much waste of time in deliberation I concluded to prepare a historical memoir on the Patent Office to be read at a meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the work of a month, if ever accomplished— I began upon it last Evening, and despair of being able to write more of it than the average of one page a day— I begin with the paragraph in the Constitution authorising Congress to promote the progress of Science and the useful arts.

I have imposed upon myself a task which enlarges as I proceed, so as already almost to frighten me from my purpose— I began this day by writing a page of my intended memoir, and it opened before me a field of enquiry at which I stood appalled— Without completing an abstract of the first Patent Law of 10. April 1790. I recurred to the Register of Congressional debates of the first Congress to ascertain if there was any discussion of principles in the concoction of the Law.— I found there some information, and more matter for further enquiry. In my morning walk I stop’d at the Patent Office, to converse with the Commissioner Henry L. Ellsworth; but he has been gone a week to Boston, and is not expected back before the end of this week— I obtained from the chief clerk a pamphlet copy of the present Patent Laws—one of Information to persons having business to transact at the Patent Office.— A supplementary Digest of Patents printed in 1842 of the Digest itself printed in 1839. there was no copy to spare— A complete copy of the Commissioners Report for the year 1843. which in the Executive Documents 28. Congress 1. Session. Vol. 4. is printed without the list of Patents. I borrowed also for hurried inspection Godson’s practical Treatise on the Law of Patents for inventions, and of Copy-right. 2d. Edition, London 1840.— A Supplement printed in 1832 to the first Edition of the same work first publishe in 1822.— And Perpigna, the French Law and practice of Patents for Inventions, Improvements and Importations— At the National Intelligencer Office, I stop’d and left the proof sheet of my Address and Speech revised and ordered 100 copies— At the Bank of Washington, I received 90 dollars due the 1st. of this month, interest on corporation 6. per cent Stock— I had purchased last week of Corcoran and Riggs, at 2 per cent premium 500 dollars more of that Stock, to reinvest 300 dollars paid me by Richard Morsell 6th. instalment for the house and lot which I had purchased of Daniel Baker— At the Capitol— Clerk’s Office; Document room, and Library I enquired for the Digest of Patents printed in 1839. but could not obtain a copy of it.— To enquire further.— Secretary of the Senate’s Office— Door closed— Library of the Supreme Court— 3. Wheaton 454. Evans vs Eaton, and Appendix N. 2. p. 13—and 7. 356— Same case—on the Patent Laws in 1822. and 1827— Walk home, Winter Gale or Semi-hurricane— Globe Office— Ordered and received the Congressional Globe and Appendix. 28. Congress 1. Session.— I received a Letter from Mr Charles W. Ridgely of Baltimore, with 100 copies of the Abstract of the proceedings of the National Lord’s day Convention at Baltimore 27. and 28. Novr 1844. and 75 copies of judge Willard Halls plea for the Sabbath, addressed to the Legal Profession in the United States, for circulation.— On returning home I found also a note from Richard D. Cutts to my wife, which I immediately answered. "

Fahrenheit 30.— Funeral of Richard Cutts  There was a new Moon last Sunday afternoon The weather was cool but moderate— The plum, cherry and Apple-trees in full blossom. The lombardy poplars dressing themselves in light green Monday, calm; barely cool, with the Indian Summer haze thickening to a dark cloud till 8 or 9 in the Evening. Then a sudden sweeping gale from the Northwest scattered all the vapours of the atmosphere, till the Sun rose bright yesterday morning with Fahrenheit at 26. The day and night were of January cold, March winds, and mountains of driving glassy dust. The wind subsided in the Night, and this morning my thermometer immediately after Sunrise was at 30.— The note from Richard D. Cutts to my wife received yesterday afternoon, was to enquire if I would serve as a Pall-bearer at the funeral of his father this day at 4. O’Clock P.M. to which I consented— I went accordingly at that time to Mr Cutts’s house, where the service was performed by Mr Pyne— Mr Cutts was not a member of any church, and seldom an attendant upon public worship.— His family are by habit episcopalians. Mr Pyne read the preliminary part of the service at the house and the remainder at the grave.— The Pall-bearers were Thomas Munro, General Jesup, Nathaniel Frye, W. W. Seaton, Richard Smith, Coll. Bomford, Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, and myself.— I rode with Genl. Jesup, Mr Frye, and Mr Seaton to the Cemetery of St John’s Church.— The chief Mourners who went to the grave-yard were James Madison Cutts, his wife and a Son and daughter, children, Richard D. and Mary E. E. Cutts, son and daughter of the deceased, a small girl, daughter of Thomas deceased, the third son, Mrs Madison, Anna Payne, and John Fairfield, the Senator from Maine, who married a niece of Mr Cutts— He was buried in a small enclosure where there were already two small monuments covered with marble slabs, side by side, and superscribed with the names of Anna Payne Cutts his wife born in 1779. and who died 4. August 1832 and of Dolly Payne Madison Cutts a second daughter who died in 1838.— I returned with my three fellow Pall-bearers to the house of Mr Cutts and thence walked home, by 6. O’Clock— There were three several alarms of fire this evening, and for the last fortnight there has been scarcely a day without one— I made small progress this day in the historical memoir upon the Patent Office, the plan of which is yet to be shaped so as to form a discourse so as to take from an hour and a half to two hours in reading— It must not be more and might perhaps be compressed within the space of one hour— The most formidable difficulty is to give it an interest by a dash of philosophical speculation. I am endeavouring to trace the origin of Patent and Copy-right Laws to the Laws of Nature, and the primitive rights of man.   "

My enquiries concerning the Patent Laws, are leading me into a boundless Ocean, upon which I am already afloat, without rudder or compass.— In analising the first Patent Law of Congress, of 10. April 1790, an example of the exercise of the power granted by the Constitution, and considering whence it originated I was brought immediately to a search into the details of the English Law. I came at once to the Statute of James I. Chapter 3. 1624. which unfolds the whole theory of natural right— That Statute, published in Godson’s Treatise, declares all monopolies and grants of special privileges by the crown contrary to Law null and void— By a Section of the Act, Patents for new inventions for 14 years, and under, are specially excepted, provided they do not increase the prices of good, are not contrary to Law or inconvenient— The authority of the crown to issue such Patents is recognized as a part of the common Law— I hunted an hour or two in the Madison papers to see if there was any trace of a debate in the Convention which formed the Constitution, upon the introduction of the clause giving the power to Congress to issue Patents— In England it is a flower of the Royal Prerogative— The inference from the clause in the federal Constitution is that it was held to have reverted by the Revolution to the whole People of the Union and was proper to be conferred upon Congress— It is a nominal power to promote the progress of Science and useful arts, by a specific power to secure to authors and inventors, for a limited time, the exclusive right to their writings and inventions.— I found nothing about it in the Madison papers. I had received last evening a note from Mr I. W. P. Lewis advising me that he would this evening at half past 7. light up his french light-house lamps, on the ground floor of the Patent Office building and inviting me to come and see it— I went accordingly and was astonished at the effect of the lighting of the Fresnel lamps There were lighted at the same time, two of the lamps late in use at the Boston light-house, and similar to those now in use there— The difference is scarcely conceivable between the illumination of the old lamps, and the first class of the new— But it was not equal to the difference between the illumination of the first and fourth class— This last produced a blaze as insupportable to look at as the Sun at noon day with a clear sky.— Mr and Mrs Larned and Mrs Newman were there and a few others afterwards, men and women— The largest lamp consumes 518. gallons of oil in a year.

Doctor Thomas Sewall died yesterday morning at 1 O’Clock, of Pneumonia, the same disease for which he had attended Mr Bates— The last time that I saw him was as he passed before me to go out of the Senate chamber, called out as one of the physicians of the deceased, following the hearse of Mr Bates to the Railway depot. He then probably took the disease for he sickened the next morning, an died on the 22d. day— He was born at Augusta Maine 16. April 1786. and about the year 1820 came and settled as a physician in this city, when I became acquainted with him— In 1828. he joined as a communicant the methodist episcopal church, in which he was for several years a class leader— In 1821 he was appointed professor of anatomy in the Columbian College, in which stationed he continued till his death— He has been in full practice as a physician and much distinguished as a medical writer, especially on phrenology and Temperance— I attended his funeral, this afternoon which was from the methodist episcopal church at the corner of F and fifth Street. Walter Hellen went with me but the church was so crowded that I had some difficulty to get in, and make my way up to the side of the pulpit— Religious services were performed, and a very plain and modest discourse of an hour upon his life and character was delivered by the minister of the church— The procession of carriages was numerous, and I joined in it, till it passed by my house, when I withdrew from it and remained at home. Mr George Bancroft, now Secretary of the Navy called on me this morning, and again in the evening, and I had two long conversations with him on subjects connected with the Navy Department, the Observatory, the magnetic apparatus and observations, the Smithsonian bequest; and the National Institute; and finally upon Mr Lewis’s catoptrical Light-House Lamps and the Patent Office— He asked for advice with regard to the Observatory and the magnetic observations, which are suspended. My advice was, 1. To build a dwelling house adjoining the Observatory 2. To order immediately the resumption of the magnetic observations.— Much—too much loose and desultory conversation besides to be very much restricted hereafter— Mr Bancroft professes great zeal to make something of his Department— I heartily wish he may. He intends to be a hard working man— Practice should follow and realize theory— Drop the Anchor, Hope! "

The morning being clear and cool I walked to the observatory to witness the fall of the ball from the top of the flagstaff over the dome of the building, at noon— As I approached it I saw the ball hoisted by a line to the top of the staff, and entered the house just in time to hear the signal given to drop the ball— This is not done however as I supposed it was by an actual observation of the Sun passing over the meridian, but merely by the indication of a good astronomical Clock— I went with Lieutenant Maury over the whole of the first floor of the building, and inspected again the great mural circle constructed by Troughton and Semmes, and the transit instrument with its appendages made by Ertel and son at Munich— In another room there is another smaller and more easily manageable transit instrument which I had not seen at my former visit— The complications of mechanical inventions in the construction of these instruments form a wonderful exhibition of the faculties of the human mind, and a humiliating demonstration of the weakness of mine, in my inability even to understand the causes and effects of this minute machinery. Mr Maury invited me to come again this evening which I promised to do, if the sky should continue clear; but immediately after Sunset it clouded up, and I did not go— I mentioned to Mr Maury my opinion of the absolute necessity of a dwelling house adjoining the Observatory of which he has a feeling conviction He is also now sensible that the wetness of the cellar which has caused the suspension of the meteorological observations, comes not from rain but from the moisture of the ground.— He promised me a list of the persons employed on this service, and the special duties assigned to each of them— As I was walking home, a stranger very civilly accosted me in the street, and introduced himself to me, as Mr Bagby, Senator from Alabama. On reaching home I found at my door Mr Gurley former Secretary of the Colonization Society, but now I know not what; with whom I had a long conversation upon Slavery, Slave-trade, Texas and Mexico, till Mr Pakenham the British Minister came in; whereupon Mr Gurley withdrew. Long conversation with him also chiefly about Oregon. He says he has not yet heard from the new Secretary of State Buchanan on the subject Mrs Mason, wife of the present Attorney General, now our neighbour next door to Mrs Thornton, visited my wife by card.— Mr Dewey from New-York and Mr J. S Wells from New-Hampshire were afternoon visitors; and Dr Thomas came and visited my Granddaughter Mary-Louisa who is unwell with a sick head ache, and sore throat.— My labours were much interrupted.

                "text": "13. IV:45. Sunday.  At the second Presbyterian Church this morning, Mr Knox preached from Psalm 90.2 “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth, and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” Without indulging an irreverent Spirit, or an infidel propensity, I often fall into philosophical enquiries, setting aside all belief of miraculous events, and of divine inspiration, what it is that has made the tribe of Judah the Legislators of all civilized men, and the Bible, of all books in the world the most beloved and respected— Why is it that of all nations of antiquity the books of the Hebrews constitute the holy Scriptures, and that the law delivered from Sinai is at this day the code of the Christian world? Is it not that with them originated the idea of Elohim—of Jehovah— Of one omnipotent creator of the world— The omnipotence and eternity of God, is the germinating idea of man’s immortality and of his responsibility to his creator emanates— There is no more copious fountain of eloquence in the pulpit, and Mr Knox handled it much more to my satisfaction than he, or any other man can do, with the doctrine of the atonement—or of the trinity, or of the god-head of the Son of man— If God has created man with a sense of right and wrong, the measure of his rights and his duties must be the will of his maker, and that will must be Justice tempered with mercy.— After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Pyne read the Evening service for the third Sunday after Easter, and preached from Psalm 34.8 [“]O taste and see, that the Lord is good.”— There seems to be and incongruity of figure in this sentence, inasmuch as taste is not the sense which administers to the eye—but the remainder of the verse is the lesson that completes the sense, and the summary of the whole Psalm— Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.— The goodness of God is a theme most acceptably following immediately after that of his eternity and his omnipotence— Mr Pyne repeated a notice which he had given this morning that he should through the Summer read the evening prayer every week-day at half past 5 in the afternoon.— Mr Stockton the purser in the Navy was here after church, and in the Evening Mr Campbell, who has returned from Pittsburgh with his wife and child. He was fortunate in leaving that City only 3 hours before the fire broke out. "

My task of writing a historical memoir on the patent Office grows so irksome as I proceed, that I begin to feel discouraged, and apprehensive that I shall slacken in diligence and give it up in despair. I began with it this morning immediately after the exercise of the rising hour but my work advanced so sluggishly that it was near 4. P.M. before I completed the daily page— I had not been out of the house; and was left to my twilight walk and the evening Lamp, for the record and remaining occupation of the day. I passed this day from the first to the second act of Congress constituting the Patent Law, for the time— This system continued in force till the act of 4 July 1836. The improvements of the second act upon the first were to be correctly ascertained and noted. The additional provisions indicated and both continually compared with the cotemporaneous condition of the English Law— Dry and heavy, dull and tiresome—it drags its slow length along.— By way of relaxation and amusement from hour to hour I roused myself and folded up and despatched in various directions copies of the abstract of proceedings of the Baltimore Lord’s day convention of last November, of judge Willard Halls Plea for the Sabbath, of my address and speech on the report and Bill to indemnify the owners of the Amistad, and of my Letter of 4 July 1843. to the Bangor Committee—which four documents I enclose under one cover and send off without much discrimination to whom— I had morning visits from Revd. R R. Gurley, with a judge Upham from New Hampshire, son of a former member of Congress now deceased, from Luther C. Peck, an excellent member from the State of New York, of the 24th. and 25th Congresses, who married here, and is now here with his wife on a visit to her relations, and from Antoine and Louis Gibert, who came to take leave, departing for New-York. I gave to Antoine a Letter of introduction to Mr Charles A. Davis Louis has fine talents as a Painter, and painted a portrait of me last year which passes for a strong likeness and a very god picture. But his chief relations with us have been as teacher of music vocal and instrumental to my granddaughter Mary Louisa for nearly two years.— In my twilight walk I stop’d and took tea at Mr Frye’s. Mrs Frye and Mrs Smith had just returned from Mr Pyne’s Vespers The Clerks at all the public Offices are all horror-struck at an order just issued from President Polk that they are to keep their offices open, from 8 in the morning till 6 P.M in Summer and till 4. P.M in Winter.— Dr Frye walked home with me— "

Wise, U.S. Minister to Brazil relating to the Slave trade carried on there, and to the participation in it of Citizens of the United States, and of British Subjects. This Message was referred in the House to the Committee of Foreign Affairs—which made no report upon it; for which they had indeed no time, the message and documents not being printed till after the close of the Session— The Message and Documents form a pamphlet of 88 pages, of which I read 30— Two hours gone and call to Breakfast.— Shortly before noon I called at the Navy Department to see Mr Bancroft, but he was gone to a Cabinet Meeting at the President’s. I left with his chief Clerk Mr Lee a copy of my Report of March1840. on the Smithsonian bequest to be given to him with my particular request that he would read it— I rode to the Capitol— Returned to the Library some books that I had taken out— They told me, that of 900 copies of the Digest of Patents printed in 1839. deposited there had been distributed among the States by joint Resolution of Septr 1841. and 200 remain in the Library to await the further order of Congress which has not yet been given. I asked if I could not borrow one of the copies— No— Not without an order from Congress— I enquired at the Clerk’s office of B. B. French late Clerk of the House. He did not know that such a book existed. There was not a copy of it in his office— But I got a copy of the Acts of Congress passed at the late Session, and the Reports of the Commissioner of Patents for 1843 and 44. with the lists of Patents.— At the Patent Office I found that the Commissioner was returned from Boston, but not at the Office. I made further enquiry for the Digest of Patents, and a copy of it was afterwards sent to me from the Office.— Mr I. W. P. Lewis walked with me from the patent office to my house and proceeded to the Treasury Department to see the Secretary Robert J. Walker.— Mr Lewis said the merchants of Boston had addressed a memorial to the Secretary of the Treasury requesting him to cause a lenticular glass lamp of the french Fresnel forth class to be erected at the long island lighthouse in Boston harbour— Towards evening we had visits from Mr and Mrs Campbell with her infant daughter from Pittsburgh— And later, from Mr Bancroft accompanied by Mr T. C. Grattan the British Consul at Boston. Long conversation with them. Mr Bancroft gave now another reason for the suspension of the meteorological observations at the depot of maps and charts—namely that the appropriation was exhausted— Mr Bancroft promised me that he would read my report on the Smithsonian bequest.

Lieutenants Maury and Blair left cards here— Blair is said to be a son of the editor of the Globe Mr Lewis came this morning, and shewed me a manuscript draught of the whole coast of the United States, with the location of every lighthouse marked by a red dot upon it— He also gave me a statement as I had requested of the cost of each of the four classes of the lenticular apparatus for lighthouses; and of the comparative expense of maintaining the Fresnel system of lighting with that now existing. He estimates a great increase of illumination, and some saving of expense, by the adoption of the French system— I read this morning 30 pages more of the Message with Wise’s correspondence relating to the Slave trade in Brazil— Two hours.— Mrs Wilkes sent the 5th. 4to Volume of the Narrative of the exploring expedition requesting the return of the other four, and the volume of Charts which she had sent before— They were returned; but I had scarcely had time to look into one of them— It was nearly 3. O’Clock before I finished my record of yesterday— I took to the National Intelligencer Office, the Title page and Index of the last volume of Niles’s Register; but the binder had them already.— Mr Gales spoke to me of this Slave trade Message with Wise’s correspondence, and he read to me a letter from Mr Slacum heretofore Consul at Rio de Janeiro to him, requesting that he would ask me to move in the house of Representatives calling for his, Slacum’s correspondence with the Department of State relating to the Slave trade— Slacum had made the same request in a Letter to Mr Bradley which he gave me— I offered the Resolution which was adopted by the house on the 25th. of February; but the call was not answered when the Session of Congress closed— Mr Peck of the State of New York called on me again with two of his neighbours Mr M’Ilwain and Mr Weed. I had received last Evening a note from Mr Frye containing enquiries upon what terms I would sell the Columbian Mills— As such enquiries are only made to run down the value of the property, I rode to Mr Frye’s and gave him verbally my answer for all such questions— The weather was beyond high Summer heat. I walked home and all but blind wrote a page of the Memoir on the Patent Office, and a page of an obituary notice for the Newspaper of the late Richard Cutts. His Son Richard has by a note requested of me this good office, which I have not the heart to deny, but which I find it next to impossible to perform— Much of my weary hours was absorbed also in folding up and despatching public documents.

I had read part of the book lent me by Mr Pakenham, on the discovery of the Mississippi, and on the Southwestern Oregon, and the Northwestern boundary of the United States; by Thomas Falconer, of the honourable Society of Lincolns Inn— London Samuel Clarke 18. Pall mall East— I resumed the reading of this book this morning, which is a sort of argumentative Treatise, upon the Texas and Oregon questions of such fearful magnitude in the present condition of our Country. There is much information with some important errors in the Dissertation of Mr Falconer; but the chief interest of his book, is in the translation of Original Memoirs of La Salle and Tonti, and other documents recently published which I had never before seen. I called this morning first at the Department of State, and had a long conversation with the Secretary Buchanan.— I enquired what had been done with the call of 25 Feby for the correspondence of the former Consul at Rio de Janeiro, Slacum—he made enquiry of Mr Derrick who found the Resolution, and said it had been received too late to be answered before the close of the session— I enquired if any further despatches had been received from Mr Wise since his letter to Mr Calhoun of 14. December 1844 communicated with the message of 20. Feby last— He said, speaking confidentially that a very long despatch had been received, and a voluminous correspondence which he had not yet had time to read through—but there had been great excitement, and a quarrel of which he gave me a brief summary. A confused account of it has been published in the Newspapers, in a private letter from Rio de Janeiro dated 9. Feby. last— I said I highly approved Mr Wise’s exposure of the scandalous slave trade carried on by Americans and English from Brazil. But I was apprehensive he had carried out the spurious doctrine that the flag carries territorial jurisdiction with it all round the world to an untenable extent—and I hoped the President would not assume it, for it could not be maintained He said he thought so too— He said he would examine the whole correspondence, and see me again. In the chief Clerk (Derrick)’s chamber I met Mr Ellsworth the Commissioner of Patents, and shortly afterwards called on him at his office. I put many questions to him concerning the origin and early history of the Patent Office; but the fire of 1836 has consumed almost all the primitive records— The Digest of 1839. divides all the patents issued into 22 Classes of subjects with an alphabetical list of patentees— I asked if there was a chronological list marking the succession of tim in the dates of the issues. There is not— Nor any list of the eminently useful important and successful patents. Mr Ellsworth spoke to me of the obstinate resistance he had to encounter from John C. Calhoun to the improvements in his reports, since the new organization of the Office in 1836. and the bitter complaints of Edward J. Black of Georgia that the Patent reports are regarded as Tariff Documents, and actually defeated his election.— The Revd. Mr Collins came with a subscription paper for a history of the United States in 4 volumes, byFrost— I had a long and unprofitable conversation with him—too much of myself. "

John Miller a son of Dr Miller the head of the theological seminary at Princeton New Jersey, is settled as a Presbyterian Minister at Fredericton, Maryland— Last Night and the night before there were fires of which I knew nothing till the morning.

Evans in behalf of the Committee of arrangements, for the attendance of myself and my family, at the dedication at 11. O’Clock this morning of the Methodist episcopal church on Massachusetts Avenue near 9th. Street— I went accordingly, and found the place not without difficulty; for long as I have lived at Washington I did not even know in what direction the Massachusetts avenue was to be found— I was wandering round in the neighbourhood of 9th. Street when a stranger who was walking with a Lady, met me, and seeing I was upon the search asked me if I was looking for the Methodist Church— I said I was, and he told me it was two squares above. The Massachusetts avenue runs parallel, with the Pennsylvania avenue, due north, and about half a mile distant from it— But it is not laid out as a street— My strolling had belated me— The Church was excessively crowded and there were numbers of people standing in the street without the doors— An attendant at the Church saw me as I approached, beckoned to me to follow him, and made way for me through the throng up to the Chancel fronting the pulpit where they gave me an armed chair— The Secretaries of State and War, Buchanan and Marcy, the Mayor W W. Seaton, J. C. Rives one of the Editors of the Globe and the Revd. R. R. Gurley were there.— President Polk, and his wife with a younger handsome woman soon after came in. The President had a chair given him in the chancel, and the ladies two in the side aisle— Mr John Y. Mason the attorney General soon after came in with two little daughters.— I found the Revd William Ryland, a chaplain at the Navy-Yard, in the pulpit reading the first chapter of Isaiah—after which he read the latter part of the 14th. chapter of Matthew— Then the choir sung a methodist hymn, and Mr Ryland preached from Isaiah 11.9. the latter clause of the verse—“the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.”— Then notice was given that the Revd. Mr Slicer would preach this afternoon at 1/2 past 3. and this evening at 1/2 past 7. and Mr Slicer himself made a cormorant exhortation for a bountiful contribution to pay the debt for building the church; and he gave a pleasant account how Methodist churches are built and maintained, all by voluntary contribution— Then the Hallelujah chorus was sung by the choir and the congregation was dismissed.— I walked home with Mr Mason and his daughters.— After dinner at the Presbyterian church, Mr Knox preached from 2. Peter 1.16. [“]For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty.” Prophesy as among the Evidences of Christianity.— Evening visit from Richard D.

                "text": "21. IV:45. Monday  Some six or seven days since a slight soreness of my left thumb at the edge of the nail announced an inflammation, not otherwise perceptible— Hoping that it would pass away I said nothing of it and did nothing for it until yesterday afternoon when the thumb was swollen, the inflammation manifest, and the pain so pungent that I could no longer keep my counsel, and resorted to Mrs Goods for a bread and milk poultice. With this I went to bed last Night, but suffered acute pain without possibility of sleeping till about 1. A.M. when I threw off the poultice, and obtained about two hours of sleep— I sent this morning for Dr Thomas who ordered a flax-seed poultice—with laudanum which asswaged the pain, and quickened the suppuration— He came again towards evening, ordered a fresh poultice and another at bed-time, with a potion of hoptea mixed with a tea spoonful of paregoric— My occupations are much disturbed by this incident, but will, I hope not be entirely broken up.— Mr Bond was here, and I had much conversation with him respecting the Astronomical and Magnetic observatories.— He thinks the dwelling house, and the building for the magnetic observations indispensable here, and that they may be detached from the Observatory, but connected with it by covered ways— The magnetic observations have been superseded at Cambridge as well as here, and I see that Bancroft will talk more than he will act.— I finished the reading of Mr Thomas Falconer’s book on the discovery of the Mississippi and on the Oregon, which gives me an entire new view of the Louisiana question.— The Second Memoir of La Salle printed first in this proves that his expedition from La Rochelle in 1684 was warlike against the Mexican mines.— But I must suspend my further enquiries on this subject—and return the two volumes of Hennepin, Tonti; and Joutel to the Library of Congress. I had the curiosity on my Meridian walk to ascertain the walking distance by 9th. street from the Pennsylvania to the Massachusetts Avenue—found it 13. minutes—two thirds of a mile.— Mrs Thornton sent me several papers of the late Doctor relating to the Patent-Office useful to my enquiries; but which suggest others— I find myself continually arrested by chronological uncertainties which I cannot stop to ascertain— In all undertakings to write Lectures, Addresses, Orations or Memoirs, if I suffer myself to be interrupted, I scarcely ever am able to resume the subject. My abortions of this kind are almost numberless— As Napoleon said to Count Romanzoff, il faut que j’aille— I must go ahead— Mr I. W. P. Lewis has sent me several papers relating to the struggle of S. Pleasonton the 5th. Auditor, against the introduction of his Lenticular lights— I have traced through the two Miscellaneous Volumes of Gales and Seaton’s State Papers a chronological list of all the Patents issued under the Government of the United States.

The flax-seed poultice tinctured with laudanum and the hoptea with paregoric gave me a sound sleep last Night, so that I heard nothing of the ringing of bells a full hour for a fire, between 1 and 3 of the morning. There have been similar alarms the two preceding nights, and scarcely a day without some alarm has passed within the last month— This morning I was compelled to omit my daily frictions; and took a Seidlitz powder. Mary-Louisa had not left her chamber till this morning when by Dr Thomas’s direction she took a morning ride. I went with her and Walter Hellen who is also much indisposed with symptoms of fever— I had received a Letter from Thomas G. Addison Louisville Kentucky, enquiring after a Memorial to the House of Representatives, sent me last January by Edmund F. Lee, of Jeffersonville Indiana— I found by my minutes that I presented it last 15. January and that it was entered on the journal of the house of 16. Jany as referred to the Committee of roads and Canals—on attempting last Evening to answer Addison’s Letter, I could not find on the Journal whether the Committee had reported— So I went and enquired at the Clerk’s Office, and found they had not— I borrowed from the Supreme Court’s Law Library the 3d. and 7th volumes of Wheaton’s Reports, to examine the two trials of the case of Oliver Evans against Eaton, and the note on the patent Laws in the Appendix to Vol. 3. p. 13.— At the patent office I stop’d and left the Carriage to return home— I enquired of Mr Ellsworth if there was in the office any record to shew who the Clerks were charged with the duty of making out the Patents before Dr Thornton; and who after his death were the superintendants of the Patent-Office; and when he Ellsworth was appointed to that Office— He said that if there had ever been any records of the early administration of the Office they had been burnt in the fire of December 1836. He thought it probable there might be such records at the Department of State— He said that he was appointed in 1835 Superintendant of the Patent-Office; and obtained in 1836 the reorganization of the whole establishment by the act of 4. July 1836.— That Forsyth and Calhoun and the whole Southern interest were utterly opposed to his plan and Mr Van Buren was much influenced by them.— That Forsyth had a plan of his own, but they were both submitted to the Committee of the Senate, who by the influence of Mr Ruggles, then a Senator from Maine, pronounced in favour of his plan.— That he drew the Bill, which was submitted to the examination of judge Story, who suggested some slight modifications, and it was carried through the Senate by the influence of Mr Ruggles "

I received this morning a Letter from Mr Jesse Perkins of North Bridgwater expressing an apprehension that efforts were in progress to effect the removal of Edward Southworth junr. Postmaster of the principal Post-Office in that town—strongly remonstrating against it, and requesting me to exercise my influence, if I have any to prevent it. Mary-Louisa who is yet indisposed and threatened with fever, rode out with her mother, and left me at the General Post-Office— I read to Mr Johnson the material parts of Mr Perkins’s Letter. He sent for the papers relating to the office at North Bridgwater, and one of the Clerks brought them to him. There were two representations from Mr Southworth against his removal, and four or five remonstrances signed by as many hundred names, also against it—but no application for the removal— Mr Johnson made a minute on the papers that if an application for the removal, notice of it should be given to me.— I went next to the Office of the National Intelligencer for the paper of last Monday, which we had not received, and of yesterday which contained my obituary notice of Richard Cutts— Mr Seaton gave me to read two Articles, one from Bennett’s Herald, and the other from the New-York Commercial Advertiser, upon the flare up, between H. A. Wise, and the Brazilian Government about the Slave-trade. Wise has undertaken to carry out the ridiculous pretensions of territorial Jurisdiction carried round the world by a flag staff, palmed upon a Slave ridden Senate by John C. Calhoun, and upon this Nation by the tame and Slave-ridden Senate— From Mr Seaton I went to the Department of State and enquired of Mr Derrick now acting as chief Clerk about the administration of the Patent Law under the first act of Congress, and until the appointment of Dr Thornton—also the dates of the appointment of the successors of Dr Thornton as Superintendants of the Patent Office until 1835. when Henry L. Ellsworth was appointed. Derrick knew nothing about it, and that there was nothing of the Documents or information that I wanted on the files or among the vouchers of the Department he was perfectly sure— But he would enquire and ascertain and let me know— I was thus cast back on my own resources, and in looking for the annual reports of the List of Patents found in the Executive Documents of 21. Congress 2. Session. N 58.—a Report of Martin Van Buren Secretary of State, with a Digest of all the Patents issued until that time, dated Jany 1. 1831. prepared by Thomas P. Jones, then a clerk in the Department of State, but shortly before superintendent of the Patent Office—which was then held by John B. Craig.— This Document was reported under a Resolution of the House of Representatives of 2. April 1830. offered by John W. Taylor of New-York— It includes a digest of the decisions of the U.S. Courts on the Patent Laws. "

Thursday  Dr Thomas was again here this morning, and on inspection of my thumb ordered the continuance of his medical treatment for it, a flaxseed poultice at Night, and a plaister of basilicum salve in the morning. He dispenses now with the hop tea and paregoric, and allows a tumbler of cream of tartar lemonade once a day. Mrs Goods has been my nurse, but is now herself taken away and has left the burden of it to my wife— How deeply this intrenches upon my purposes of occupation I dare not acknowledge to myself but bear up against it as I can— I called this morning at Mr Pakenham’s to return the book which he had lent me, by Thomas Falconer— There was a hack waiting at the door, and the servant after going upstairs to enquire, returned and said Mr Pakenham was not at home— I left the book requesting the servant to say that I proposed to go northward next week, and wishing to see Mr Pakenham would call again before my departure— The Caledonia Steamer arrived at Boston last Monday.— She brings the report of a debate in Parliament, both houses, on the 4th. instt—upon the insolence of President Polk’s inaugural— They bluster much more modestly in return. But it is the first spark of Spirit that they have exhibited to meet a continual series of gross insults from the conclusion of the Ashburton Treaty to this day. I called at the Navy Department to converse with Mr Bancroft upon the Astronomical and magnetical observatories— I proposed to him a plan for transferring the Observatory already built to the Smithsonian Institute, as in the draughts of the bills that I have reported to the House at three successive Congresses—and to put the keeping of maps and charts, and chronometers and quadrants upon another establishment— He was all acquiescence and accommodation to my wishes; but he sent for Commodore Crane, now one of the Commissioners of the Navy Board, who thought the custody and regulation of the Chronometers, Quadrants and other instruments for navigation, should be in the same building with the observatory and always under the charge of the Navy Department— So that a compromise appears to be impracticable— I came home despairing of my own project for the disposal of the Smithsonian fund; and renewed my historical enquiries concerning the Patent Office. Seyberts report of 12 June 1812. recommending a Home Department, gave occasion to fill the page of the day, and to enlarge the plan of the memoir to a quire of 48 pages— Mrs William S. Smith dined and spent the day with us. Anthony Giusta, came and bavarded near two hours upon his recovery of 1000 dollars due to him by Gilbert a French Restaurateur who has just absconded.— He undertook to ascertain the current price of Franklin fire insurance company stock I proposed this to him to divert him from the wanderings of his mind which is sinking into sagacious insanity.

O’Clock this evening, and expressing the wish that I would invite the Secretary of the Navy also to attend— I called immediately at Mrs Latimer’s where Mr Bancroft lodges, but he was gone to his office and I found him there.— He agreed to call at my house this evening at 8— I met in the street Mary Cutts who was coming to see our Ladies.— The thermometer was at 80 with a burning Sun. With Walter Hellen I packed up a Chest, 3 feet long 1 foot 6 inches wide, and same deep, (iron key), with Books, Congressional Globe 11 volumes from 3 to 13. Executive Documents—Senate Documents Reports of Committees and Senate and House Journals. 26. Congress. 2. Session. 1840–41.—and 27. Congress 3. Session 1842–43. and Sundry, loose documents and other papers— Seybert’s report of 12 June 1812 in favour of a Home Department, occupied me writing and reading all the leisure of the day— A heavy gust and shower of thunder, lightning and rain continued from 7. to 11 in the evening in the midst of which Mr Bancroft came and went with me to the Patent Office building where we saw the three forms of the Fresnel Lenticular refracting lamps lighted up, in comparison with the old lights with Parabolic reflectors.— Mr Walker the Secretary of the Treasury, and Mr Dallas Vice-President of the United States, and several other gentlemen were there, and expressed much satisfaction at the success of the experiments— I said to Mr Walker that I hoped he would cover with them the whole Coast of the United States. I thought it not creditable to the country to receive visitors from abroad in darkness. Mr Lewis gave us the summary of a lecture explanatory by sundry diagrams the operation of the lense in diffusing and giving intensity to the light.— The principal advantage of refracted over reflected light is that its emanation is seen all round the horizon while reflected light issues only in one direction— Mr Bancroft returned with me, and Benjamin took him to his lodgings at Mrs Latimer’s about 10. He asked me what I thought of the proceedings of the British Parliament, on the reception of Mr Polk’s inaugural address— I gave him my opinions with more freedom than discretion.— Reserve is the first selfish virtue of a politician— Fish for the opinions of others and hide your own.— Our Ladies were disappointed in missing the Ball of Monsieur and Madame de Korponay by the thunder-storm but Walter Hellen went.

The thunder-gust and shower of last evening has purified the atmosphere, with scarcely any abatement of the heat.— I presented my third and final account at the Orphan’s Court as Executor of the Will of Thomas Baker Johnson my wife’s only brother— To this account I was sworn by the Register Edward N. Roach, who closed the account and sent me a copy of it this evening. This conclusion has been delayed since the close of the Session of Congress by my carelessness in not keeping all my private documents and vouchers together— I missed at first the will of Mr Johnson itself. Then the copies of my preceding accounts settled at the Orphans court, and lastly the receipt of Mrs Harriet Boyd and her husband George Boyd for the 80 dollars, her portion of the balance of proceeds of the sale of the personal effects. On ransacking the valise of private vouchers I found the copies of the accounts, and the copy of the Will, and probate in the small quarto manuscript volume, and on rummaging my files of Letters received last winter I found that from Mrs Boyd with the receipt pinned into it.— The Will, and inventories and first account, as stated by the Register, and settled are yet missing— I drew up my third account and presented it to the Register, with the receipt of Mr and Mrs Boyd— The Register made out the Statement according to the official forms— At the Office of the National Intelligencer I exchanged the paper of Monday 14. for that of Monday last— At the Franklin Insurance Office Mr Grammer the President told me, he thought there would be a dividend of 5 per cent next month and the stock might then be sold at par.— Mr Frye had asked me for a Deed to Mr T. B. Johnson of a lot of land which by his will he bequeathed to Thomas B. J. Frye. On looking over Mr Johnson’s papers I found the deed and took it this afternoon to Mr Fryes house, and delivered it to him.— I found also an unsigned certificate of 3. shares in the Bank of the United States. Mr Frye told me there had been an explanatory order issued this day by the Secretary of War requiring the attendance of the Clerks from half past 8 in the morning till half past 3. P.M—but the Offices must be kept open till 6— A man from Syracuse in the State of New-York a democrat and mail contractor, came to see me as a curiosity—very civil and respectful, much attached to Mr Van Buren—thinks not much of Captain Tyler, but goes for Polk and Dallas because they could be elected— Dr Thomas was here— My thumb is still inflamed and unavailable— The Doctor’s remedy this day is to steep it twice in lye as hot as it could bear, and cover it with a poultice of lye on going to bed— This was accordingly done— Mrs Goods is confined to her chamber and much to her bed— My wife is now my nurse.— The Patent Office works hard.

                "text": "27. V:15. Sunday.  At the second Presbyterian Church Mr Knox preached from John 4.24 “God is a Spirit.” and he commented largely and well upon the opposite and united natures of Spirit and Matter, incomprehensibly united in the living creature man, still more wonderfully combined in the person of Jesus Christ—separated according to all outward appearance forever by death, and yet to be reunited by faith in the resurrection of the body, the heaviest tax upon faith of the whole doctrine of Christianity. God is a Spirit—but divest him of the human form, and what conception of him remains— of him? why him? Milton says that Spirits can assume either sex at pleasure—but how does he know that? Christ himself taught us to call God our father? can we call him our mother? Yet we are told that Jesus himself was the only begotten son of God— How can we conceive of God as a Spirit, without losing ourselves in pantheism? God as a Spirit is infinite? where is its location? and how can Spirit act upon matter but by material instruments?— This is the chapter in which Jesus reveals himself in direct averment to the woman of Samaria that he is the Messias—the Christ—the anointed— This amazing revelation he makes in a manner equally astonishing by accosting at Jacob’s well, a Samaritan woman and asking her to give him water to drink— The whole dialogue is incomprehensibly wonderful— The Samaritans were converted by his knowledge of the Samaritan woman’s secret adventures—and by his discourses. The Galileans by his exercise of power in healing the nobleman’s son who lay at the point of death at Capernaum— But in Judea, Jesus testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country— The surprize of the woman that Jesus, a Jew, should ask a draught of water from her, a Samaritan, shews in blazing proof the bitter hatred between those two fragments of one family. Mr Knox prayed for Mr M’lellan; not that he might recover, which he considered past praying for, but that he might have an easy passage to the better world— After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Pyne read the evening service for the 5th. Sunday after Easter, and preached from 1. Thessalonians 5.7. “For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and that be drunken are drunken in the Night. 8. But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith, and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.” The doctrine was that the Sleepers and the Drunkards were only two classes of enemies of Christ and his gospel. The first cold, indifferent and heedless; the second positively depraved and vicious— The services were partially interrupted by a sudden very heavy thunder gust, with a shower and floods of rain— I was detained about a quarter of an hour after church for the rain to subside.

Mrs Royall called on me this morning and said she was on the way to see Mr Buchanan, the Secretary of State on business— But he would not be at the Department till 10 O’Clock, and in the meantime she wanted to have a talk with me— This woman has made herself conspicuous these 20 years by publishing gossiping travels about the country, and editing a weekly newspaper under a succession of different names.— She has a claim before Congress for a pension as widow of a revolutionary Officer, which has passed the house at one Session and the Senate at another, but is yet pending.— She took leave of me now saying she supposed she should never see me again— Clampett is a man authorised to go round and collect contributions for a Sunday school church which goes by the name of the M’Kendrick chapel. Campbell was here—he wanted to authenticate his own and his wife’s execution of a power to her father Charles Harrod at New-Orleans to act for them in the conveyance of a deed He asked my advice, by whom to authenticate this power— I advised him to ascertain if there were a commissioner here appointed by the Governor of Louisiana to authenticate deeds of Lands in that State and if not, I supposed Callan the notary competent to do it— I called at the Bank of the Metropolis Bank and shewed Mr Richard Smith the Certificate for 3 shares in the stock of the Bank of the United States in the name of Thomas B. Johnson, sealed but not signed— Mr Smith said the certificate was good. At the Department of State Mr Derrick now acting under Mr Buchanan as chief clerk furnished me such information as he could find upon the files in answer to my enquiries concerning the patent office.— He gave me a list of the Clerks who made out the Patents from 1790. till the appointment of Dr Thornton in 1802— Also the dates of the appointments of Thomas P. Jones 12. April 1828. John D. Craig 11 June 1829. J. C. Pickett 1. Feby 1835. Thomas John’s acting Superintendant from 2. May to 30. June 1835—Henry L. Ellsworth Superintendant from 30. June 1835 to 5. April 1836. Thomas John’s acting Superintendant from 5 April to 27 May 1836—Henry L. Ellsworth Superintendant from 27 May to 4 July 1836—and then commissioned as Commissioner of the Patent Office under the new list— Mr Derrick also had collected the volumes of documents containing the annual reports of the Secretary of State with the Lists of Patents from 1822 to 1837.—with the exception of the year 1832— He afterwards sent me a minute of the volumes—and a copy of the printed interrogatories of the Marshals who took the 6th. census.

I am obliged to break off in the middle with all my occupations here, not knowing what is to be my destiny till the next Session of Congress nor then— Commander Wilkes’s five quarto volumes of narrative have been too ponderous a burden for me to undertake— I leave his 5th. volume to be returned much as it came— I did undertake to read the wandering Jew by Eugene Sue, far famed as a Catapult against the Jesuits but have made not much progress in it— The greatest curiosity in it to me is Dagobert, the Corporal Trim of Napoleon’s armies— President Wayland of Brown University has sent me a copy of his correspondence with the Revd. Richard Fuller of Beaufort South-Carolina, upon domestic Slavery considered as a Scriptural Institution— I am trying to read it— I suppose it conformable to the meek and gentle Spirit of Christianity, to consider Slavery as an institution, but it is impossible for me to consider it in moral principle any other than an institution of burglary, arson or parricide— I suppose a Feejee islander could calmly discuss the institution of eating his father or his son—but a Christian minister of the word of God, who undertakes to prove from Scripture to prove that Slavery is not a moral evil, is in my estimate of human character one degree lower than the Feejee Cannibal.— My friend Dr N. L. Frothingham has sent me his pamphlet Deism or Christianity? Four Discourses, the reading of which I must postpone till I reach Quincy or Boston; and Mr Charles Sumner of Boston has sent me at the request of Mr Thomas Falconer, his pamphlet upon the Oregon question published subsequently to that upon the discovery of the Mississippi and the Oregon lent to me by Mr Pakenham— I answered Mr Sumner’s Letter— I called at the Patent Office and returned the books that I had borrowed there—then at the Capitol, and returned the books borrowed from the Congress and Supreme Court Libraries— At the library of the house I found, my own Reports as Secretary of State with the annual lists of Patents from 1818 to 1825—eight— Those of 1815. 16. and 17. are still to be found—and in 1830. it is doubtful whether the list was returned— Dr Thomas was here; and advised me to use the lunar caustic to my thumb, which continues swollen and inflamed but neither comes to a head nor disperses— I preferred patience two or three days longer; before trying the caustic— As I have concluded to depart for home to-morrow, my historical memoir on the patent Office must be suspended, but I have continued it down to this day, and am engaged in a discussion upon constitutional scruples concerning the act of Congress of 21. January 1808 for the relief of Oliver Evans. "

                "text": "1. V. Thursday.  At 6 O’Clock this morning the Steamboat Constitution Captain Chaytor parted from the wharf at Baltimore, and at a quarter past ten landed her passengers at Frenchtown.— This line was for some years broken up by the Railway, from Baltimore to Philadelphia, which is a less agreeable mode of performing the journey, but traverses the distance in nearly two hours less of time— Governor Gibbs preferred to go by the Railway which starts at 9. O’Clock.— Another Steamer, the Thomas Jefferson left the adjoining wharf immediately after us, an opposition line, and the competition has reduced the fare in both so that they take only one dollar for the whole passage— From ten to thirteen minutes were consumed in passing from the Steamer to the Cars at Frenchtown, and from the Cars to the Steamer George Washington, on the Delaware river at Newcastle, 47 minutes for the passage of the Cars from Frenchtown to Newcastle— And then three hours from New-castle to the wharf at the foot of Dock Street Philadelphia, where I landed at 20 minutes past 2.— 8 hours and 15 minutes for the whole passage smooth and without accident— The Passengers in the boat were all strangers to me, but one and another, came and shook hands with me, some of them claiming to have done so before, and even to be old acquaintances. One man especially, named Pettis, an Englishman born as he told me, but now and for many years past a resident of Philadelphia, amused and wearied me with talking about Pennsylvania politics heavily to the charge of the late Governor Porter said to have worried himself into that Office poor as a church rat and to go out of it with half a million of dollars— At Philadelphia, I left my trunks in charge of Benjamin to be transferred to the other boat and strolled up the Street— There was a sprinkling of rain which did not amount to a shower— I called at the Bank of North-America, and took a draft for 120 dollars on the Atlantic Bank in Boston, for 4 coupons of Cincinnati Bonds of 30 dollars each, payable this day— After wandering round the city about an hour, and picking up, in and around the Statehouse yard half a dozen white maple seeds I came down to the corner shop of the Walnut Street house, where I met and had some small talk with Mr Dayton, U.S. Senator from New-Jersey.— Benjamin had got the baggage on board the Steamer New Philadelphia— Governor Gibbs, who had come on by the railway soon joined us, and also Mr Burche, from Washington this morning.— Saw Mrs William Biddle who came down to take leave of her brother Oliver Hopkinson, just married and going with his bride to New-Jersey. At 5. we left the wharf. At dusk of Evening passed from the Steamer to the Railway Cars at Bristol; came through Trenton, Princeton, Brunswick, Rahway, Elizabeth town to Jersey city— Crossed the ferry, and walked with Governor Gibbs to the Astor house which we entered at a quarter past 11. P.M— "

On rising this morning I found I had left my steel pen on the table of my chamber at Baltimore, or had lost it from my waistcoat pocket— I sallied forth till I found a Stationer’s shop and purchased a paper of Gillott’s Victoria pens with a holder— Then returned to my chamber and wrote till the sound of the second gong, at half past 7. summoned me to the gentlemen’s breakfast table— The hour of departure of the Long-island rail-road line being changed from 8 to 10.

Johnson’s Office was at N. 48 Wall Street I went there to find him— He was not there but his partner Mr Hurlbut told me, he would write him a note and inform him that I wished to see him.— I returned to my chamber at the Astor-House and wrote till 3. Letter to my wife— Alexander S. Johnson, and sat till the dinner gong of the gentlemen’s table sounded— He promised to come and visit us again at Quincy in the course of the Summer. Just before dinner Mr Joseph Grinnell came in— He was going for Boston in the Steamer Massachusetts at 5 this afternoon and could not change his conveyance to go with us, because he said he wanted to be early in the morning at Boston.— We dined at the Astor-house with a company of about 158 men, all strangers, and I walked with Governor Gibbs to Pier N. 3. in the North River near the Battery, and embarked in the Steamer Neptune Captain Rollins at 5. minutes past 5 she loosened from the wharf, with the Steamer Massachusetts from the other side of the wharf close at her stern. They passed round the battery into the East-river, through hell-gate, by Sands’s point into Long-island Sound— The whole day and evening were of the fairest and brightest of the Spring with dewy fingers cold that I ever witnessed. The waters were smooth, the breeze light and fair, and as night advanced we glided along by the Long-island shores, passing successively by the Lights of Huntington and Crane neck, and seeing the Long-island woods in four different places blazing with fire— Among the passengers who were not numerous, Mr M. M. Fisher of Medway named himself to me and introduced his Son, a beautiful boy 7 years old. Mrs Fisher was home— About 10. I turned into my berth in a State-room. "

                "text": "4. IV:45. Sunday.  Attended public worship at the first Congregational Church in Chauncey place Dr. Nathaniel L. Frothingham performed the service and administered the communion. The text of his morning sermon was Mark 14.25. “Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.” The mind of Dr Frothingham is of a cast so original that I never heard from him otherwise than as a quotation or direct reference a thought which I had heard from any other source. How a most impressive and deeply pathetic communion Sermon, could be constructed from this text I could not imagine— Yet so it was. Dr Frothingham observed that the minute incident recorded in this had seldom been commented on; but that no incident of that transcendently memorable event the institution of the last Supper was to be overlooked, and it deserved reflection and enquiry why Jesus at that moment formed and declared to his disciples this determination; and why in the recorded words— They occur immediately after his distribution of the bread as his body, and of the wine as his blood; and after he had declared that one of the 12 would betray him— From a variety in the narrative as related in another gospel, (Luke 22.17–18) it was inferred that Jesus did not himself drink of that cup—but told his disciples to take it, and divide it among themselves— The Resolution to drink no more before his death, and to drink it afterwards now in the kingdom of God, were shewn to be all typical and significant— He described the contrast between the cruel and ignominious death he was about to suffer, and the sequel of glory and power in the kingdom of God. This view of the text opened the way for new, and beautiful developements of the character of Jesus Christ and of his religion— He said there had been opinions by some that the body of Christ which suffered crucifixion was not the same with that in which he afterwards manifested himself to his disciples— He utterly disclaimed referring to his reply to the incredulity of Thomas, and to his eating in the presence of the disciples—he cautioned against skeptical scrutinies into the mystery of the resurrection of the body which there is no necessity that we should understand, and which no man in this life ever will understand— Dr Frothingham administered the communion with a degree of solemnity beyond anything that I had ever witnessed, and which impressed me with awe— My Son and his wife participated with me in taking it— After dinner Dr. Frothingham’s text was from 1. Kings 17.14. “For thus saith the Lord God of Israel. The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.” An exquisite discourse upon Faith. The affecting incidents of this story are so numerous and so varied, that talents incomparably inferior could easily extract a good sermon from them. I watched for—thought that I could trace to Sterne’s sermon upon the same text, but there was not one— Call of Miss Harriet Welsh upon Mrs C. F. Adams— We spent the Evening at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s— His Son Edward, and grandson Henry were there— I rode home with Mrs Charles. "

                "text": "5. IV:30. Monday.  Benjamin came this morning, and I paid him his wages and discharged him— I had given him notice of this before we left Washington— He now said that he had no wish to part from me, and I had not told him why I dismissed him— I said it gave me no pleasure, and I might perhaps so far as concerned myself have overlooked the cause— It was his habit of absenting himself without asking leave— It had so often happened that the Carriage was wanted and could not be used because he was out, that I had concluded it was best that we should part— He said he acknowledged that he had given some occasion for complaint in that respect, but he was under some apprehension that my Son had taken some prejudice against him— I assured him, that my Son had used no influence against him whatever— He pressed the matter no further, and withdrew with my best wishes for his welfare— The relation of master and servant, imports a degree of dependence which the proud spirits of our people cannot brook. He never thought of asking leave to go out, and often indulged himself without enquiring whether he would be wanted or not. Louisa C. Smith called to see us this morning— Before dinner I walked out, and after some search found the Atlantic Bank and received bills for the draft from the Bank of North-America at Philadelphia— At the Office of the Morning Chronicle and Emancipator I saw Mr Leavitt and enquired for the manuscript copies of the proceedings of the U.S. District and Circuit Courts in the case of the Antelope, for which I had written to Mr Reverdy Johnson and spoken to Mr Gallagher without success.— I said I wanted to have them returned, expecting that at the next Session of Congress, the bill for granting 70000 dollars to the Slave-traders Ruiz and Montes, will be again brought in, and I shall want these Antelope case papers to use in the endeavour to defeat it. Mr Leavitt said he would write to Mr Torrey and enquire if he has them. Mr Leavitt read to me an article in the Cincinnati Morning Herald noticing a Card ofThomasson in a Louisville Newspaper acknowledging that he assented to report the Bill to indemnify the owners of the Amistad, but that he had no knowledge of the falsification of the date— That not having an exact recollection of the Report he could not say what it was, but if it was correct as to the facts, he approved the bill— Such is Thomasson! Mr Leavitt also read to me part of a Letter that he had received from Rio de Janeiro containing a more minute and particular account of Wise’s flare-up at Rio de Janeiro than any yet published, but which has left to this day unpublished, from an underestimate of its importance Mr P. C. Brooks was here this afternoon—and Mr Colton, eager for the Lecture on Society and civilization—and Mr Felt going with his wife to Europe and asking for a Letter of Recommendation to Lord Aberdeen— I could not.

                "text": "7. IV:45 Wednesday.  President Quincy called on me this morning to converse upon the subject of the new astronomical observatory— A considerable sum of money was raised by subscription to erect the building. Then another for the purchase of a Frauenhofer refractor—and now other instruments are needed; but especially an Observator.— Mr William Cranch Bond, and his son are there— They occupy the house; but no provision is made for their compensation— I am by election of the board of Overseers a member of the Committee to inspect the Observatory, and a duty thereby devolves upon me— Mr Benjamin Peirce, professor of Astronomy and Mathematics (Perkins) told me yesterday that they had in the morning observed an eclipse of the Sun, and that there would be a transit of Mercury over the disk of the Sun to-morrow from about Noon to 6. P.M— I told him if the sky should be clear I would come and see it— Mr Quincy came to make arrangements for going with me— He thought it would be necessary to be there at an earlier hour than noon, but said he would enquire of Professor Peirce, and if the transit should begin earlier he would write to me— I have many enquiries which I ought to make, and much which I ought to do to give a proper direction to this establishment— I called twice at Dr George Parkman’s, but he was not at home; at Robert C. Winthrop’s, and sat an hour with him— At Mr James H. Foster’s, where I saw his three daughters, and Louisa C. Smith— He and Mrs Foster were not at home— I afterwards met and spoke with her in the street— At judge John Davis’s, and his brother Isaac P. Davis’s neither of whom was at home— As I went out I met Dr Frothingham who was bringing for my perusal several numbers of Brownson’s periodical, and after my return Dr George Parkman came and passed half an hour with me. My Son went out to Quincy and returned before dinner.— I received a Letter from my wife, dated on Monday, and one from Walter Hellen enclosing a Baltimore Sun, and the second number of the Daily Union, the Newspaper which has taken the place of the Globe as a Government paper. This has become an affair of State under the new Administration, a subject of cabinet consultations and of complicated cabalistic intrigues— Blair and Rives have made magnificent fortunes by the Globe, bolstered up by the printing of Congress, and Mr Polk has a typographical sycophant to whom he must secure a like portion of the public plunder. Thomas Ritchie Editor of the Richmond Enquire was also to be bought and the Editors of the Globe have been compelled to sell their whole establishment to this new Company— I dined with Charles at Mr Peter C. Brook’s— His Sons, Edward, Peter C. and his wife, Sidney and his wife, and Dr. Frothingham were there—and Mr Rives, son of the late Senator from Virginia, and Secretary of Legation under Edward Everett, whence he arrived in the Hibernia— We spent the Evening at Mr Robert C. Winthrop’s, with the Wednesday Evening club. "

                "text": "8. IV:45. Thursday  Transit of Mercury  There was rain in the Night and a flight of snow this morning, with a thrilling, chilling North-east wind, the whole day. I hesitated all the morning, whether to go to Cambridge at-all or to give up in despair the hope ever to see the planet Mercury on the disk of the Sun. About 10. O’Clock the Orb of day peered out from his curtain cloud, and shone 4 or 5 minutes on the table on which I was writing, and I concluded to go— As I was going from the house, Mr Colton the Editor of the New American Review, came in, and told me he was going this afternoon for New-York, and enquired if I had written to obtain permission from the Lyceum at Waltham to allow him to publish the Lecture on Society and Civilization. I told him I would write in a few days— I asked him to send me 25 copies of the engraved likeness from Marchant’s portrait in the May number of the American Review, which he promised— I went to Cambridge in the quarter-hourly omnibus, and alighted at President Quincy’s house at half-past 11. He had given up all expectation of seeing me, but immediately ordered his buggy, and took me to the observatory now the dwelling house of Mr Bond—we reached it just at noon. Professor Peirce was in the upper story of the tower, under a temporary immovable wooden roof, observing with an old clumsy English telescope about six feet long; a small brass tubed French Telescope by Le Rebours, with a rock crystal object glass, instead of flint, and a small azimuth and altitude instrument by Ertel and Son, the most convenient instrument for celestial observation that I ever saw.— The observer sits in a chair, looks horizontally through the eye-glass, and by means of an internal mirror sees the object in the sky projected as on the side of a wall.— In this manner I saw the Planet several times as the clouds flitted off an on over the face of the Sun. The planet was a small spot coal-black of the apparent size and shape of a pea on a buff-coloured Sun’s disk— There were two darks spots on the other side of the disk— Mr Bond the father was in a small tentlike wooden shed in the yard, apart from the tower and the house observing the planet with Commander Wilkes, keeping time for him with a sidereal clock.— The observations with this instrument were made, kneeling on cushions, and with the head thrown back so that I could not endure it. I saw nothing except by the horizontal instrument— At the contact of the Planet with the Sun the sky was beclouded— They saw the planet about 7 minutes before, and 15 minutes after the contact—when I saw them the planet had advanced from 3 to 4 digits upon the disk— Between one and two, I returned with President Quincy, and dined with him, Mrs Quincy, and their daughters Susan and Abigail at his house, whence he took me back after dinner to my Son’s house 57. Mount Vernon Street— I met Charles’s wife with Mrs Frothingham, crossing the West Boston Bridge, in the Barouche, going to take me up at President Quincy’s, and to bring me back— I received a note from judge Davis, with the illustrated London News of 19. April 1845 containing a Letter from Sir James South, and a long description and plates of the Monster Telescope of Lord Rosse. "

I hesitated all the morning, whether to go to Cambridge at-all or to give up in despair the hope ever to see the planet Mercury on the disk of the Sun. About 10. O’Clock the Orb of day peered out from his curtain cloud, and shone 4 or 5 minutes on the table on which I was writing, and I concluded to go— As I was going from the house, Mr Colton the Editor of the New American Review, came in, and told me he was going this afternoon for New-York, and enquired if I had written to obtain permission from the Lyceum at Waltham to allow him to publish the Lecture on Society and Civilization. I told him I would write in a few days— I asked him to send me 25 copies of the engraved likeness from Marchant’s portrait in the May number of the American Review, which he promised— I went to Cambridge in the quarter-hourly omnibus, and alighted at President Quincy’s house at half-past 11. He had given up all expectation of seeing me, but immediately ordered his buggy, and took me to the observatory now the dwelling house of Mr Bond—we reached it just at noon. Professor Peirce was in the upper story of the tower, under a temporary immovable wooden roof, observing with an old clumsy English telescope about six feet long; a small brass tubed French Telescope by Le Rebours, with a rock crystal object glass, instead of flint, and a small azimuth and altitude instrument by Ertel and Son, the most convenient instrument for celestial observation that I ever saw.— The observer sits in a chair, looks horizontally through the eye-glass, and by means of an internal mirror sees the object in the sky projected as on the side of a wall.— In this manner I saw the Planet several times as the clouds flitted off an on over the face of the Sun. The planet was a small spot coal-black of the apparent size and shape of a pea on a buff-coloured Sun’s disk— There were two darks spots on the other side of the disk— Mr Bond the father was in a small tentlike wooden shed in the yard, apart from the tower and the house observing the planet with Commander Wilkes, keeping time for him with a sidereal clock.— The observations with this instrument were made, kneeling on cushions, and with the head thrown back so that I could not endure it. I saw nothing except by the horizontal instrument— At the contact of the Planet with the Sun the sky was beclouded— They saw the planet about 7 minutes before, and 15 minutes after the contact—when I saw them the planet had advanced from 3 to 4 digits upon the disk— Between one and two, I returned with President Quincy, and dined with him, Mrs Quincy, and their daughters Susan and Abigail at his house, whence he took me back after dinner to my Son’s house 57. Mount Vernon Street— I met Charles’s wife with Mrs Frothingham, crossing the West Boston Bridge, in the Barouche, going to take me up at President Quincy’s, and to bring me back— I received a note from judge Davis, with the illustrated London News of 19. April 1845 containing a Letter from Sir James South, and a long description and plates of the Monster Telescope of Lord Rosse. "

April last, containing the Letter of Sir James South, of the royal observatory Kensington, upon the Earl of Rosse’s monster or Leviathan Telescope at Parsonstown, Ireland— This instrument with a speculum of 6 feet diameter, and 54 feet diameter is represented as likely to produce new and wonderful discoveries in the firmament— I read Sir James South’s Letter with reference to the wood cuts and diagram, but without understanding the mechanism, or what is the construction of the Newtonian, or the Le Mairean, Telescopes, and many other things in the Letter— At 11. O’Clock this morning at the chambers of the Massachusetts historical Society judge John Davis, and Mr James Savage the President of the Society. We were appointed at the last meeting of the Society a Committee to report upon a Letter from John Jay corresponding Secretary of the New-York historical Society, enclosing a printed report of David Dudley Field, Henry R. Schoolcraft, and Charles Fenno Hoffman, a Committee of that Society, made on the 31st. of March last, on a proposal for devising and promulgating a national name for the United States— Mr Savage read the Letter from Mr Jay, and the report of the New-York Committee which proposes that the name to be assumed by the United States should be Allegania, or by abbreviation Algania— The report is well written, and urges many grave and forcible considerations for desiring to have a national name— We agreed at once that this was a sort of literary trifling which could only cover us with ridicule; and that our only proper course would be to frame a declining answer avoiding all offense to the correspondent, or to the New-York Society or their committee— Mr Jay the corresponding Secretary suggests a preference for the name of the republic of Washington; but we are averse to taking any measure upon the subject as utterly beyond our competency. I was charged to prepare an answer to the Letter of Mr Jay, to be reported to our Society at the next monthly meeting on the 29th. of this month, and judge Davis engaged Mr Savage and me to dine with him on the 22d. then to revise my draft to be reported— I dined with my Son at Mr Robert G. Shaw’s—at a dinner of the Directors of the humane Society. Besides us the company consisted of Charles Amory, Nathan Appleton, Saml T. Armstrong, Peter C. Brooks, Commodore Downs, Gardner, T. C. Grattan, DrHayward, Homans, Hooper,Lowell, Josiah Quincy, Dr Robbins,Russell, Son of Jonathan David Sears, Mr. and Mrs Shaw, their Son, and daughter, and Mr Truman— Dr George Parkman, was with us until we went to the dinner table when he withdrew from a necessity of abstemious regimen—he walked home with me— Mr Shaw is taxed in Boston for 600000 dollars or more— He lives in one of the magnificent houses of Boston and on a splendid establishment— Mr Brooks came home with Charles, and spent the Evening with us— I wrote to the Revd Samuel Ripley of Waltham.

A. Wise, in his published correspondence, as deeply implicated in the Slave-trade.— Just before reaching home I met also Mr Edward Brooks, who had called to see me, and left for my perusal a Letter to him from Jos. Coolidge, dated at Dresden 7. Feby 1845. and requesting him to inform me of the very kind and friendly recollections of me expressed to him by Mr F. R.

Her daughter Elizabeth C. almost as much reduced herself, and her Sister, Mrs Stebbins are with her— We returned to Boston at the dusk. "

The night before last there was a sharp frost—our ride to Quincy last evening was so chilling that we exchanged the barouche for a close carriage to return— Early this morning, Fahrenheit was at 80 and through the day at 85. I attended public worship at the first congregational church. Dr Frothingham officiated at the morning service, and preached from Acts 2.37— “Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?” He began by observing that this was the day of the festival called in the jewish ritual Pentecost, and in the language of the English episcopal church Whitsunday— Celebrated as the anniversary of the day upon which the apostles received the miraculous gift of tongues, and from which the existence of the Christian church is to be dated— He said that the denomination to which we belong had disused the celebration of all the fasts and festivals of other christian churches, he thought it proper to notice them as they pass, and without dwelling upon the wonderful incidents of that memorable day, he thought the question at the close of the text by that vast assemblage to the apostles—what shall we do? eminently suitable for us all, at all times to put to ourselves.— And then after referring to the threefold definition of eloquence by Demosthenes, as consisting all in action he considered it equally applicable to the whole duty of man. An excellent discourse of exhortation to virtuous action followed, worthy of leaving abundant fruit in the lives of his hearers— Returning home I met Dr George Parkman who walked with me to Charles’s door.— and before dinner I received visits from Mr B. W. Crowninshield, and from Dr Bigelow—the former an old friend whom I had not seen for several years.— In the afternoon I heard the Revd. Samuel K. Lothrop of the Brattle Street church, who exchanged with Dr Frothingham— His text was from Proverbs 16.31. “The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.” The discourse was a moral Dissertation upon the condition, the obligations, the rights, the infirmities and the enjoyments of Old age— A religious aspect was given to the whole subject, and the obvious topics were handled with ingenuity, earnestness of manner and elegance of composition.— Mr Lothrop’s style is at once chaste, pure and ornamental.— There was a disastrous fire raging all the time of the afternoon service, and for an hour after, at the South side of the City near the Neck which burnt upwards of 30 houses and a Methodist church— Mr Degrand visited us in the early part of the Evening, and we spent the latter part of it at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s— Dr Bigelow and Mr Frank Brooks second son of Edward were there—with the family Peter C junr and his wife, and Miss Lydia Phillips. I finished reading Dr Frothingham’s 4 Discourses—Deism or Christianity?   "

I was awaked this morning before four O’Clock by the ringing of Bells for a fire, and on rising saw from the chamber window the smoke of it North and West of it in the direction of Charlestown—in the opposite quarter of the city from that of yesterday’s fire— There were two other alarms in the course of this day, and the people are so habituated to the cry that it scarcely produces a sensation— Immediately after breakfast, two gentlemen who introduced each other, Mr Coolidge and Mr Pray came to enquire if I had received some weeks since an invitation to preside at a meeting of the Unitarians of this city to entertain with a collation, the clergymen, and their wives of that denomination, who come from all parts of the Commonwealth, in the last week of this month—to attend various annual religious celebrations— I had received the invitation, and had delayed the answer under some uncertainty whether it would be in my power to comply with the request. Although a communicant of a church with a unitarian pastor, my own opinions were not exactly conformable to those of either division of the Unitarian churches Neither Arian nor Socinian.— My creed was negative— Not Trinitarian—but who and what the self declared son of God and son of Man was, is a mystery not revealed to me, and the revelation of which I hope is not necessary for salvation— I had attended a Lord’s day convention at Baltimore, as a delegate from a strictly Calvinistic Presbyterian Church, though a member not of the church but of the Society— I had presided over that Convention—and their address to the People was signed by me as their President— There was no Unitarian Minister, or Delegate at that Convention, although there is a respectable Unitarian Church and Minister, Mr Burnap at Baltimore— In presiding over this convivial Unitarian assembly I should not be understood as intending any inconsistency with the part I had taken in the convention at Baltimore.— They said they were sure that no such inference could be drawn, and that they had been highly gratified by the part that I had taken in that convention— With some further explanations I promised a written invitation answer to the invitation in the course of a few days— President Quincy was here, and appointed Friday morning next at 11. O’Clock for a meeting of the Committee of the Overseers, at the Observatory at Cambridge and that he had seen Mr Abbott Lawrence who had promised to go, and to take me with him— Mr Sears, also a member of the Committee afterwards called and offered to take me with him— I walked out and took two Letters to the Post-Office, with Fahrenheit at 90— Met Isaac P. Davis in State Street— Then Abbott Lawrence with whom I walked to his new Counting house in Milk Street— I called at judge John Davis’s but he was not at home— The burning heat of the Sun housed me for the remnant of the day.

Tuesday—  Fahrenheit was yesterday at 90 on the shady side of State-Street— This day it was at 50— These 40 degrees constitute the average difference between a South west, and a Northeast wind in Boston, through the month of May— My visits this morning were first to Cadmus—then to Doctor Frothingham, with whom I had a long Conversation upon his four Discourses on Deism or Christianity?— Mrs Frothingham being present till she tired out and re-tired— The text of his 3d Discourse (the Difference), is “whom do men say that I, the son of man am?”— I observed that there was a subsequent question, but whom say ye that I am? I did not find in his Discourses his answer to that question— He said it was explicitly there—that he believed him to be merely a man— I said I would read the discourse again,—he asked me to read a manuscript Sermon of his, upon the Creation by Jesus Christ, which I promised— He sent it this afternoon, and I read it this evening without conviction— My next call was upon judge Davis with whom I conversed upon Astronomy, and Lord Rosse’s Leviathan Telescope— He asked me to read to me an Article in the French methodical Encyclopaedia, maintaining that the scintillation of the large fixed Stars, is merely the interception of their rays by vapours in the atmosphere, and that in regions of clear skies there is no scintillation— He lent me a pamphlet recently published at New-York “Popular Lectures on Astronomy,[”] by M. Arago—with additions and corrections, by Dionysius Lardner L.L.D.—to which I gave a small portion of the evening.— I then sought and found Charles Sumner at his Office in Court Street N. 4. after passing through Mr Hillard’s Office in the same building.— with both these gentlemen, I had a conversation upon political subjects—Mexico and Texas—England, Oregon and Canada. Mr Sumner told me that he was personally acquainted with Mr Thomas Falconer at whose request he had sent me his pamphlet on the Oregon question— He said Mr Falconer had been in this country and he thought had been introduced to me at Washington— After dinner, Charles and his wife with their daughter Louisa went out to Quincy, and returned not before 8 in the evening— Louisa C. Smith had dined here— Mr Peter C. Brooks came about 5. in the afternoon, and remained with me till, Charles and Abby came home, and then to tea— He removes to Medford for the Summer, to-morrow. Between 9 and 10. this evening Miss Harriet Welsh came in accompanied by Mr and Mrs John Peter De Windt of Cedar grove, Fishkill Landing, New-York. They came from New-York city yesterday, and propose to return thither to-morrow.— I received a monitory letter from my wife. "

The Summer atmosphere prevailed again this day and the weather was soft and the air balmy with Fahrenheit from 75 to 80— I received a printed circular invitation signed T. Bulfinch recording Secretary to attend the exercise of the annual meeting of the Boston Society of Natural History, at its Hall in Tremont Street at 4. O’Clock this afternoon— I finished my record of yesterday very soon after breakfast, intending to write a draft of an answer to the New-York Historical Society upon the proposal to adopt a National name.— But my reading propensities are already stimulated by such a multitude and variety of subjects, that the noiseless foot of Time stole on my firm resolves unperceived.— The Newspapers swallow up from one to two hours with matter as evanescent as the smell of roses; and I have on my table, besides the Bible, Sparks’s American Biography. 16 volumes, with 4 or 5 lives entamés, and unfinished—one volume, and the last two numbers of Brownson’s quarterly Review— Volume 1. part 3 of Henry Colman’s European Agriculture and rural economy— Elliot’s list of Patents and copy-right books, printed in 1823. lent me by Mr Derrick the Chief Clerk of the State Department; and the popular Lectures on Astronomy, of Arago and Lardner, lent me yesterday by judge Davis— Besides these Charles has at least as many reading traps on his table— Among them are the American republication of the Edinburg Review of October 1844 and January 1845— I took up this morning the October number, and reading the first paragraph of the last Article—on the early administrations of George the 3d. it stole 3 hours of my time to read it through— It was past one before I went out and called first at the house of Mr Sears who was not at home—then of Mr H. G. Otis, who returning from a ride in his carriage met me at his door— He has turned the corner of four score. Has suffered much from gout at various periods of his life but is now in promising health and cheerful Spirits. He told me he was going this afternoon to Newport with his daughter Mrs Ritchie. My last morning visit was to Dr George Parkman; and Mrs Parkman who has been much indisposed with an inflammation of the lungs, but now convalescent. Dr Parkman walked home with me— At 4. in the afternoon I attended the anniversary Meeting of the Boston Society of Natural History.— Their Hall is over the Apartments of the Massachusetts historical Society, in the same building— There was an introductory Address from the President of the Society, Amos Binney— Reports from the Treasurer and Secretary, and an Address upon the History of the Science of Natural History, from Aristotle down to Cuvier—by the Revd. Charles Brooks— Sidney Brooks spent an hour of the evening here.— Charles with his daughter went to a concert of Signor de Begnis. "

In addition to the multitude of subjects which as noted yesterday distract my attention and absorb my time, I received this day a Letter from John Jay, with a Volume containing the proceedings of the New-York Historical Society 1844. and from President Quincy, his Speech made on the 25th. of February last to the board of Overseers of Harvard University, on the minority Report by George Bancroft, of the Committee of Visitation.— Besides which I found in the Edinburgh Review for last October, on the recent developements of Puseyism, which is agitating violently the church of England, nor inconsiderably the religious world of this country— It is a review of ten pamphlets recently published in England by the parties to this controversy, in which Oxford Faith is treading back her steps to Rome, attesting all her fraudulent miracles, and swallowing all her absurd and senseless doctrines.— I read of this article till I dosed and dropped the book; whereupon I took refuge in the popular Lectures of Arago and Lardner.— I walked out and returned by cards the visits of Francis C. Gray, and B W. Crowninshield neither of whom was at home— I wrote with sluggish aversion two pages of the draft for an answer to the proposal of the New-York historical Society to promulgate a National name— I had received an invitation to attend at 7 this evening the Dedication of the Hall of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, recently erected upon the spot where the Latin School house has heretofore stood from time immemorial— It was a religious ceremony— Introduced by a few words from M. P. Wilder, President of the Society. A Song and Chorus— Flora’s invitation—written by Thomas Power— Sentences from Scripture—all, about gardens and flowers, read by Revd. George Putnam Unitarian Minister at Roxbury— 4. Prayer by Revd. William M. Rogers, Trinitarian Minister of Winter Street church. 5. Original Hymn by Revd. William Croswell, Episcopal Minister 6. Address by Hon. George Lunt of Newburyport— Highly poetical and eloquent— Desultory, as no otherwise it could be, exhausting all the sources of eulogy upon the floral branch of horticulture, but overlooking its property of bearing fruit— The garden includes fruit as well as flowers and the tree of knowledge was in the garden of Eden— 7. A Stanza—sung by Flora, and the whole audience to the tune of Old hundred. 8. A benediction in the name of the Trinity, by the Revd. Mr Rogers— The hall was crowded with a respectable auditory. Governor Briggs—Lieutt. Governor Read and four members of the Council were there— Mr Wilder presented me a very beautiful bouquet. Mr Samuel T. Armstrong and Mr. Read walked home with me. Charles and his wife spent the evening abroad. "

                "text": "17. IV:30. Saturday.  The cold North-east storm continued the whole of last Night and of this day— The Steamer Hibernia departed in the midst of it yesterday for Halifax and Liverpool with 112 passengers. It must be a tremendous gale upon the coast. I was not interrupted by any visitor at home, but before dinner I walked down into Milk Street to see Mr Abbott Lawrence at his new Counting house.— In such weather I expected to find him without other visitors, but at the door I met two of the Ex-Mayors of the city, Mr Brimmer and Mr Chapman who went with me, and with whom he held consultation in the general counting room, shewing me into his private chamber— The object of the two Mayors was the formation of a company with a capital of half a million of dollars, for building a Hotel surpassing in dimensions either the Tremont house of this city or the Astor house of New-York— Their interview was not long, and he came in to me— I told him that I had this establishment of an Astronomical observatory at Cambridge very much at heart, and wanted the earnest and zealous exertion of his influence for its consummation in the most effective manner possible— That I believed much would depend upon the report of the Committee of the board of Overseers to be made next February; reminding him of the suggestions that I had thrown out yesterday at the meeting of the Committee, I said I was preparing a Letter to President Quincy, submitting to him in behalf of the Committee a number of specific enquiries for information to enable them to make a satisfactory report to the board, and also to fortify their address to the public for a further contribution to complete the establishment of the observatory.— And I wished to see him for half an hour to communicate to him this Letter.—He agreed to see me at his house next Monday Morning at 9. O’Clock— He said he saw this was a matter for posterity, and he wished me to make a report that would be read in foreign countries and in after ages— I said that without indulging such aspirations, my purpose was to stimulate President to prepare a report, to be presented by the Committee, perhaps with some remarks of their own to the board for reference hereafter to this whole undertaking of superadding an Astronomical Observatory to the institution of Harvard university— And I wished so to manage it that the whole credit of it should enure to him as he well deserved that it should, the design and the progress to its execution hitherto being entirely due to him, and I would not attempt to pluck one sprig of laurel from his brow— Mr Lawrence concurred entirely with me on these sentiments, and I proceeded in the preparation of the Letter this afternoon and evening— I read also some of the Letters of Grey.

                "text": "18. IV:30. Sunday.  Still the Northeast storm with copious rain, in frequent showers with intervals of drizzling mist. At the first congregational church in Summer Street. Dr Frothingham this morning preached from Hebrews 11.6. part of the verse— [“]He that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is, and that he is a rewarder”— The whole verse is “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” The Sermon was a Discourse upon Faith; and the omitted parts of the verse before and after the text at once limit and enlarge the field of meditation opened by the text— The affirmation of the verse is that it is impossible without Faith to please God— By leaving out those words the topic of pleasing God, is excluded from the commentary, and the scope of the Sermon is contracted—the closing words of the verse, omitted from the text, limit the idea of God as a rewarder to them that diligently seek him; and their omission enlarges the compass of the discourse, by generalising the idea of God as a rewarder—which includes even retribution in punishment— Dr Frothingham observed that the text at first blush would seem to be a self-evident truism; but that if maturely considered it would be found to contain a lesson of profound wisdom. That prayer to God necessarily implied belief in the existence of God, and of responsibility to him for faithful service— The text implies therefore the belief not only of the existence of God, but of the immortality of the human Soul its responsibility to God and the rewards of a future life— He said there were persons who held the doctrine that the hope of reward was a selfish and mercenary motive, and therefore not virtuous or entitled to reward— That this sentiment was just so far as it commanded and required the exercise of perfect and disinterested virtue, but that the holy spirit in the Scriptures mentioned it in commendation of Moses that he had regard to the recompense of reward and that Christ himself in his enumeration of blessings connects them all with the promise of rewards in Heaven.— The Sermon of the afternoon, was from John 1.1. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”— He said this was the day observed by several Christian denominations of Christians under the name of Trinity Sunday— That this text was the chief pillar of the doctrine to which the day is indebted for its name—that it was an institution of comparatively modern date, twelve centuries having passed over the church before any one had ever thought of celebrating it, as an annual festal day. He then analyzed his text assigning the reasons for rejecting the sense in which it is claimed to sanction the doctrine of the Trinity— I finished my Letter to President Quincy. "

At 9 this morning I went to Mr Abbott Lawrence’s house, and read to him my Letter to President Quincy, about the Observatory which he cordially approved— He told me the Steamer Britannia Captain Hewitt arrived at 5 this morning from Liverpool, whence she departed on Sunday the 4th. of this month; and he gave me Willmer and Smith’s European Times of that date. Mrs Lawrence is at Philadelphia— Their daughter Anna came in while I was with her father— After a call upon Cadmus; upon Libbey the Silversmith to make me a pair of silver Sleeve buttons, and atTappan’s for a Bible to give to my Grandson Henry Brooks Adams, I called upon Mr David Sears, a member of the Committee of the board of Overseers, and read to him also my Letter to President Quincy which he likewise approved— Mr Sears was the contributor of the largest sum to the former subscription for the great refractor, and said he felt some embarrassment in being upon this Committee— I thought it on that very account fortunate that he is upon this Committee, and wish if possible to express my sense of his exertions in this cause by considerations presented to his mind of the extent of the service he is rendering to his country by the devotion of so large a sum to the accomplishment of this undertaking.— My next call was upon Mr Samuel T. Armstrong, who invited me to go with him and visit the missionary establishment, to which I agreed, and he promised to call on me to-morrow morning at 11. O’Clock for that visit. On returning to my Son’s I found President Quincy at the door— He had already called several times this morning to see me, and he now gave me for the consideration of the Committee, the papers which he had read at the conference last Friday; and two additional papers, being the plan of duties to be prescribed to the Perkins professor of Astronomy and Mathematics, and to the Director of the observatory respectively, drawn up separately by Mr Peirce, and Mr Bond— I read to Mr Quincy, my Letter to him which I told him I should send him as soon as I can get it copied— He said he would undertake the work which I recommended, and would execute it to the best of his ability— My Son had a party to dine whose names are in the margin—excepting Mr Brooks my cotemporary all the rest were of a subsequent age— Mr Brooks gave me to read a Letter from Mr Edward Everett his son in Law addresse to him on the third of this month— We had a very pleasant dinner.

Dr George Parkman called and invited me to dine with him next Friday; but I had concluded to go to Quincy Friday— He then asked me for Thursday, but I was engaged to dine that day with judge Davis. Mr Armstrong came at 11. and I went with him to the Missionary house of the orthodox congregational church on Pemberton square. He there introduced me to four gentlemen, clergymen, officers of this association, Messrs. Anderson, Greene, Treat and Henry Hill— I was not aware, that I had ever seen either of them before; but Mr. Anderson told me he had been introduced to me at Washington, and Mr Hill shewed me a Passport which I had given him at London, in October 1815. covered over with endorsements made at sundry towns in France— These gentlemen are all charged with the correspondence of this Society which has 135 Missionaries scattered all over the world in its service— They have a small Museum of Natural history with a collection of curiosities, images, statues and painted figures of idols, chinese, African, Asiatic Indian, from the Sandwich Islands, and from the native tribes of our own Continent— And they have a considerable library of books, of travels and a rich collection of bibles in a multitude of languages, of one of which they made me a present— Mr Armstrong was one of the principal founders, and is now the President of this association— Charles went out to Quincy this morning, and brought me a number of Letters received there for me— Among them one from Revd. Samuel Ripley of Waltham, in answer to mine to him—he informs me that the Adams debating Society, before which I delivered the Lecture upon Society and civilization, no longer exists and I am therefore released from my promise to them of a copy of the lecture, for publication. I despatched my Letter to President Quincy upon the Observatory, and one to my wife, of which I keep no copy, in answer to two from her of 10 and 14 instt.— Dr Frothingham called on me this afternoon, and we had some conversation upon his four discourses, Deism or Christianity— His own opinion of the personal nature of Jesus Christ is not definite. He says expressly “words would fail us fully to tell”—that he was one especially adopted of the Invisible Father &c— One what?— he afterwards says there is nothing in the New Testament requiring the belief of his preexistence, which is equivalent to saying that he was a mere man, but is not a direct assertion that he was so— I went with Dr Frothingham to his house, where Mrs Charles already was, and Charles afterwards came, and we spent a pleasant evening and had a delicious supper— I gave my Grandson Henry Brooks Adams, a plain Philadelphia Stereotype Bible, with the Apocrypha, Brown’s Concordance, and a version of the Psalms, for which I have only waited until he was of an age to read it.

Williams, Henry Gassett and Daniel Weld, renewing a request which they had made to me last Autumn, to have republished in a handsome volume at their expence a collection of all my writings upon the anti-masonic controversy; with an additional preface— Upon their first application I answered that during the then approaching Session of Congress it would be impossible for me to collect and prepare the materials for such a publication, but if my life and health should be continued to me this Spring and Summer, I would cheerfully comply with their desire— Their present Letter is dated the 9th. instt. and was sent to Quincy, whence it was brought to me yesterday by my Son. I called this morning at Charles’s Office 23. Court Street to consult the Directory for the residence of sundry persons whom I wished to visit— I saw there Mr A. C. Spooner, who shares with Charles his Office, though not in business.— After a call on Mr Libbey, where I took my new pair of silver sleeve buttons, and on Cadmus, I stop’d at Dr Frothingham’s, and returned to him the manuscript sermon which he had lent me, on the creation. I also lent him the book which Mr Knox had given me, on the philosophy of the plan of Salvation, and asked him to read it and give me his opinion of it.— He read to me a passage in a volume recently published by Tayler Lewis a Clergyman of New-York, in which commenting upon John 8.57–58. he maintains the same understanding of it as I hold, and that it is an express declaration of his own pre-existence, at least before Abraham— Mr Henry Gassetts house is N. 50 Summer Street— I called there to see him.— The Servant said he was out of town, but was expected home this evening. I asked the servant to tell him that I wished much to see him, and would call again to morrow morning.— At Mr James H. Foster’s I took leave of Mrs Foster and Louisa, and apprized Louisa C. Smith that I should call for her to go out to Quincy; after breakfast Friday morning. Then I visited Judge Peleg Sprague of the United States District Court. 124 Tremont Street; when I first went the judge was out, and Mrs Sprague received me.— As I was going out, I met him at the door, and returned and had some conversation with him— Mrs Charles with her daughter Louisa, her sons Henry and Arthur and the baby went and passed the day at Medford, at her brother Gorham Brooks’s— At 5. I went with Charles and dined with Mr Francis C. Gray, my old pupil and attaché to the Russian mission of 1809. He has been at various periods of his life in public life in the Legislature of the State, but not in Congress. He remains a bachelor, but lives in an elegant and richly furnished house, recently built in Park Street. "

Variable weather— I called to make my farewell visit to Dr George Parkman, and made some enquiries of him concerning the present organization, and regulation of the fire department of this city, so different from that which existed heretofore when I was an inhabitant of Boston— He gave me a summary of the present system, and took me in his gig to the hook and ladder house, at the Northern part of the city, and then to the chamber in the City Hall appropriated to that Department— I saw, without comprehending several fire-engines with their apparatus two of them patented by the name of Hunneman— They gave me at the City Hall, the last 7. annual reports of William Barnicoat, the Chief Engineer to the Mayor and alderman, representing lists and residences of the members of the several fire companies—the condition of the engines and their apparatus; the number of fires in the year, and the Reservoirs of Water for fires throughout the city. Also a pamphlet constitution of the charitable Association of the Boston Fire Department Dr Parkman drop’d me at the entrance of Summer Street— I had while he was going for his gig, visited Mr R. C. Waterston— He was not at home, but I saw Mrs. Waterston with her infant son, 16 days old, and as I came away met miss Sophia Quincy at the door.— In Summer Street, I found Mr Gassett at his house N. 50. and he sent for Mr Odiorne, who came, and we had some conversation concerning their proposal to republish my publications on the Anti-masonic controversy.— I enquired if they could inform me of the present condition of the order of Free Masons, or of the association of Odd Fellows in this State; but they appeared to have no distinct information upon the subject—except that Mr Gassett said he knew there were six Ministers of Unitarian churches who were members of the Association of Odd fellows in this city.— Mr Gassett produced to me printed copies of eight papers written by me and published during the anti-masonic excitement, from 1831 to 1835. and of which he had furnished me with a list— And he had a multitude of other publications on the same subject, which I may want to consult in preparing the preface for the republication— Mr Odiorne reminded me that he was married at Newburyport in 1787 to a daughter of Simon Tufts and that I was present at the wedding— I never for an instant lost the recollection of the fact, but am surprized that often as within the last ten years I have seen this Mr Odiorne, not a suspicion had ever occured to me that this was the man whom I had seen married in 1787. I asked him if his wife was still living. he said no.— I dined with judge John Davis— His brother Isaac P. his two daughters and James Savage were all the party— My son was obliged to go out to Quincy and sent an excuse— After dinner we discussed my answer to the New York historical Society— Mr Savage walked home with me— Rain.

Mr Lunt, and my nephew and namesake called to welcome me home— After dinner Harvey Field came with projects for buying, and selling land: and George French came and introduced to me, Mr Stark one of the Engineers of the Boston and Old-Colony Railroad now in the process of construction, and passes so close to my Easternmost barn, that I shall be under the absolute necessity of having it removed.— Mr Stark came to propose to make on the part of the proprietors of the rail-road arrangements for that operation. I referred him to my Son, who has made all compromises with them hitherto for their encroachments upon my lands— I went up to Charles’s house; and saw the Sun set at 7.— Entering a dense cloud just before touching the horizon. Kirk brought in my trunks from Boston. "

                "text": "24. III.55. Saturday.  Sun rose IV. Set 7.  My way of life is totally changed, and I am here in retirement comparatively seldom interrupted— I ought this day to have resumed the Memoir on the Patent Office, but did not. Though I rose before 4. O’Clock, as it takes me one hour and a quarter to wash, scrub and dress, the Sun had risen about 10 minutes when I reached the Southeast corner of Charles’s house— The Sun has nearly reached the extreme of his northern declination— My grandson John Quincy came out this afternoon in Gillet’s Stage. There are numerous packages of public documents received here during my absence, and which it will give me no small burden to distribute. Four came this day of Document N. 45.— Commercial Systems—a Report from the Secretary of State, founded on Act of 16. August 1842. and I despatched 8 of Document N. 73. Commerce and Trade—a Report from the Secretary of State founded on a Resolution of the House of Representatives of 3. March 1843. These two documents are quite likely to be confounded with each other; and both with the annual document of Commerce and Navigation— I visited my garden, Nursery, and Seminary trees.—My peach trees of all ages are dead or dying— The Philadelphia Maples, flourishing and growing as rapidly as ever, but bearing no fruit— One budded Cherry tree near the centre of the Seminary, bearing fruit and promising— The Louise, Fanny apple-trees in the seminary, and one Pea tree all budded in 1843 doing well—also the stock in the front of my library window with two thrifty buds from a seedling stock sown in 1833. all my seedling English Oaks have perished, but of the shagbark hickories there are a number from 14 years old down to shoots of last summer sown in the autumn of 1843 which have put up stems from top buds and shew signs of vigorous life— Two sown in 1842. fronting the tool-box in the garden, and two sown in 1843 and which first came up last summer in the fenced off patch in the orchard, have thrown up fresh shoots from the ground which with a long summer before them may gain strength to live through the next winter.— I suppose the sowing of nuts and acorns should be in the spring—to bring them up early in the next Spring— In my Library, my attention was drawn, and quartered, by a multitude of attractions— I unpacked two of my trunks, and found my papers sadly crumpled— A heap of state newspapers, stole from me two or three hours, and on looking into my Letter book of 10. Feby 1830.—to 14 Septr 1832.— I find much more to copy and to select upon anti-masonry than I had imagined would be needed— I saw the Sun Set from the porch in front of Charles’s house, and was thoroughly chilled. I found a fire in the dining room and the library necessary the whole day. "

Fahrenheit 32  Sharp frost this morning, and my Chronometer is 12 minutes in advance of the time marked in the Massachusetts Register for the rising and setting of the Sun. I was belated about 5 minutes in reaching my station of observation, and it was winter cold the whole day— Mr Lunt preached this morning, from Matthew 12 43. “When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. 44. Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept and garnished. 45. Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.”— The drift of this discourse was to show that a vicious course of life was as pernicious to the intellectual, as to the moral character of a man.— It was very well written and very forcibly argued with a vehemence of delivery contrasting thoroughly with the cold and tame manner for which Mr Lunt has been censured heretofore.— He is passing from one extreme to the other, and is in danger of becoming as over-energetic, as he was languid and chilling heretofore. His tone is now unnaturally turgid, and his action far more impassioned than his elocution— At an examination of the students in 1802 as a member of the board of overseers, I remember having heard Professor Eliphalet Pearson give out to be parsed the following line— “Faults in the life breed errors in the brain” I knew not, and now not whether it was original, or borrowed from Younger Cowper, but it has remained firm fixed I my Memory from that day to this; and now it would have served as a summary in one line of Mr Lunt’s discourse—the moral of which was admirable, and the illustrations forcible—tempered however with the unavoidable admission of the multitude of sad exceptions, in which the brightest intellect is sullied by the unnatural alliance with a polluted heart— Mr Lunt gave notice that the communion would be administered on the next Lord’s day— Mr Degrand came out from Boston, and dined and spent the day with us— Mr Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from the Wisdom of Solomon 1.6. “For wisdom is a loving Spirit.” He observed that this was one of the Apocryphal books and not admitted by Protestants into the Canon of Scripture—but that in this text the whole sum of the system of Christianity was comprized, and he expatiated upon the blessings of a loving Spirit, as embracing all the duties and all the happiness of man— And he issued a blast against Slavery as among the most execrable of crimes— It is at this moment splitting asunder the Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist churches of this Union.

Coolidge, accepting the invitation to attend and preside at the unitarian collation next Tuesday, and requesting him to inform me how and where, and when I am to meet the association— As I was anxious to receive the information this day, and afraid to trust the mail of Saturday morning, I enclosed this note under a cover to my Son, requesting him to have it delivered to Mr Coolidge in person, with a request that the answer might be sent to me by this morning’s mail.— I sent this Letter and enclosure by the express waggoner who went to Boston Saturday morning— But this Morning Mr. Coolidge and Mr Pray—came out from Boston, to receive my definitive answer to their invitation to attend and preside at the collation. On enquiry of Mr Coolidge I found that he had not received my note of Saturday morning—but I now agreed with them to attend to morrow at one O’Clock at the Hall over the depot of the Worcester Railway, to preside at the Meeting. They proposed to call for me at Mr James H. Foster’s, but I preferred meeting them at the Hall itself.— They gave me a printed order of Exercises; as a guide to my duty in the progress of the day; and promised me a detailed account of the proceedings at the Collation of the last year— They told me, it was usual for the president of the meeting to request his own Minister, to ask the blessing at the table, and I told them I should then make the request to the Revd. Mr Lunt— Fuller went early this morning with the Carriage, and brought out my Son’s wife, with the remainder of his family to his house here on the hill, before dinner. He came out himself in the Stage. After dinner I called at his house, and saw his wife and infant daughter, and Louisa C. I went also to Mr Lunt’s, but he and Mrs Lunt were not returned from Boston where they had gone this morning— I requested their eldest daughter to say to him that I should at the Unitarian Collation to-morrow, at Boston, ask him to say the grace— As I was walking home, I met them, returning from Boston, but did not speak to them.— Mr Beale’s two daughters called here this afternoon to visit Miss Smith, and Mr Beale himself and my Son were here in the evening. The whole day had been so much occupied that I had made little progress in writing out the address which will be expected from me to-morrow— I sat up till one in the morning to bring it to a close— I was determined to say a few words which may provoke severe criticism, and to have them written to escape misrepresentation.

                "text": "28. IV: Wednesday  This is the week which in olden time was called election week. The last Wednesday in May was the day of the annual meeting of the general Court under the Colonial Charter, and under the first Constitution of Massachusetts and the amended Constitution of 1820. It had always drawn a large concourse of people from all parts of the State, especially if the congregational clergy, and the anniversary meetings of all the religious benevolent and scientific Societies had been concentrated upon this week— In October 1831 an Amendment of the Constitution took effect, altering the annual meeting of the Legislature from the last Wednesday in May to the first Wednesday in January, at which time it has thenceforth been held— But the Anniversaries of Societies and the congregation of Ministers still continues as heretofore on the last Wednesday in May. In the process of time, and the changes incidental to human opinions, many of the inhabitants of Boston, and a smaller portion of the ministers of parishes in the country have become warm and zealous Unitarians—but they are bitterly opposed by all the other religious denominations.— In 1842 a number of the Unitarian laymen of the City associated together, and gave a collation, to all the Unitarian ministers, and their wives who visit the city during the election week— This social banquet was repeated in 1843 and 1844— At this meeting of the last year, I had been earnestly invited by the committee of arrangements to attend and preside; but by my absence on duty at Washington had been prevented from accepting the invitation— This year it was very urgently renewed. I accepted it, with pleasure to attend; and with extreme reluctance to preside— A speech was of course required of the President, and to escape embarrassment and for defence against misrepresentation I wrote out an address which Doctor Peirce who sat beside me said occupied precisely 15 minutes— Many other speeches were made, and it was close upon 7 O’Clock, when the doxology was sung and the company separated, after a closing speech from Stephen C Phillips. Mr. Upham of Salem asked me for the manuscript for publication, of my speech which I gave him— I found at Mr James H. Foster’s, the Revd. Mr Kent, and a beautiful girl of 17 who lives at his house, a daughter of my departed friend the late John Bailey.— The Collation was temperate—no beverage but limonade tea and coffee, only the first of which I tasted— I was much fatigued and exhausted, but rose this morning refreshed and saw the Sun rise from the hill, at 4.31. I took a quiet day and wrote to my wife, without copy in answer to hers of the 23d— After dinner and a Siesta, I walked to Mrs Ann Adams’s. I found her in bed suffering severe and unremitting pain, with no prospect or hope of relief. Her daughter Elizabeth remains with her day and night, and her son John Quincy is also there— Returning home I stop’d at Charles’s house, and spent an hour there— He had been to Boston and returned.

The reason that I gave yesterday at the Massachusetts Historical Society for having failed to perform the service, assigned to me some years since of preparing a biographical eulogy of William Tudor junr. to be read before the Society, was that I had not been able to obtain facts, relating to the course of his life indispensable to give an account of it, to do any thing like justice to his character— I mentioned three periods of his life some particulars of which were essential to the developement of his character 1. His travels in Europe when young— 2 His agency in establishing and conducting the North American Review. 3. His Services in the Massachusetts Legislature. I noticed the influence of the Review on the Literature, and Science of the Country, and especially upon the reputation of Boston.— I believed that the name of the Athens of America, had been acquired by that work more than by any other single cause— I knew generally that his activity, zeal, and perseverance had effected more for the establishment and long continuation than the labours of all other men put together— But I had been unable to collect any satisfactory information upon any of these points— A Committee of 3 Members was appointed, with the President to assist me, in the collection of facts upon these several points— I returned to President Quincy the papers which he had sent me—and asked him to send me a copy of the order of the board of Overseers appointing the Committee to report on the Observatory. He seemed to think it unnecessary; but I said I wanted the names of the Committee.— He promised to send them to me— This morning the Sun rose beclouded, and I could not ascertain the time— I consumed not a little time in assorting the papers and opening Letters which were received here before I came out: a work not yet completed— The Newspapers announced the arrival at Boston yesterday of the Schooner Isabella O. Matthew Master from Alexandria— This is the vessel, in which my two chests of Books and papers were shipped— The vessel is advertised to sail again next Tuesday. I gave Kirk the Bill of lading to Kirk to send by Mr French’s daily baggage waggon, and have the chests brought out but they were not— I visited my seedling trees, but take little interest in any of them except the shagbark hickories, of which I have about 30 in various stages of growth— Of the smallest kind several have opened their petals and shot up their stems with five leaved, foliage— In the patch of the orchard behind the garden—there were last summer and autumn 5 seedling shagbark hickories sowed in October 1843.— There are now only 3— Each of them in a different stage of growth, but there are strong marks on all of them that they have been frost-bitten which has stunted their growth— I sawed off from the white mulberry, the white maple, and the white willow, limbs from which I cut off slips which I stuck down near the young hickories to take root— Saw the Sun set at Charles’s at 7:30. Mr Lunt was there. "

Mr Charles Faxon came yesterday as collector of Braintree town highway tax of 1500 dollars 1:84 assessed upon me— I made small progress in assorting my papers and packets received before I came— Among them I opened this day a Letter, dated Belleville Illinois 15. April 1845. and signed Nathl. Niles for Messrs. A. S. Wiley, M. Chambers and John Campbell— It relates to Slavery in the State of Illinois, and claims my immediate attention. But full five weeks have passed away since I should have received it, and now I must sleep over it many times before returning the answer— I received also yesterday a mysterious Letter, dated 27 May 1845. Philadelphia, and signed W D. Lansing, an entire stranger to me, asking whether he can have an interview with me at Boston, by the 10th. of June—and if so to inform him by a line—as he can inform me of some facts of which he presumes I am yet ignorant— These are prominent symptoms of humbug; especially that there is not a hint of the subject upon which these portentous disclosures are to be made— Yet a name without apparent disguise requires an answer— My two chests of books and papers from Washington by the schooner Isabella, Captain O. Matthews were brought out from Boston this day, and I received a Letter from George H. Colton dated New-York 11. May 1845.—without Postmark, stating that he sends 20 plates of my engraved portrait from Marchant’s picture, but no plates came with the Letter— In unpacking my portmanteau trunk, with my files of Letters I found the Lecture on Society and Civilization, which I had promised him for publication— I visited again my seedling trees, but observe no progress in their vegetation— I received a printed circular note of this day’s date signed Henry Rockwell and Oscar R Stone inviting me and my family to visit their Establishment at any time during their stay in this place. With an index hand— Please present this to our door keeper. And in manuscript below— Please retain this; signed Thomas Sproule Treasurer. A Circus announced in the Quincy Aurora of last Thursday.— Positively for one day only— New York Circus or American Olympiad, composed of over 100 artists and steeds with a full column of the like rhodomontade— The performance was under a large tent near the old Town house— I went with my Son his daughter and four Sons, and Mr Lunt’s eldest daughter— The Seats were three rows of benches rising one behind the other circular round the inner border of the tent— The gymnastics were about equal to any thing I had ever seen.— There were from one thousand to twelve hundred Spectators present, and the most perfect order was preserved— They began at half past 7. and finished after ten— The staging was rather slight, but no accident occured. I came home thoroughly chilled— The principal Tumbler was Hiram W Franklin, styled the American Apollo. "

                "text": "1. IV. Sunday.  Sun rose 4 26. Set 7:30. Communion day.  Mr Lunt’s text this morning was from 1. John 4.20. [“]If a man say I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen?” This first epistle of John in five chapters, is devoted entirely to the establishment of the doctrine 1. That God is Light and God is love. 2 That Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and was sent to die as a propitiation for the sins of the whole world 3. That as God loved us, so we ought to love one another 4. That righteousness of life is the only test by which we can prove our love of God, and our obedience to his will— In the verses preceding the text it is said 15. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 16. And we have known, and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.— and the verse immediately succeeding the text is 21. And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.— The 7th. verse of the 5th. chapter of this epistle is claimed by the believers in the doctrine of the Trinity, as proof unanswerable of its Truth— The words are “For there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one” It is strange that such a doctrine as that of the Trinity in unity should have been ever held upon so slender a foundation; in a composition so absolutely figurative— But this verse has been detected as unquestionably an interpolation— In this epistle is also Ch. 1. v. 8. The first introductory sentence of the Episcopalian prayer book, If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. &c— Mr Lunt administered the communion, with less of profound sensibility than usual, and there was less of peculiar aptitude to the occasion in his discourse than I have witnessed heretofore— He announced the accession of two married women to the church as participants at this communion— The preacher of this afternoon was the Revd. Richard Pike of Dorchester; and his text was from Luke 7.50. And he said to the woman, “Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.” He had declared her sins, which he said were many, forgiven— He was dining with a pharisee, whose other guests were astounded at his pretension to forgive sins, and he pronounced it as a reward for her faith— He also declared the sins of the man sick of the palsy to be forgiven and being therefor charged with blasphemy, healed the man of his palsy by a word, and then appealed to the by-standers to say which was easiest—to say thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say arise and walk.— Mr Pike’s discourse was upon Faith— A sensible dissertation, well written in a calm and temperate style, and rather frigidly delivered. He is a young man—not a graduate of Cambridge— The Steamer Britannia, Hewitt departed this morning for Liverpool, and the Steamer Cambria Judkins arrive at 9 this Evening— Left Liverpool 20. May— I saw the Sun rise and set from the hill. "

Monday  Sun set 7:30  When I awoke this morning the Sun was already risen.— John Stocker Freeman, the young man who came to me on the 4th. and 5th. of last November, and for whom I enclosed to Mr Edward Everett Letters to reach Freeman’s Sisters, came again this morning, with a Letter which he gave me to read, from James Mathers a Tailor in London, married to his Sister Mary Ann— It is dated in January last, professes to be very kind, and affectionate, and gives him information about many of his relatives, but says not one word about his maternal grandfather Collins, or about the property left by him. Freeman has written to him twice since he received this Letter but has no answer.— He has some suspicion of Mr Mathers— Thinks it strange that his Sister did not herself write to him— I advised him to write to Mr Mathers once more, and to address to him special enquires concerning Mr Collins and the property left by him— And if he should get no answer, then to write to Coll. Aspinwall our Consul to ascertain in the prerogative Court whether some administration has been effected on Collins’s property— He said he had some thoughts of going this Summer himself to England which he supposed he could do at little or no expence, as he could work his passage— Miss Batchelder was here with a young man from Cambridge— She came in the expectation of finding Mary E. E. Cutts here, having heard that she had arrived with my wife— She is one of Miss Cutts’s Saco Friends, and wrote with a pencil on a card a remembrance to be delivered to her when she arrives.— My nephew John Quincy. 2. dined with us, and Charles only of my sons family. After dinner Dr Edward Jarvis of Dorchester and his brother from Concord New Hampshire came in— The Doctor was anxious to know what had been done in Congress at Washington with the Memorials of the American statistical association and the Massachusetts Medical Society concerning the errors in the returns of the sixth census of 1840.— I told him how the memorials had been treated— At the first Session of the last Congress referred to a select Committee which—on the last day of the Session reported that they had not had time to investigating the subject— At the second Session referred to a select committee of which I was chairman, but of which I was never to obtain a quorum— A false and prevaricating report from John C. Calhoun Secretary of State upon an impudent statement by the knave who cheated Congress and the Nation into a double publication of the compendium, filching from Blair, and Rives a bargain of 3000 dollars for himself— I saw the Sun set from the porch of Charles’s house— Met there Mrs Lunt and her two daughters. Charles came home with me, for an Evening hour. "

O’Clock this morning my Son took his eldest daughter Louisa Catherine to Boston, and thence to Lenox, where she passed the last winter at the boarding school of Mrs Charles Sedgwick, and now returns after a vacation of six weeks.— She will be if she lives, 14 years old on the 13th. of next August, and is a very promising child. I received at Washington from the late Commissioner of Patents Henry L. Ellsworth ten small parcels of seeds—Corn, Rye, 2. Beans 2. Beet, connecticut squash, Bocharia Melon 2 and Essex Spring wheat, all which I propose to have sown in my garden by way of experiment besides the bag of beans about two quarts which I purchased for trial— I copied the directions from the Patent Office, on all these samples to watch the progress of their growth— Harvey Field came, and passed a full hour in coaxing me to take off of his hands a purchase of 26 acres of land adjoining the house of the late Anthony W. Baxter— He offers them at 50 dollars an acre, and will give 100 dollars for the trees standing. I have no doubt that these lands will rise in value beyond the interest of the money, but refrain from speculation in Quincy lands, to avoid as much as possible all new involvement at my time of life— Mr William Ellis of Dedham was here this afternoon, and as usual enquiring about the pension claims of William Barron; of which I could as usual give him no satisfactory information for want of my Washington files of papers, and especially of the Journal of the House of Representatives of the last Session— He spoke much of Captain Samuel Tucker commander of the Boston Frigate, in which on the 11th. of February 1778. I embarked from Mount Wollaston beach, accompanying my father to France.— Sixty-seven years have passed away since that day, which dwells upon my Memory as if it were but yesterday. I received further a Letter from Mr Henry Gassett with a large package of publications for and against the Independent Odd fellows a bastard slip from the tree of Free-Masonry, and a voluminous Report made in the year 1835 to the British Parliament, and then printed by order of the House of Commons, on the Orange Institutions in Great Britain and the Colonies— These papers are indispensable for me to prepare the preface for the republication of my anti-masonic papers.— When I shall be able to take them up I can scarcely foresee. The weather was at oppressive Summer heat, and I exchanged for a Summer waistcoat, the velvet one lined with flannel. I spent the Evening on the hill with Mrs Charles— And I received a Letter dated 19. May 1845. from George Joy of Pentonville—London. "

In the heat of the day yesterday, I exchanged my velvet waistcoat lined with flannel, for a cotton summer vest, and this morning I arose with a severe lumbago, which continued through the day, and confined me chiefly to the house; though the weather was fair and warm with a brisk breeze— I had no spirit for labour, and coasted in idleness the precious time— By some constraint upon myself I was enabled to get through with the journal of yesterday, and to copy a list of names of persons to whom I am to send public documents— I visited my seedling plants, and made fruitless efforts to observe for some useful purpose the process of vegetation— Last October Kirk transplanted for me from the Nursery to the Seminary a seedling shagbark walnut tree, about nine years old 7. feet 4 inches high. The stem 3 inches in circumference near the ground— Straight 3 feet 3 inches before branching out— Then putting out thirteen branches of different growth to the top of the stem each with a germinating bud at the end of the branch, and one on the top of the stem, of different sizes oviform and the largest nearly of the size of a hen’s egg.— When I first came home on the 3d. of May I found this tree with all the buds full and swollen, but not one of them open— So they remained four weeks till the last of May, and I feared that the tree by transplantation had lost its vegetative power.— Since then all the buds have been slowly opening and unfolding themselves, a process not yet completed. The two sets of external scales or petals separate and peel back, like the opening of a rose bud and disclose from 3 to 7 slender stalks each with 3 or 5 leaflets rolled round itself, which when disengaged from its prison bounds expands into the broad leaf of the tree— I see the maternal care of nature in keeping these nascent leaves sheltered from the frosts of May, and I see its necessity manifested in the perished stem of one second years seedling, which came up prematurely, and in the scorched leaves and strangled vegetation of several others— Michaux supposes that the peeling off of the external scales of the shagbark walnut bulb, is the origin of the peculiarity of the tree in shedding its bark. I have other seedlings, apples, pears, peaches coming up, but have no confidence in their continued growth and heed them very little— Some of the budded trees are doing well— All the peach trees are perishing, and from some unknown cause all the button wood trees throughout the country are slowly dying— My Grandson John Quincy left us this day for his visit to Mr and Mrs Grinnell at New-Bedford; and his father returned from his journey to Lenox, where he has again placed his daughter Louisa Catherine in the charge of Mrs Charles Sedgwick "

I have been so little accustomed to be totally disabled by sickness from the daily labour of my life, writing reading or thinking, that I repine at being taken away from them for a single day— I strive also to resist, and with no small difficulty succeeded this day in writing the journal of yesterday— But it was the labour of the day— I could accomplish nothing more. Mrs Gardner of Dorchester a daughter of the late Doctor Holbrook with Miss Clark a sister of Mrs Jeremiah Boies of Milton were here to visit Miss Smith—but I was on my bed and did not see them. In order not to lose entirely the time of my disability to write upon the subjects to which I was pledged I looked into some of the documents furnished me by Mr Henry Gassett, to assist me in the preparation of a preface to the republication of my antimasonic Letters— During the heated controversy from 1827 to 1835 concerning the order and Institution of Free-Masonry, very little notice was taken of any other secret Society— The result of that contest in this Commonwealth was a Law prohibiting on severe penalties, the administration of secret Oaths— There was no express abolition of the order of Free-Masons. But as an affiliated Society they were broken up, and most of the lodges throughout the State voluntarily dissolved themselves.— But they retained their organization, continued to hold in Boston their secret meetings, and occasionally to admit new members to their sublime-ridiculous rites and ceremonies.— Within the last two or three years they have been again creeping out of their crevices and hiding places, and courting public notice and applause. But besides the order of Masons, a new Order has presented itself under the burlesque appellation of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.— They have adopted most of the mummeries, some of the bombastic titles, and some of the foolish trivial obligations of the Free-Masons— Of this order as a secret Society I knew nothing, nor of their connection with Free-Masonry, till, I was applied to for the republication of my Anti-masonry; but Mr Gassett has furnished me with several pamphlets and numerous papers relating to it— Among the pamphlets are—The Symbol and Odd fellows Magazine May 1845—Revd. E. H. Chapin Editor.— 2. Constitution and By-laws and Rules of Suffolk Lodge, number 8. of the Independent Order of Odd fellows, instituted Feby 24 1842.— 3. Odd fellowship exposed by Past Grand Charles Dennison—1843. and 4. Three Lectures on Odd Fellowship by Revd Nathaniel Colver, with an Essay on its practical influence in regard to church discipline.— I rode this afternoon, in the barouche, with Charles’s wife and Arthur to Braintree, and back by the new road through the quarries.

                "text": "6. IV. Friday.  After a painful and almost sleepless night I flattered myself this morning and through the day that my complaint was subsiding— It was only because the atmosphere was cool, almost cold, the morning cloudy and with a delusive promise of rain— My morning exercise became all but impracticable by the loss of the command of my own limbs; the observation of the rising and setting Sun, disconcerted, all my instinctive habits dislocated, and my order of time subverted, the day serves me for little more than to bemoan my own condition.— Henry Hardwick was here to urge again his oft repeated proposition to purchase a strip of my land adjoining his and near his house to give him the command of a passage way across which he had erected bars— He complained that Harvey Field had plucked up his posts and scattered his rails and thrown them over the wall. Harvey denies his right to bar the passageway. I referred him to my Son— I resumed my examination of the papers furnished me by Mr Gassett, relating to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows— The Symbol and Odd Fellows Magazine of May 1845—is N. 5 of Vol. 4 of a Monthly Magazine, devoted to this order and its purposes.— It is a secret affiliated Society, apparently existing in every part of the civilized world with most of the properties and pretensions of Free-Masonry— It was founded in Massachusetts on the 26th. of March 1820. by three Englishmen the first of whom James B. Barnes, who came from England in 1817 and had been a member and Noble Grand of the order there.— Numerous lodges followed, until the explosion of 1832. when this order was prostrated together with that of Free-masonry— In June (22) 1841. Massachusetts Lodge N. 1. was reorganized, and there are now under the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts 68 subordinate Lodges and upwards of 6000 members. In Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island there are Grand Lodges Encampments, and subordinate Lodges of the same Institution, and on the 19th. of this Month, they are to meet in all the numbers that they can muster, and have a grand celebration at Boston, consisting of an Oration, procession in regalia, and dinner— The Oration is to be delivered by James L. Ridgely of Baltimore— The Motto of the Order is Friendship Love and Truth— Its avowed objects mutual aid and relief in distress. There are six Ministers of Unitarian churches in Boston, members of the order— I rode round the Milton square this afternoon, with Mrs Charles and Arthur; as we were returning we met Dr George Parkman with his wife and daughter returning to Boston, from a visit to our house at Quincy— We stop’d and spoke He invited me to dine with him at Boston next Wednesday; which invitation I accepted, if the state of my health will admit.

Mrs Lucy Greenleaf, wife of John Greenleaf daughter of Richard and Mary Cranch my mothers elder sister was born at Salem in September 1767 two months after I was born at Braintree— She is of course in her 78th. year— Her husband over 80. is blind, and deaf and paralytic, and for several years they have both been on the verge of the grave— She has had several paralytic shocks; and one at the beginning of this week, from which her family have been hourly expecting her decease— Mrs Ann Adams, widow of my brother Thomas is lingering on her death bed with the sequel to a cancer in the breast for which in October 1840 she submitted to an operation, by Dr John C. Warren— I am now the third invalid of the family abiding the ravages of time, the decays of age and the dispensations of a wise, and beneficent Providence.— My nephew John Quincy Adams, 2 passed Midshipman in the Navy was here this morning, and Mr James H. Foster with his daughters Louisa and Mary towards evening My Son and his wife went to Boston, and brought back their Son John Quincy 3. returned from his visit of 3 days to Mr and Mrs. Grinnell at New-Bedford— I wrote my journal, and a Letter to my wife—despatched sundry packets of public documents, and read a report of a special Committee, to the House of Representatives of this State, made on the 12th. of March last, by William Schouler, on sundry petitions from operatives in the manufactures of Lowell, Fall River and Andover, relating to the hours of labour— The petitions are for what is called the ten hour system— Their actual labour is about 12.— Their wages are proportioned to the time of their labour— They want a law to reduce their hours of labour without reducing their wages.— They make no case, and the report of the Committee is against them— There are petitions to Congress for this same ten hour system—very plausible and popular but delusive. There is in this report much valuable information concerning the condition of these cotton and woollen manufactures, which like all useful studies kindle a thirst for more— I read also part of the correspondence of Mr Gassett with the six Unitarian Ministers of Boston, members of the Independent order of Odd fellows—Samuel K. Lothrop, Frederick D. Huntington, Chandler Robbins, F. T. Gray, J. I. T. Coolidge and John T. Sargent— Mr Huntington only answers Mr Gassett’s Letters— He assigns as his reasons for becoming a member of the order of Odd fellows, the desire of exercising religious influences over the minds of persons to whom he could not otherwise have the means of access. The Odd Fellows like the Freemasons admit clergymen gratuitously— "

A frowning thunder cloud came up this morning before Sunrise, with a promise of copious rain; but it passed off with a small sprinkling, three or four faint flashes of lightning and the rumbling of distant thunder, and the sky cleared up for an intensely warm and dry day— Mr Lunt preached at home, all day— His morning text was from John 4.48. [“]Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.” This is the same chapter in which is told the revelation by Jesus of himself as the Messiah, to the woman of Samaria, at Jacob’s Well.— He was going from Judea through Samaria to Galilee, because he knew that the pharisees heard that he made and baptized more disciples than John— He was travelling on foot with his disciples which of them we are not told, and reached the well, at Sychar, weary, exhausted and thirsty, and was sitting on the well, when the woman came up to draw water— The disciples had gone away to the city to buy meat— He was alone with the woman, and asked her to give him to drink.— She asks him, how he, a Jew, dares ask her, a Samaritan woman, to give him drink— How she knew that Jesus was a Jew, is not told, but a main object of his mission was to break down that deadly barrier of hatred between the people of the two kingdoms, into which the children of Israel had divided themselves— He was to restore harmony between them and bring them all back to one fold— He tells her of this purpose, and that he is the Messiah.— He makes an occasion to shew that he knows her whole history—that she has had five husband, and is living with a man not her husband—whereupon she concludes him to be a prophet and announces him to the city as the Messiah— Thus introduced he discourses to the Samaritans in the city, and in the course of two days, converts many Samaritans to the faith, by his word— He thence passes into Galilee where he performs the miracle of healing the nobleman’s son, distant a day’s journey from him, rather to relieve the nobleman’s distress for his Son, than to display the manifestation of his miraculous power—for in this case, the witnesses of the cure were not witnesses of the healing word— Mr Lunt’s afternoon text was from 1. Thessalonians 5.23. “And the very God of Peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” From this text Mr Lunt deduced his favourite doctrine that for the whole sanctification of the Christian, his religion must be under the harmonious guidance of reason, feeling and will—the whole spirit soul and body— After the service, I rode with Louisa C. Smith, and Mrs Charles and visited Mr and Mrs John Greenleaf, and Mrs. Ann Adams, all close upon the last gasp of life— A melancholy sight and a warning voice. "

H Brisbane M.D. Delivered by request of the family of the deceased and of the Liberty party of Hamilton County, Ohio— Morris was a democrat of the ranket essence— He was the only member of the U.S. Senate who dared to meet and resist the Slave domination of the South, and he was supplanted in his office, by the more supple democrat Benjamin Tappan— My Son took his eldest son John Quincy this morning into Boston to attend the Latin School—the term of which this day recommences after a vacation of a fortnight— I rode this afternoon, with Miss Smith, Mrs Charles, Miss Sampson and Arthur Left Miss Sampson at Mrs Ann Adams’s—went to Braintree, and took her up as we returned.— Visit with Miss Smith and Mrs Charles to Mr and Mrs Thomas Greenleaf— Call of Miss Smith at Mr William Appleton’s— Charles in the evening here.

This last I recognized this morning, and not with equal certainty Capella; but not the Comet The dawn had commenced, and I had no glass.— The appearance of this Comet just at this time, and the simultaneous and immediate notice of it at the two observatories of Washington and of Cambridge, have given me a pleasure all my own; for no other person will understand or sympathise with it— This was a blazing hot and scorching day.— My Sciatica, was slowly and gradually subsiding, and I was thinking much of the day where I should look for that poetical tour de force, the French Rondeau— Pour te guérir de cette Sciatique— Time wasted— But in my wanderings round my library, I pitched upon a beautifully printed duodecimo volume of upwards of 900 pages; two hundred years old, within 3.—on handsome paper, a fine type, an Elzevier Edition, bound in smooth and unsullied parchment— It was Cl. Salmasius de Annis climactericis et antiqua astrologia Diatribae— Lugd. Batavor. Ex Officina Elziviriorum 1648.— It is dedicated Leydae Idibus Novembribus 1647.— Gaspari Cogneto, Domino de la Thuilerie, Baroni de Coursons, royal counsellor and Minister of Louis 14 to the States General of the United Netherlands— Of this man I can find no other trace, But Salmasius tells him in the dedication that this work was composed at his request, upon a conversation with him a year before at the Hague— There is a preface to the reader of 98. pages, a synopsis of the work of 20 pages and 844 pages of the work itself, all in elegant Latin— I translate a passage from the second page of the preface, thus “There is nothing in which men, by no means fools indulge and flatter themselves more licentiously than in the divination of futurity, and hence it is that they flock with such eagerness to every mountebank who professes the art; and lavish all sorts of favour on those who feed them with its delusive promises— And as if they were or knew something more than is given to mortals to know, they call them divines, because the foreknowledge of future events is a part of divinity— This faculty belongs to God alone, and can be possessed by no mortal unless bestowed by him— Which is so intensely desired by multitudes ever spurred by curiosity that it is no wonder if many pretend to a perfect knowledge of that of which they are entirely ignorant.[”] (The close to-morrow—)— I rode this afternoon, with Mrs. Charles and Arthur to Braintree. We left Miss Smith and took her up at Dr. Woodwards. "

My Sciatica continues gradually to subside without external application or internal medicine— It leaves me to the command of my own time, but not to the controul of my own indolence. The rain of yesterday gave an impulse to vegetation, which I was stimulated to observe but with the discouragement of reflecting that all my observations upon vegetation, which for the last 20 years I have perseveringly pursued, are barren.— Of the seed from the Patent Office, sown by Kirk 3. June the prolific white bush bean, are up with unfolded leaves—and the seed leaves of both Bokhara Melons are out of the ground— The vegetation of the Shagbark walnut, in its early stages deserves profound study and the inventive faculty— Two shoots of the second year which came up since 23d. May, have perished by drought, frost or Sun— 3. are struggling for life by the preservation of the central stem—6 of the 3d. and 4th. year are uncertain. Their first developement frost bitten. A new central shoot beginning to be seen. The tree 8 or 9 years old transplanted last October from the Nursery to the Seminary, has opened 14 large buds—10 at the ends of the branches, and 1. at the top of the stem. Each opened bud throws up from 4 to 7. stalks each with 3 or 5 leafets now in the process of developement— Obviously checked, and retarded by the drought. My other seedlings and buds scarcely deserve a passing notice— My peach trees are a desolation— One white hart cherry bud, has nearly overgrown the mazzard stock and bears a half gallon of sickly looking cherries. The Bartlett Pear buds grow so as to threaten to break down the Stock— My Oaks and Maples thrive to hearts content.— Passed Midshipman John Quincy Adams 2 called this morning, still waiting orders during his mothers distressing illness— I besieged him with a multitude of enquiries concerning life upon the Ocean in our public ships— A line of Battle ship, a Frigate, a Sloop of War, and a Steamer is a Republic in miniature, and each of them subject to a government as complicated as that of the United States of America as the organization of a Moschito is more complicated than that of a man. After dinner I rode with Louisa Smith, Mrs Charles, and Elizabeth C. Adams whom we took up at her mothers, to Weymouth, and visited at Mrs Mercy Tufts’s— We saw her two maiden daughters Mercy and Susan, and a grown up daughter of Professor Charles Brooks— Mrs Tufts herself is upwards of 80 years of age, unable to leave her chamber, and altogether disabled in body and mind— I went up into her chamber, she knew me and was overjoyed to see me. She talked without ceasing, and insisted on giving me a handkerchief with which she said my face was wiped when I was baptised— Evening visit with Charles to Mr. Beale— Mr Emmons’s house mixed. "

There was thunder, lightning and rain in the night but I heard nothing of it— When I rose it was over, but the highway was yet wet— After breakfast it cleared away and the day and evening were beautiful— My Grandson Arthur 4 years old theof next month amused me all the morning with his natural vivacity and inquisitiveness— I received a copy of Mr George Lunt’s address to the Massachusetts horticultural Society which I heard him deliver on the 15th. of last month— Also a veto message from Governor Roger S. Baldwin of Connecticut to the Legislature, upon an act requiring of an incorporated bridge company to increase the draw from 33 to 50 feet to accommodate the passage of steam vessels not existing or known at the time when the bridge was incorporated— Also an Address to the Essex Agricultural Society 25. Septr. 1844. by John W. Proctor from the author— A dissertation on the Chinese language by Dr S.

Washington, published in Bennett’s New-York Herald of the 10th. instt— And the first number of the True American a weekly newspaper, undertaken to be published by Cassius M. Clay, at Lexington, Kentucky—[“]devoted to universal Liberty, gradual emancipation in Kentucky; Literature; Agriculture; Elevation of Labor, Morally and Politically; Commercial Intelligence &c &c.” I fear a premature undertaking; which will very soon be broken down by popular violence. Its date is of the 3d. of June—and I have a melancholy foreboding of its end— Andrews is the name of the man who supplies us with fresh fish, and who was here this morning— The Revd. Mr Curtis of Pittsfield New-Hampshire was here this afternoon with his wife— He is a native of Randolph born when it was a part of the town of Braintree; but not old enough to remember when it was set off and incorporated as a separate town— He left it in 1807. and went to Dartmouth College— He has never since returned to reside there, but has now been on a visit to his relatives and friends, and being on his return home called to see me, merely to gratify his curiosity, for which I returned my thanks.— In visiting my seedling plants I found one more shoot from a nut which had come up last Summer, in the Orchard patch adjoining the garden— This shoot is the fourth in that enclosure— There is yet one more to come up. I found also several other traces of fresh vegetation— "

James 1845. and on the blank leaf preceding the title page, written “The author requests Mr Adam’s opinion of this book as a school book.” A request to be taken ad referendum— I received also a Letter from my Granddaughter Louisa Catherine Adams at Lenox. At 11. O’Clock, I left my house with my Son. A heavy rain commenced as we set out—and poured till we reached his office in Boston and an hour longer. I stop’d a few minutes at Raymond’s shop 229. Washington Street, for a watch key. He had found the one that I had left there and which he had forgotten to return with the watch; but its pipe was split, and I could not wait to take another— I left the watch with him again— At 2. Fuller came with the Carriage, and we rode to Mr Peter C. Brooks’s at Medford, and dined with the Trustees of the agricultural Society—and as in the margin— Mr Mason was one of the persons who dined with General Andrew Jackson at my house on the 4th. of March 1819. at Washington, which he this day told my Son, he perfectly recollected, and that he was seated next to Jackson at the table— The weather was so unfavourable that I had no opportunity for visiting Mr Brooks’s garden. At about 6. O’Clock we left his house, and came through Boston without stopping and reached home at Quincy just after 8— This is by the Massachusetts Register the first day of the summer Solstice, which continues the Sun rising at 4.27. and setting at 7.33. till the 28th. This reckoning is from the appearance and disappearance of the centre of the Sun’s disk. The Calendar of the American Almanac reckons from the appearance of the first to the disappearance of the last ray of the Sun’s disk, and makes allowances for refraction and parallax. It reduces the solstice to four days, from this to the 17th. inclusive. Fixing Sun rise at 4.22 and Sunset at 7.38. Making the longest days of 15 hours and 16 minutes—of course ten minutes longer than that of the Massachusetts Register— The first volumes of the American Almanac gave the rising and setting of the Sun as is yet done in the Massachusetts Register. The corrections for refraction and parallax were introduced in 1835, and announced in the preliminary observations on the astronomical department in the almanac of 1836. "

I saw the Sun rise in cloudless splendour at the extreme point of his Northern declination—the same that I have observed many times before— Mr Lunt’s morning text was from Colossians 1.16. “For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or power; all things were created by him, and for him. 17. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.” Mr Lunt does not consider this text as affirming the divinity of Jesus Christ Neither does Doctor Frothingham— Neither can I— But I wish I could satisfy my own mind of any possible construction of those words, and of those of the first chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, to refute those whose faith in the godhead of Christ is pinned upon them.— Mr Lunt supposed that all material substances, the globe of earth itself might by the power of God be subtilized into invisible spirit, and yet retain its properties as an earthly globe— Mr Lunt understands this creation of all things by Christ as spoken only of the system of christianity. I found yesterday the 6th. volume of Adam Clark’s Bible and commentary, and turning to this passage met a long and elaborate argument to prove from the 16th. and 17th verses of this chapter the godhead of Jesus— I cannot believe it.— The simple truth is that to my unassisted reason these passages of St. Paul’s writings are inconsistent with themselves, absurd and impossible—blending in confusion inextricable a three fold character of Christ—1. as almighty God—2. as the only begotten Son of God, and 3. As mortal man, without sin— As God he is eternal— As the Son of God he is begotten— As man he is born but not like other men—his conception, his birth, his life, his death are all miraculous— His resurrection is of the body— He eats bread, and vanishes from sight, after Thomas the doubter has thrust his finger into the wound in his side— Incredulus Odi— It is not true— It is hateful— But how shall I contradict Saint Paul? I must wait for an explanation intelligible to my frail and feeble reason, and suspend my faith Mr Lunt’s afternoon text was from Genesis 6.4. [“]There were giants in the earth in those days”—part of a verse, the whole of which is unintelligible, and marvellous— Mr Lunt’s inference from it, how drawn I did not very clearly discern, was the Eternity of God— After the service I rode with Louisa C. Smith and Mrs Charles to Mr John Greenleaf’s. We found there a large family of Mrs Lucy and Mrs Mary Dawes—with Richard C. Greenleaf and his wife and infant boy. Mrs Greenleaf had expressed a wish to see me once more, but was now too feeble to see me. We called also at Mrs Ann Adams’s, but did not see her, as she was suffering extreme pain; from which she has night or day no relief but from opiates.— Charles spent the Evening with us. "

Charles took his Son John Quincy to Boston to school— A man named Holbrook from the town of Knox, in Waldo County, Maine came and introduced himself to me before breakfast— He said that having come from home thus far, he thought he would not go back without seeing old John Quincy Adams, for that was the name I went by, down in Maine— I asked him if he had come here upon any business— He said no— Mr Abercrombie came with a subscription paper, to recruit the library of the Sunday School. My namesake nephew was here before dinner, and Mr and Mrs Achilles of Rochester New-York who came on a visit of mere curiosity— I dined with Miss Smith at my Son’s house on the hill, and after dinner we saw the Steamer, Cambria go down the harbour, on her voyage to Halifax and Liverpool— This afternoon I had a visit from Benjamin Allen, a man who lived with my father in the last years of his life, and brother of Thomas Allen, who lived one winter with me at Washington, and was afterwards in the service of the late Governor Eustis— They both went and settled in the State of Maine though at a distance of 100 miles of each other— Both have been successful in acquiring property and a comfortable subsistence— E. Price Greenleaf came and returned three volumes of the French Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres which he had borrowed, and he walked with me round my Nursery, Garden and seminary to inspect my seedling and budded trees.— He gave me some advice for the management of them, but little encouragement for the future growth of the transplanted shagbark walnut in which the remnant of interest that I feel for the cultivation of fruit trees, from the seed is concentrated. Evening ride with Louisa C. Smith, Mrs Charles and Arthur to Mount Wollaston— In the course of my desultory and idle reading I chanced to alight upon the first volume of Milton’s prose writings—Symmons’s Edition—beginning with familiar epistles translated from the Latin, by Robert Fellowes, at Oxford.— There are only 31. of them. The first to his Tutor Thomas Jure, dated London—March 26. 1625— The last to Peter Heimbach, Counsellor to the Elector of Brandenburgh—dated London August 15. 1666— An interval of more than forty-years—from the beginning of the reign of Charles the first, to the 6th. year after the restoration of Charles the second— There are good thoughts in these Letters, but no symptom to me of the transcendent genius of John Milton— His favourite historian was Sallust—and Tacitus as his imitator.

Immediately after I rose this morning I was suddenly seized with a return of the Sciatica, which I flattered myself had passed away— This attack was more severe than the former one; kept me in severe pain the whole day—disabled me for writing so that it was with the utmost difficulty that I got through the record of the day before. I was compelled to resort to the girdle of cotton matting which had been made for me, but which I had dispensed with wearing hitherto.— Just before I rose there had been thunder and lightening and a heavy shower of rain which still continued— The sky then cleared off and a cold brisk breeze from the Northwest blew, and searched my reins for the remainder of the day— Yet I strolled about my nursery, garden and seminary to observe the progress of vegetation on my seedling trees. In the centre of the Seminary is a white-hart cherry, budded upon a mazzard stock— It has been ten years there, and the bud has not yet entirely overgrown the stock— It bore last year about half a dozen cherries, and has now upon it perhaps fifty— In the course of half an hour this morning I saw a Robin, a Catbird, and a blue-bird successively fly up to the tree, near the top, and regale themselves upon the reddening and ripening fruit— They will leave none to be gathered; but they want the cherries more than I. Half way between that tree and my window is the transplanted shagbark, the buds of which have been opening nosegays of spreading cinque-foil leaves upon lengthening stalks— I saw by the morning newspapers that the schooner Columbia Captain Knapp arrived yesterday from Alexandria, with a Trunk ship’d by my wife, at Georgetown.— I rode this afternoon with Louisa C. Smith, Mrs Charles and Arthur to Mr John Greenleaf’s where we were informed that Mrs Greenleaf was somewhat revived— Then to Mrs Ann Adams, who is still in unmitigated suffering. Here Miss Smith alighted and Elizabeth C. Adams took her place in the barouche; we rode to Germantown; then returned to Mrs. Adams’s left Elizabeth and took up Miss Smith— We left Mrs Charles at Wyman Abercrombie’s shop, came home and sent back the barouche for her— After tea, I walked home with Arthur; and his father came and spent the evening with me— I read this day in the Charleston Mercury of 9. 10 and 11. June three Letters from James H. Hammond an Ex-Governor of South-Carolina, to Thomas Clarkson, in defence and vindication of Slavery, avowed, and of African Slave-trade, disavowed— I read also two Letters from President Wayland, to the Revd Dr Richard Fuller arguing syllogistically that Slavery is a Sin.

I was obliged to suspend my washing and horse-hair friction almost entirely, but had an easier day than yesterday. I received a Letter from my wife dated last Sunday, in which she advises me that she proposes to leave Washington this day, and to come from New-York by the Long Island Rail-road next Saturday. I sent Fuller to Boston, and he brought out the trunk which had arrived from Washington in the Schooner Columbia— Afternoon visits from Miss Anna Thaxter and Mr and Mrs Luther Lincoln of Hingham. I visited my seedlings, and among the rest the beans, a bag of which I brought with me from Washington. I neglected to measure the exact quantity of them before they were sown. They are up very thick in five rows in a lot fenced off in the pasture below the orchard.— Towards Sunset I walked up the hill, where I found Mrs Frothingham, with her eldest son Thomas and her two daughters just departing to return to Boston, from a visit to Mrs. Charles— My Son spent the Evening with me— My reading this day was desultory, and trashy.— I revised my Lecture upon Society and civilization, and folded up and directed it to H. G. Colton 118 Nassau Street New-York. I read two more Letters from President Wayland to Dr Fuller on the Sin of Slavery, and a joint Letter to Orestes A. Brownson, and the Editor of the North-American Review from R. Hildreth, author of a “Theory of Morals.” Brownson and Bowen are editors of a Quarterly and the North American review, both of whom in their respective journals detected and exposed Hildreth’s Theory of Morals as a pantheistic infidel work; and he retorts upon them their charges— He reasons upon Religion much as Hammond the Slavemonger reasons upon human rights. A few weeks since Reuben M. Whitney—died at Washington of a Cancer in the throat—and this day the Newspapers from Boston, announce the death of Andrew Jackson, at his Hermitage in Tennessee on Sunday the 8th. of this month at 6 O’Clock in the Evening, of old age— They were two of the bitterest enemies I have had to encounter in this life— Whitney because I exposed him as a villain— Jackson because I saved him from disgrace, and infamy.— Whitney was a swindler of uncommon talents, and pandered to John Tyler’s hatred of me, till he gave him an office from which the Senate ejected him. Jackson was a hero, a murderer, an adulterer, and a profoundly pious presbyterian, who in the last days of his life belied and slandered me before the world, and died in full confidence that his sins were pardoned by the atoning blood of the Saviour— Whitney as a common place knave will be forgotten now he is dead, but the welkin rings with tolling bells, and minute guns, and funeral eulogies, and vociferous lamentations for the departed hero and Saint, worthy of being canonized by the side of George of Cappadocia.

I am flattered with the hope of relief from my troublesome companion Lumbago, Sciatica, or Hip gout, but dare not yet rely upon the promise, and from all profitable employment am yet in a state of suspended animation— My namesake grandson came home yesterday, and has this day a holiday, for the great festival pageant of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The resurrection of Freemasonry, strip’d of some of its abominations, and professing to be devoted to Friendship, Love, and Truth.— An Oration in Faneuil Hall by James L Ridgley of Baltimore— Coll. Newell A. Thompson presiding—preceded by an Anthem.— Then a prayer by the Revd. Mr Norris, Editor of the Olive Branch, gave a history of the position, rise and progress of the Order— Then followed a procession of 5500 or 7500 odd fellows, swarming from all the lodges of the Land, formed on Boston Common and strolling round all the Streets to show themselves in the regalia, that is, antic and fantastic dresses, and gewgaws of the order, in the heat of a midsummer Sun, for upwards of three hours— The Chief Marshal of this procession was Albert Guild who with thirty aids, escorted on horseback in elegant apparel, the rank and file clad in tasteful regalia, with emblems and rich gorgeous banners— A dinner of 7000 feeders under a tent on the common succeeded, at which the Revd. T. F. Norris presided— The blessing was asked by the Revd. Mr Leigh, Chaplain of the Grand Lodge.— Mr William Hilliard was Toast master— Among the Speakers were the Revd. Mr Norris, Coll. Thompson, Mr Ridgley the Orator—the Revd. E. H. Chapin, Mr Kennedy of New-York, Mr Wildey of Baltimore, Mr G. M. Wood of Rhode-Island, Mr Devotion of Connecticut and Mr Case of South Carolina— The revival day was further celebrated in the evening, by a Levee, supper and Ball at Faneuil Hall in which the Ladies participated, and where further addresses were delivered by the Revd. E. H. Chapin, Coll. J. D. Kinsman of Portland, and others— I record all these names of persons not one of whom is known to me, with a view to ascertain more fully the origin, and purpose, and object of this ostentatious, and bombastic display of Free-Masonry by transmigration— Is a magnet of partial association, an essential property of Democracy? and does the multitude of partial associations, by mutual counteraction, bring all back to the level of democracy? probandum est— I had an after dinner visit from Mr Asher Tyler an excellent whig member of the last Congress from the State of New-York, with a Mr Sacket from Seneca County in that State— I rode with Miss Smith, Mrs Charles, and Arthur, first to Mrs Ann Adams, and then by the road to Quincy point turning at the Methodist Meeting house, and round by Dr Storrs’s, from Braintree down by Penn’s hill— Saw the Sunset and the full Moon rise precisely at the extreme Northern declination of the Sun, and Southern of the Moon. The sinking disk of the Sun illuminated the portrait of my great grandfather John Quincy painted when he was two years old— My Son closed the evening with me, at my house— I changed my bed chamber the night before last.

                "text": "20. IV. Friday  Morning visit from Mr Lunt with whom I had a long conversation upon this triumphal celebration of the revival of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows— I told him that Mr Henry Gassett and three other Gentlemen had applied to me by personal interview last Fall requesting my consent to the publication at their expence of a new pamphlet edition of all my writings relating to the Anti-masonic controversy; these gentlemen had been ardent antimasons, and conscientiously believing the institution of Freemasony vicious and mischievous, they had zealously pursued their opposition to it, until a Law of the Commonwealth prohibited the administration of secret Oaths— It broke up for the time, the Order of Free-Masons in Massachusetts, and the Order of Odd fellows a spurious breed from the same Stock sunk with it.— They were suppressed, but not extinguished, and after an interval of seven years have reappeared, and are annoying the community with their grotesque exhibitions and their gaudy processions— They are multiplying with extraordinary rapidity, and as they openly avow that secret proceedings are essential to their institution they excite fears and jealousies in the portion of the community not initiated in their mysteries— I mentioned Mr Gassett’s correspondence with the six unitarian ministers members of the Order, and said I thought the reason assigned by Mr Huntington, the only one of the six who had answered the enquiry why he had become a member of the order was not satisfactory— I observed that not one of these six clergymen was named as having been present, or taken a part in the celebration of yesterday, but that three other clergymen, named Norris, Chapin and Leigh, were, and did. Mr Lunt said he believed those three clergymen were all Universalists— He added that he knew nothing of the reasons which had induced the six unitarian ministers to join the order, and had taken no interest in himself— Though he had observed with much surprize the revival of the institution—the affectation of publicity given to their proceedings, and the extraordinary numbers said to be flocking to their standards— A man by the name of Benjamin Knowlton came a mendicant for charity— Has been an emigrant from the State of New-York to Michigan; but has been unfortunate and met with many disasters one of which was that out of 17 children by two wives, he lost five by a storm on Lake Erie last October— I rode over Milton hill, and bridge to Dorchester returning along by the Neponset stream with Miss Smith and Mrs Charles. Mr Beale and his daughters this evening at Charles’s. "

A light shower this morning, and a heavy one this afternoon— My Son was here this morning, and I had a long conversation with him upon private concerns and family arrangements of deep interest to him and his children, and to me, and the other members of my family; and on plans which we have been some time contemplating for future execution. In 1837. he built a house on the hill opposite my dwelling house in Quincy, where he has lived in the Summer Season with his family from that time.— Its situation and prospects are exquisitely beautiful; but as his family increases, its dimensions become inadequate for their comfort, and the Old colony Railroad, now in the process of construction from Boston to Plymouth approaches so near to it that it will lose many of its comforts as a dwelling house for him and may appretiate in value as an article for sale or rent— He thinks therefore of building another house upon Mount Wollaston for his own Summer Residence, and of taking that farm under his own management— As I daily draw nearer to the close of life, a deepening concern affects me for the future prospects of my posterity— Through a long, busy, and eventful life, I have collected a library of great value, large for that of a private citizen in this Country, and of which my Son has the means and the disposition to make the most advantageous use— My father’s manuscript books and papers, bequeathed by him to me, and my own, little less important; those of my Son, which with the divine blessing humbly and anxiously implored may become equally interesting to after ages, are and will be exposed unless some provision shall be made for preserving them, to the daily and nightly chances and dangers of fire, in a wooden building more than 100 years old, amidst the perpetual fiery shower of a railroad. I have therefore longed for the means of erecting a durable fire proof building connected with my son’s future residence, for the preservation of this library and these family vouchers and records— These purposes are as yet but in embryo— The result of our conversation this day was that my Son will undertake to build for himself a stone dwelling house on mount Wollaston, connected with which shall be a fire proof building to contain my library, and manuscript books and papers to be bequeathed to him. That I will convey to him the whole Mount Wollaston Estate in fee; and that this shall be received by him as an advance on his portion of my Estate— Thus far for the present— And I pray that there may be no vain presumption to avert the vicissitudes ordained for the condition of human life by the Laws of Nature’s God, mingled up in my heart with this design— Its necessary expence I hope may be defrayed by the increased value of my landed Estate in Quincy to be expected from the quarries and the railway— I rode this afternoon with Miss Smith and Arthur, and took Miss Samson home to Braintree— She has been some time, working for Mrs Charles, who did not ride with us this afternoon. My Son spent the evening with us. His sons left us and went home. "

                "text": "22. IV. Sunday.  The rhumatism hangs by me and depresses and admonishes me. And other trials await me. I received a Letter from my wife at Washington, written last Sunday, advising me that she proposed to leave that city on her way hither, on the next Wednesday, and on Saturday, yesterday, to come by the Long Island Railway from New-York to Boston— We expected and waited for her Saturday Evening till eleven O’Clock—and yesterday till the hour for morning service— Mr Stearns of Hingham was the preacher— His text was the second clause of the verse Job 5.17. Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth; therefore “despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.”— This discourse was upon the benefits of affliction, and upon the duty of bearing in meekness, humility and resignation the chastising hand of God.— I felt the text as applicable to my own condition—labouring with disease, and disappointed in the hope of receiving my wife by her still returning illness— The Stoic philosophy taught the endurance of pain and suffering with Fortitude— The Book of Job teaches us to bear it as chastisement from the hand of God, inflicted to promote our own happiness and bids us not to despise it— And this doctrine is sanctioned and enforced in the New Testament Hebrews 12.5–10.— The Christian doctrine administers consolation and hope and is eminently promotive of virtue. The Stoics inculcated a principle contrary to nature and truth— Its argument was entirely selfish, and leaned upon a broken read— It had no promise for the future; no responsibility of man to his maker— The afflicted Christian who follows his vocation suffers less and enjoys more than the Stoic who belies his own consciousness by denying that pain is an evil. Mr Stearns dined with us. I received a Letter from Walter Hellen, written last Wednesday, the day which my wife had fixed for her departure from Washington.— He says she has had one of her attacks, not so severe as some that have preceded, but it has compelled her to postpone her departure for some days. She will take care to have us apprized of the day when she will set out. Mr Stearns’s afternoon text was the second clause of Luke 2:49. And he said unto them, how is it that ye sought me? “Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?” The reason assigned by Jesus even in the age of childhood for withdrawing from his parents, without claiming exemption from their authority was to be about his father’s business— And as his father is our father, Mr Stearns considers it as an injunction of duty upon every follower of Christ to be about his father’s business— I finished reading the Letters of President Wayland to Dr Richard Fuller, and read one of Dr Fuller’s Letters in reply.— I read also in the American Review for May last the critique on the Vestiges of the Natural history of Creation.

Monday  The morning was cold and damp, with a sprinkling of rain, and my disease pinched me with flying pains which relaxed of their severity as the sky cleared off and the atmosphere became warm and dry; but ceased not to remind me of their presence— Mr Henry Thayer and Mr Winnet of Randolph called on me, and said that the inhabitants of that town proposed to have a celebration this year, on the 4th. of July, and would be much gratified then or at any other time convenient to me to have an address from me— They were both strangers to me, and produced no authority or commission for their visit— I told them it would give me great pleasure to address the inhabitants of Randolph and especially on the 4th. of July— That Randolph was a part of my native town of Braintree, and although as well as Quincy separated from it, for now more than half a century, I still consider myself a native of the whole town of Braintree as it was at the time of my birth— That labouring under a severe attack of rhumatism, from which I have no hope of being wholly released before the approaching 4th. of July, I regretted that it would not be in my power to speak in public at that time; but I hoped that before the next Session of Congress some opportunity will present itself, when I shall be able to address in person the inhabitants of Randolph, as I have repeatedly done to the Inhabitants of Quincy and of Braintree— They acquiesced apparently satisfied with this decision— Mr Winnet said he was a brother of a man, who had lost his hand in firing a salute on the 4th. of July 1825, the year of my inauguration as President of the United States— Harvey Field was here, teeming as usual with projects of purchase and sales of Land, laying out, altering and repairing of roads, building of stone fences, and railroad speculations— He had also a subscription paper to procure for the singers of the first congregational church, a new organ in the place of the one which they have had for several years; the only complaint against which I have heard is that it came at second hand from Trinity church Boston. Mr Field spoke also of a proposal from the purchasers of Captain J Souther’s Mill to buy a nine acre lot of mine, on the town river, adjoining their land, and convenient to them for the construction of a wharf— I did not incline to sell, for the present— John Quincy Adams 2. was here— His mother lingers without abatement of her disease— I received a Letter from my Grand daughter Mary-Louisa at Washington, written last Friday— My wife was better and hoping to get down stairs to dinner the next day— I wrote also to my other grand daughter Louisa Catherine at Lenox enclosing the Evening Gazette of last Saturday— This afternoon I rode with Mrs Charles and Arthur by the Quincy point road to Braintree— Charles took his son John Quincy this morning to School, at Boston, and after a cloudy Sunset spent the evening here.

Tuesday  The longest day of the year has passed away and henceforth the daily movement of the Sun will be Southward, and the daily portion of light for 6 months abridged— My disease has broken up my daily morning pilgrimage up the hill to greet the rising Sun, but I still almost every clear evening drag myself up to witness his setting beam.— I had a morning visit from the fishmonger Samuel Andrews, with his usual fare of Cod, Haddock, Halibut, and Mackerel; and the unusual article of one Salmon, weighing 13 pounds— The prices of Cod and Halibut have been from time immemorial 3 cents a pound— Mackrel from 10 to 12 1/2 cents, haddock from 10 to 15 cents a piece. The price of the Salmon was from 20 to 22 cents a pound, and frequently half a dollar— There is very little difference of taste for an epicure, between the halibut, the cod and the Salmon, but the relish of the palate is for the costly food— I received this morning a Letter from the Postmaster General Cave Johnson, informing me according to his promise, that application has been made to him from North-Bridgwater for the removal of the Postmaster Edward Southworth junr.— The complaints against him are all of a party character— I immediately enclosed the Letter to Mr Jesse Perkins, with a tender of any service in my power to aid Mr Southworth or his friends if they think proper to meet and repel the charges— I gathered the few cherries left by the birds, on the small budded tree in the centre of the Seminary. They are now so nearly ripe that the only way to save them from human depredation in addition to that of the birds is to gather them— There is a great variety of operation in the growth of my seedling trees.— The aphis seizes almost all the top shoots of the apples and pears and arrest at once their growth upwards— The effect of this may be to strengthen the stem— The growth of the shagbark walnut is most perplexing.— Its life depends upon the formation of the top bud, and that is very uncertain— The second shoot from the English white Oak is just showing itself, and one of the willow slips which I stuck down to guard a young shagbark, has already sprouted up.— The transplanted shagbark in the Seminary is in perilous condition— The developement of the buds into leaves, is so slow and languid that I apprehend its failure— This was the day of the celebration of the Freemason revival on Bunker’s hill— An appendix to the festival of the Odd Fellows— Our afternoon ride was superseded by two very heavy showers— With Miss Smith and Mrs Charles I attended a tea party at Mr Lunt’s. Charles came in afterwards— A Mr and Mrs Taylor with a little daughter were there from Boston and two Misses Hedge Cousins of Mrs Lunt— Also Mr Lunt’s Aunt Mrs Pearson.— I read two of Dr Richard Fuller’s letters to President Wayland, in defence of Slavery.

I received this morning a Letter from my wife at Washington, dated last Saturday, announcing her intention to leave that city yesterday, and her wish that our Son would meet her at New-York, with some doubt whether Walter Hellen would come on with her. I took the Letter immediately up the hill and read it to my Son, who concluded to go for New-York by the Stonington Cars this afternoon— Fuller took him to Boston and returned by Noon— John came out in the Stage— Mr Gould came out with his Son Benjamin Apthorp, graduated at Harvard University at the last Commencement— He has made great proficiency in mathematical studies, and has a special taste for Astronomy— He is now going to visit the high school at Philadelphia to examine their telescope which has acquired some reputation, and Washington to inspect the Frauenhofer Refractor there— I gave him a Letter of introduction to Lieutenant Maury. He proposes also to visit some of the principal observatories in Europe, and his father requested a Letter to Mr Airy, the Astronomer royal of Great Britain, which I promised to give him— Mr Gassett and Mr Odiorne were here this afternoon, and brought me some additional books and pamphlets relating to Free-Masonry— The order celebrated yesterday the festival of Saint John at Bunker-hill in Charlestown, with all their pageantry, to the number of nearly one thousand, including 75 knights templars.— The Odd-fellows outnumber them ten to one, but are despised by them— This tenacity of existence, and of burlesque display of magnificence, in the gross imposture of Freemasonry is one of the speckeld pages of human nature— Mummery and mischief under the mask of charity and benevolence embrace the whole compass of Free-masonry.— Mr Gassett told me that it had been recently ascertained that Benedict Arnold was a Freemason, and he intimated a suspicion that it was under the influence of Masonic obligations that he was suffered to escape, which I do not believe— I read a Letter from Dr Fuller to President Wayland in defence of Slavery. This discussion has a tendency to promote the principle of abolition— Fuller takes his stand upon the extreme point of his cause. He denies that Slavery is under all circumstances and without exception a sin, and his main argument is the express authority and sanction of God in the old testament, and the permission, or absence of prohibition of it in the New. The resort to these arguments is the most conclusive evidence of the desperation of the cause itself— Dr Fuller resolves the dispute at last into a question whether despotic Government is a sin, and affirms that it is not— I rode this afternoon with Mrs Charles and Arthur to Randolph, but lost our way and travelled about 25 miles on a stretch from 5 to half past 8 O’Clock before we reached home. We had left Miss Smith at Mr John Greenleaf’s, an took her up as we returned. "

The pleasure that I take in witnessing these magnificent phenomena of physical nature, never tires. It is a part of my own nature, unintelligible to others, and I suppose a singularity which I should suppress or renounce. The sensations which affect me at the rising and setting Sun, are first, of Adoration to the power and goodness of the creator of this wonderful universe mingled in the morning with thanksgiving for the return of the great luminary of heaven, the source of life and of light—in the evening with sadness at the departure of this greatest of blessings, with a conscious sense of the dependance of all animated nature, upon the constant beneficence of the creator, and with humble supplication for forgiveness of my own errors, and infirmities, and for the continuance of the never ceasing bounties of the omnipotent and all seeing God— These sentiments are always the same, and are rather quickened than deadened by repetition— I take pleasure in indulging them, and wish that my conscience could testify to the influence of these sentiments on my conduct in life— I went this morning to Boston, with Louisa C. Smith and Mrs Charles.— We left Miss Smith at Mr James H. Fosters.— I alighted at the apartments of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and attended their monthly meeting— There were about 17 members in attendance— I presented to the Society the Majority and Minority Reports of the Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States, on the recent insurrection against the Charter Government of Rhode-Island.— I offered them as a sequel to the three annual reports of the Commissioner of Patents and with a view to form a collection of select Congressional Documents— A vote was passed to have them bound with that title— The meeting adjourned soon after one. I then stop’d at Raymond the watchma shop, and took the watch I had left there to be repaired— I then called at Dr Jacob Bigelow’s house and consulted him respecting this thorn in the flesh which nearly through this whole month has tormented me and disabled me for all useful labour— I gave him an account of the symptoms with which I have been afflicted, and which are constantly varying.— The Doctors advice finally settled into a recommendation of a mustard poultice, a remedy which I propose to postpone for the present We returned home to Quincy to dine, and I suffered more pain throug this day, than I have in any other day since the first attack.

Yesterday was one of the severest days of the affliction with which I have been visited for nearly this whole month, and I went to bed last night with gloomy forebodings of this day— This morning I rose, much relieved from pain, and continued easier the whole day— I received a Letter from my wife, dated last Tuesday. She was still so feeble that she had been advised not to leave Washington, that day, but she intended to start on Wednesday; to stop one day—this day—at New York—to come by the Long Island Railway to Boston to-morrow, and either to come out to morrow evening in a hack, or to take lodging for the night at the United States Hotel, and come out on Sunday morning. Mrs Smith will not come for the present Miss Cutts will—and a woman— I received also a note from George H. Colton without date, but post marked the 24th. Tuesday, enclosing the proof pages of the Lecture on Society and Civilization 10 pages with double columns— The note states that if possible he would be glad to receive it again Thursday afternoon— I immediately revised the proof and corrected at least 20 errors of the press. I despatched it by this day’s mail, with the hope that Mr Colton will receive it to-morrow morning— I rode this afternoon in the barouche from 5 to 7— O’Clock with Mrs Charles, Elizabeth C. Adams whom we took up at her mother’s and Arthur, by the Quincy point and Braintree roads, and went up the hill just in time to miss the setting of the Sun— Mr Beales two daughters were there.— I came home, and was the first time for nearly a month able to write an hour after the evening bell— These afternoon rides are extremely pleasant to me, but they consume precious time, and nothing but my suffering state of health can apologize for my self indulgence in them. The lounge about my garden nursery and seminary to observe the progress of vegetation in my seedling trees is time more excusably, and ought to be more profitably spent— This the sixteenth Summer in succession which I have passed in this house, and in which I have devoted many hours to the raising of fruit and forest trees from the stone the acorn and the nut— I have raised many trees, and failed to raise many more— Their preservation through the first summer and winter of their existence, is the principal difficulty in their cultivation and transplantation is the next. The process of vegetation sometimes exceedingly slow, and in other cases surprizingly rapid, baffles all reasoning, and makes me feel my poverty of invention— I have now growing at least 25 Shagbark walnuts, of one, two and three years growth, of which it is doubtful whether they can be made to survive this Summer, and the next winter— The transplanted tree in the Seminary is in the semi condition, and the opening buds which had the most promising appearance has been followed by a feeble and drooping developement of leaves altogether discouraging.

I had no return of it this day [symbols]— I might have resumed my labours of duty, but did not— Mr Joshua Leavitt came out from Boston, with a young Englishman named Barrett, who has been about two months travelling in this country, and came to see me as a curiosity.— They came in the 12. O’Clock Stage, with my grandson John Quincy from school and returned by the 3. O’Clock stage to Boston. They dined with us in the interval, upon a tough Beef-steak and a plain flour pudding, materials perhaps hereafter for a chapter in Mr Barrett’s travels— He had a small album, and asked me for an autograph which I gave him— I wasted hours in my Nursery, Garden and Seminary, studying the progress of vegetation in my seedling trees, in vain— Mr Lunt came in and spent a silent half-hour with me— Mr and Mrs Loring of Hingham returning from Boston stop’d and he spoke about one or more fishing parties this summer.— I received this morning a Letter from my grand-daughter Louisa-Catherine at Lenox, and at Sunset I took it up the hill to her mother— There was a gentle sprinkling of rain all the evening, and at the stroke of the evening bell at 9. the family from Washington with my Son, arrived in a Hack from Boston— My wife, Mrs John Adams and her daughter Mary Louisa, Miss Cutts, and Walter Hellen; and a French femme de chambre.— They came in one day—Wednesday, from Washington to New-York—and this day from New-York by the Long-Island Railway to Boston, and thence here— The accidents in Steamers and on Railroads are so frequent and so fatal, that a load of apprehension always weighs upon my spirits whenever I know that persons dear to me are travelling upon them, and I speed a blessing on the moment when the journey’s end is reached in safety. I am drawing to the conclusion of the Correspondence between President Wayland, and Dr Richard Fuller upon the sinfulness of Domestic Slavery— The ingenuity and intense anxiety of Dr Fuller to escape from this principle indicates the last resort of the Slave-holder to evade the wrath to come— There is one remark in the last Letter of President Wayland, at the simplicity of which I could not choose but smile— After lavishing upon his correspondent all the language of endearment, and all the vocabulary of admiration on the temper and talent of his correspondent’s defence of Slavery, he tells him there is one thing which throughout the whole discussion he has entirely forgotten or overlooked—namely the distinction between right and wrong. It is so. "

                "text": "29. IV:15. Sunday.  Mr Lunt preached this morning from Ecclesiastes 3.1. “To every thing there is a Season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:[”]— He had given out as the first hymn to be sung the 138th. of the Christian Psalter, his compilation, and the hymn book now used in our church. It was my version of the 65th. Psalm, and no words can express the sensations with which I heard it sung— Were it possible to compress into one pulsation of the heart the pleasure which in the whole period, of my life I have enjoyed in praise from the lips of mortal man, it would not weigh a straw to balance the ecstacy of delight which streamed from my eyes, as the organ pealed and the choir of voices rung the praise of almighty God from the soul of David adapted to my native tongue by me— To this thrill of rapture the composition of which I dare not analyse there was one drawback— In the printed book, the 5th. line of the second Stanza reads “The morning’s dawn, the evening’s shade” and so it was sung—but the corresponding 7th. line of the same Stanza reads“The fields from thee the rains receive” totally destroying the rhyme. I instantly saw that the 5th. line should read “The morning’s dawn, the shades of eve.” but whether this enormous blunder was committed by the copyist or the pressman I am left to conjecture— That it was committed by me is scarcely possible. The correction is so obvious, that it could scarcely escape the notice of any intelligent reader of English versification— The Sermon was ingenious and eloquent, but somewhat eccentric, embracing remarks upon the melancholy paroxysms of Swift and Cowper, and a critique and commentary upon Shakespear’s Hamlet— The specifications of the opposite objects for which the royal preacher says there are appropriate times has one item which the purer morality of Jesus Christ has reformed. He says there is a time to love and a time to hate— The precept of Christ, forbids hatred at all times, and probably with reference to this very passage commands his disciples to love their enemies— Mr Lunt’s afternoon text was Matthew 6.23. “But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness.” This language is so entirely figurative that is not easy to discern its practical preceptive application. If explained by the verses which precede and follow it to the end of the chapter it is an admirable exhortation to suppress the instigations of avarice, and the passion for amassing inordinate wealth—but it must not be understood as countenancing indolence or indifference to the acquisition of the necessaries and comforts of life— The precept is to provide first for the wants of the Soul, and that will enlighten you, in the search of means to provide for the wants of physical nature—food, and rayment— My Son, and his wife and passed midshipman John Quincy Adams 2d. spent the evening with us.

A cold Northeast wind, threatening rain continued through this whole day, and drove us to the necessity of having a fire made in our dining parlour— The most unaccountable thing to me is that at this most unnatural return of winter to close the month of June, the Sciatica which has so severely afflicted me from the beginning of the month, has departed, and given me a respite from pain which in humble hope I pray may continue, without requiring even the mustard poultice recommended by Dr Bigelow.— My Son took his eldest boy to his school at Boston; went and attended an annual meeting of the Stockholders of a Cotton factory at Dover in New-Hampshire; dined there, and returned this evening to Boston and home— An easy travel of 140 miles by railways in a day. Walter Hellen went also to Boston and returned towards evening.— I visited my seedling trees watching the signs of vegetation of my shagbark walnuts in all their stages, but unable to account for the blights which strangle them in their growth— I gathered a small basket of the red cherries which are not yet quite ripe. They would be so if left on the tree about the 15th. of July—but neither birds nor boys will suffer them to remain till that time— The mazzards will ripen about the same time, but I have two young mazzard trees in front of our western windows one of which open to the Sun, will ripen its fruit at least a fortnight sooner than the other shaded by White Mulberry trees North-west of it— The second shoot of the seedling English white oaks, is pushing out dubiously, and the unfolding leaves of the transplanted shagbark are drooping. [symbols]. Instead of resuming my proper occupation, I gave the leisure of this day to looking up and assorting a collection of pamphlets for the book-binder— I now assorted only 6. of more than 100 that I propose to have bound in the course of this Summer— I called at the shop ofMarsh, and bespoke a pair of shoes— Then at the Post Office, and left the Evening Gazette of last Saturday for Louisa Catherine at Lenox— I went into the cemetery, and visited the tombstones of my first English Ancestors in America Henry and Joseph Adams senior— I met there John Leary, at the wall they are building from the New granite town house westward. He told me he had returned two years since from Ireland, after paying over to his father all the property left by his brother Jeremy— That he had built him a new house, and was living honestly and comfortably in it— I saw they had planted young trees in the grave-yard and covered the ground around their roots with seaweed, heaped down with a circle of large stones.— I stop’d at the Quincy Aurora Office and left there three congressional documents— At Mr Lunts I pointed out to him the error in the 138th. hymn of his Christian Psalter, and requested him to have it corrected in as many of the books as he could, which he promised to have done— I found that Dr Belknap had omitted one Stanza, and altered another of Watts’s 100th. psalm. We passed the evening by the fireside. Charles and his wife, and Mr Beale were here. "

Tuesday  The return of Winter cold at this precise period was too severe a trial to the shattered constitution of my wife who was seized yesterday with a most distressing cough, soon followed by a burning fever, a sleepless night, and an almost breathless day. Dr Woodward was called in and precribed medicines to subdue the fever— There was some abatement of the severest symptoms this evening— This was the day for the annual meeting of the Directors, and proprietors of the Neponset Bridge— The dinner was to be at Mr Moseley’s in Dorchester— Mr Moseley sent his son to notify me that the party was postponed to some day next week on account of the unfavouble state of the weather. I received this notice just at noon, glad to be released from a pleasure party with a temper of Spirit so unsuited to it, and a heart so burdened. This afternoon I took to the Book binder some 25 pamphlets to be bound in 10 very thick volumes, among which are the Session Messages of the 25th. 26th. 27th. and 28th. Congresses. It absorbed the afternoon— I answered and declined the invitation to the Dane Law School dinner the day after to-morrow— I should have recorded yesterday the daily consumption of my time during the month of June— I rose in the range from half past 3 to half past 5. and gave an hour and a half on the average to washing, scrubbing, dressing and occasionally ascending the hill to see the Sunrise— Two thirds of the time intermitted by the pain of the Sciatica— Then 2 hours till breakfast and two hours after reading the morning Newspapers—Atlas—Courier, Morning Chronicle—Letters by the Mail, and pamphlets upon miscellaneous subjects— Time which I consider principally wasted, but have not the fortitude to redeem by renouncing once for all the reading of this trash, scarcely a trace of which remains after the day has passed, upon my Memory. On Sundays there is no mail brought to me, and I usually have the journal of the preceding day written before the call of the bell to the morning service— The other days of the week I seldom have the record of the day before completed before dinner. I visit my garden, Nursery and Seminary, at all hours of the day whenever the humour takes me, but my disease has disabled me from working with the spade and the hoe, the axe and the Saw— A grievous disappointment. A Siesta of two hours after dinner, a ride of two more with Mrs Charles, Miss Smith, and Arthur, a walk up the hill to see the Sunset, occasional completing of the page of Journal begun before dinner; occasional writing or copying of a Letter—calls to casual visitors, desultory reading, and rank naked idleness bring the day to a close at Sunset. My Son usually spends the short Summer evening here, and from 10 to 11. at Night I retire to short repose to the morning twilight. "

F. S. Griffin West Newbury, from whom I received this morning a Letter requesting one.— He put them into the Post-Office at Boston.— I also received a Letter from S. C. Phillips, Charles Allen and C. F. Adams, a Committee appointed by the Convention of the People of Massachusetts, opposed to the annexation of Texas, held at Faneuil Hall on the 24th. of January last, to provide for immediate communication with the opponents of annexation in this and other States as soon as any emergency should be deemed to require a general consultation. They deem such an emergency to have occurred by the passage of the joint Resolution of Congress providing for the admission of Texas into the Union and presuming that it is not yet too late for a concerted movement in opposition to the consummation of the measure, the call for my opinion in regard to the expediency of it, and the manner in which it may best be undertaken and conducted— My afternoon rides being superseded by the arrival of my family, I have devoted a large portion of them to the drudgery of assorting my pamphlets for the book binder and to making up collections of my own published writings for my Son, my Grand daughter Mary-Louisa, and others who are to survive me— I made a table of contents to the second volume of the collection for my Son—took to the book binders a second set of the Session Messages of the 25th. Congress, and the first volume of the Omnibus collection for a sample— Mr Gill was gone to Boston.— Returning home I stop’d at Charles’s house, and took the second Volume of Miscellaneous American State papers of Gales and Seaton’s Collection. A premonitory symptom for the resumption of my Lecture on the patent office— Henry Hardwick was here this morning about his purchase of a patch of my land; and complaining that Harvey Field had again broken up his bars across the lane near his house An ancient passage way— Doctor Woodward visited here— Charles and his wife spent the evening with us.

Thursday  My wife had a better night than the two preceding and was convalescent all this day— On Tuesday the 1st. of this month the Steamer Caledonia, Captain Lott cleared from Boston for Liverpool; and last Evening the Steamer Acadia Captain Harrison at 10. O’Clock arrived at East-Boston from Liverpool, whence she cleared on the 19th. of last Month. The Steamer Britannia, cleared from Boston 1. June, arrived at Liverpool, on the morning of the 13th. and the Steamer Hibernia arrived at Boston on the 6th. and departed again for Liverpool on the 16th. of May.— The Britannia left Liverpool the 4th. and arrived at Boston the 19th. of May— The average passage of these Steamers is 13 days from Boston to Liverpool and 15 days from Liverpool to Boston, including the stoppage at Halifax both ways— Yesterday and this day the chilling and grating North-east wind which had lighted our fires the two preceding days, came back from the Southwest, cold and raw yesterday—warming and freshening all last Night, and descending in tepid showers all this day, with a very heavy flashing and pealing lightning and thunder this afternoon, and closing with a clear Sunset and a magnificent rain-bow. Walter Hellen went with John Q. Adams 2. passed midshipman to Hingham, and returned at evening twilight in the midst of the drenching showers. My Son at 6 this morning to school at Boston, and returned home to dine. John came home in Gillet’s Stage for the holiday to-morrow. I received the plates engraved from my portrait by Marchant, which my family all think hideous, also, from Mr Richard Rush his second volume on his residence at the Court of London— An account of all the dinners at which he attended in the 8 years of his Mission to Great Britain— But the men women and things of that day in England, and elsewhere are obsolete ideas— A man by the name of Aaron B Smith, now of Philadelphia, but a native of Athol in Worcester County in this Commonwealth came on a visit of curiosity to see me— His wife is a native of New-Hampshire. She has two Sisters married in this town. Two married in Boston, and two maiden sisters living with them— One other sister married in some country town.— They came from Philadelphia to visit these family relations whom they had not seen these eight years, and while here Mr. Smith thought he might as well come and see me.— I have no return of Sciatica, which is a blessing not to be forgotten. I made out the table of contents to the 3d. volume of my miscellanies, collected for a present to my Son— I had no time left for reading or for any thing else. I wanted to write some remarks, upon the correspondence between President Wayland and Dr Richard Fuller, upon Slavery, which I have finished reading— The attempt of the Slavemongers to support their institution upon principles of morality and religion presents the question of Slavery under a new and memorable aspect.

Morning visit from Mr Benjamin Hobart of Abington, with his wife, two daughters, Helen and Mary from 10 to 14 years old and one son John, a boy of 8 or 9. Mr Hobart told me he had had 12 children 9 of whom are living two married in Boston—one at school at Exeter New Hampshire, and one at Philadelphia— He thanked me for sundry public documents which I have sent him, and particularly for the proceedings of the Lord’s day convention at Baltimore last November, and judge Halls plea for the Sabbath— And he gave me a life of Emanuel Swedenborg translated by his nephew Nathan Hobart, and a translation of Swedenborg’s work concerning Heaven and Hell. Mr Hobart informed me that after a long and deliberate examination of Swedenborg’s writings he had become a believer in his doctrines, and a convert to his new church— That there were many others of the same faith— They had gathered a Society at Abington and built a church where he usually worshiped— In the Massachusetts Register of the present year this church is noted and Joseph Pettee named as its Minister— Mr Hobart enquired if I was conversant with the works of Swedenborg and what my opinion of him was— I told him I had heard much of Swedenborg, for more than 60 years— Had read parts of some of his works, and had a general idea of his system with regard to the sympathetic relations between the physical and the spiritual world— But I believed his confident assertion of his own personal intercourse with unembodied Spirits, was mere self deception, Creations of a bewildered imagination to the flights of which I could yield no confidence— Mr Hobart defended his creed with some earnestness, and evident conviction that my impressions were the effect of mere preconception and obstinate prejudice—while I marvel at the gullability even of the intelligent, upright, and sober portion of mankind— Mrs Frothingham with two of her sons Edward and Ward, and her two daughters Ann and Ellen came out from Boston, and spent the day with her Sister Mrs. Charles— Another set of visitors all Strangers, Mr and Mrs Lawrence Meyers, with a daughter—Mr and Mrs A. C. Moore of Plattsburg—Mr Doremus and his daughter, Mr Hennison of South Carolina and his daughter—Mr P. A Stone and and Miss G. Parker of Boston, a full freighted Omnibus came out and passed an hour with me, before dinner— I gave the afternoon to a table of Contents for the 4th. Volume of my Miscellanies for my Son, which I did so carelessly that I shall have to do it over again— My wife recovers slowly. Mrs. Charles spent the Evening with us. "

                "text": "5. III.45 Saturday  Walter Hellen left us this Morning for New-York and Washington. Perhaps to come back at some future day— Miss Cutts received yesterday morning a letter from her brother James Madison Cutts written in my house in F. Street, Washington City, last Tuesday— At 2. O’Clock on the morning of that day a fire had broken out in the boarding house of Mrs Bihler; three doors west of the part of my house, occupied by Albion K. Parris and his family— The three houses were burnt to the ground; the fire was arrested at my house—the roof of the back building of which was kindled, and damaged in several small places— Mr Cutts and the Revd. Mr Pyne contributed by great exertions to save the house— This morning I received a Letter from Mr Frye, written on the same day, and repeating the same Statement, with the additional incident, that his son Dr T. B. J. Frye, aided in preserving our house by causing wet blankets to be spread over the roof— Blessed be the name of God for this deliverance from a calamity which has kept me in a constant alarm of anticipation for the last year.— The assortment of pamphlets and separation of the public documents from the rest absorbs all my leisure time— Visit this afternoon from Mr Samuel Swett, and Mr Charles S. Daveis of Portland. Mr. Daveis had written to me that he would come to converse with me about his projected life of Genl. Henry Knox— He spoke to me of a recent discovery by Mrs Hamilton, widow of Alexander Hamilton of the papers of her father Genl Schuyler—vastly important—and he spoke of a life of Jeremy Bentham by Dr Bowring in which are some strange revelations respecting Aaron Burr and Hamilton— Mr Daveis discoursed also upon the 3d. volume of Hutchinson’s history of Massachusetts-Bay, Governor James Bowdoin and his family— This conversation was exceedingly interesting, and I should gladly have prolonged it— I received also 3 copies of Number 1. of the American Weekly Reviewer, or Old School Oracl of Health and General Advertiser—published at Portland Maine, on the 4th. of this Month— This number contains a copy of the imperfect report of my Address to the Massachusetts Historical Society, on the New-England confederacy of 1643. published immediately after its delivery in a Boston Newspaper— The Editor of this paper says that he heard it delivered and speaks in high commendation of it— A reminiscence of any publication of mine two years after its first appearance is of so rare occurence that I cannot pass over the notice of it— Mr Beale was here this evening and said that the dinner of the Neponset Bridge proprietors at Mr Mosely’s house at Dorchester was now fixed for next Tuesday at 2 O’Clock P.M. My Son told me that Charles Sumner, who delivered the city Anniversary entered so deep on controversial revolution as to produce an explosion which was echoed and re-echoed at the dinner. "

                "text": "6. IV. Sunday.  Sun rose 4.29. Set 7.39. day 15 hours. Mr Frederic Augustus Whitney the second and eldest surviving Son of the late Peter Whitney Pastor of the first Congregational Society and Church in Quincy, officiated this day in exchange with Mr Lunt— He is settled as a Minister at Brighton— He preached this morning from Leviticus 19.32 [“]Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head and honour the face of the old man” omitting the remainder of the verse—“and fear thy God— I am the Lord.” From the 16th to the 24th. Chapter of Leviticus, inclusive is a summary repetition of sundry Laws, by special revelation to Moses after the death of Nadab and Abihu the two Sons of Aaron, when they offered before the Lord and died— The 19th. is one of those Chapters and the 32 verse stands by itself. The theme of the discourse was the honour and reverence due to old age— On the 11th. of May last, I heard a Sermon from Mr S. K. Lothrop from Proverbs 16.31. in which old age was considered in a more comprehensive manners. Its honours—its duties—its pleasures—its infirmities— The part of the verse which Mr Whitney this day left out of his text is well derving of meditation. The profound solemnity with which the commandment is delivered is characteristic of the whole Law delivered from Sinai— [“]Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head”— The Israelite is commanded to manifest his reverence for old age by a movement of the body—by rising up before the hoary head—“and honour the face of the old man[”]— This is the sentiment of the heart prescribed at the sight of a man’s face— This mode of inculcating principles is one of the choicest secrets of eloquence—but the omitted words—and fear thy God; I am the Lord, are essential to the Spirit of this Legislation. The command is to reverence old age—but the motive urging to obedience is the fear of God and the duty of submission to his will— The closing words, I am the Lord, repeated at the close of every Law was a continual reminding of the people that the Law proceeded directly from Jehovah the creator of all worlds— Mr Whitney dined with us, and Mr and Mrs Downing of Newburgh New-York, who came over from Mr Benjamin Guilds at Brookline where they have been passing a week, and whither they returned this evening— The text of Mr Whitney’s afternoon Sermon was from Ecclesiastes 5.1. “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God.” again omitting the remainder of the verse—“and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil”— Here again is a principle inculcated by enjoining a movement of the body— Keep thy foot Mr Whitney said was an allusion to the practice of putting off shoes to enter upon holy ground; as is now customary to uncover the head— The precept is reverence in entering a church— Mr Whitney complained that in the manners of the age there was a culpable neglect of this observance—but it has come very seldom under my observation. I saw the Sun rise and set from the hill. Charles and his wife spent the evening here. "

We have the first news that the Congress of Texas assembled on the 17th. of last Month immediately and by unanimous votes of both houses accepted the terms prescribed by the joint Resolution of the Congress of the United States of the first of March last for annexing Texas to the United States, and that the Senate of Texas have unanimously rejected the Treaty, negotiated for them by the ministers of France and Great Britain with Mexico— If the voice of the People is the voice of God, this measure has now the sanction of almighty God— I have opposed it for ten long years, firmly believing it tainted with two deadly crimes. 1. The leprous contamination of Slavery and 2. Robbery of Mexico.— Victrix Causa deo placuit. The Sequel is in the hands of Providence, and the ultimate result may signally disappoint those, by whom this enterprize has been consummated— Fraud and Rapine, are at its foundation— They have sown the wind— If they reap the whirlwind, the being who left to the will of man the improvement of his own condition, will work it out, according to his own good pleasure— I had a morning visit from Mr Ezekiel Bacon of Utica in the State of New-York, with Mrs Colt of Pittsfield, one of his daughters— Mr Bacon was forty years ago a member of the house of Representatives of the United States from the County of Berkshire in this Commonwealth, as his father John Bacon had been before him— He afterwards removed to the State of New-York, and held some office of distinction— He was then for several years afflicted with melancholy, a disease of body and mind and confined to his chamber, where he composed much gloomy poetry: a small volume of which he published under the title of AEgri Somnia. Between two and three years since he recovered from his dark Splenetics, and sallied forth again upon the world. He travels about, and scribbles prose and poetry, and publishes Newspaper Essays and keeps himself alive and merry— When I was at Utica two years ago, he was in full activity, and extremely kind to me— He has two daughters married in the County of Berkshire, and Mrs Colt one of them is travelling with him— My apology for doing nothing this day was the Summer heat which set in with all its fierceness. Charles took his Son John Quincy to School at Boston; but returned himself to dine— I wasted great part of the day in overhawling old pamphlets and public documents— I wrote to the Postmaster General Cave Johnson, and enclosed to him the Letter last received from Mr Jesse Perkins of North Bridgwater, and the certificate of the select men of that town, against the removal of Mr Southworth as Postmaster— I read a few pages, two or three sections of Swedenborg’s Heaven and Hell; to ascertain if possible what it is that made this man the founder of a religious sect.— It is the absurd and knavish pretension of direct and personal communication with the spiritual world—frequent conversations with two distinct classes of Angels, Celestial and spiritual, and frequent admission to the three Heavens— It is melancholy to remark, what fooleries are made to pass for revelations.

My Son went to Cambridge as a member of a Committee of the Overseers of Harvard University, for the examination of the Students in Greek.

At Mr Thomas Moseley’s house in Dorchester I found the Bridge-party and alighted— The Carriage then took Miss Cutts and Mary Louisa into Boston. Miss Cutts went to Nahant to spend some days with her friend Elizabeth Crowninshield. Mary-Louisa went to Boston, and on her return took me up about half-past 5. O’Clock. In the interval the proprietors of the Neponset Bridge had taken their annual dinner under an open shed of chowder soup, fish fowls and fruit, strawberries, rasberries and cherries, with champagne and Madeira Wine— After which they occupied an hour in rolling the bowls; a sport of which only the younger members of the company partook, including however, Dr Frothingham and Mr Lunt—Mr Wales and Mr Beale— Forty-two years have passed away since the proprietors of the Neponset Bridge were incorporated by the Legislature of Massachusetts— Forty one years and 3 months since on the 14th of April 1804 I first passed it on my return from the first Session of Congress which I attended as a member of the Senate of the United States— The anniversary dinners are of more recent origin— The last 6 or 7 years they have taken place when I have been absent from the State. Of the original proprietors there was now present besides myself only one person, President Josiah Quincy— The bowling in Dorchester brought fresh to my recollection scenes of yet earlier date from 1790 to 1794. when with other young men, then my cotemporaries and associates I frequently spent Summers afternoons in riding out from Boston for a party at Bowls, and when the Saturday Evening club which met in winter at Concert Hall came out and dined at Pierce’s in Dorchester— There is always something sweet and something sad in the remembrance of ancient enjoyments— Robertson in relating a visit of Charles the 5th. in his old age, to Ghent where he was born says he reviewed with a pleasing and tender melancholy the Scenes of his early childhood— My reminiscences are complicated and associated with very different sensations when bearing upon different periods of life— The siege of Boston— The Battles of Lexington and Bunkers hill—the death of my grandmother Smith— The evacuation of Boston, the Small pox and the Declaration of Independence are among the first— Then the pleurisy fever of 1777. the Boston frigate—the voyage to France, the schools of Le Coeur and Pechigny, the return home in the Sensible and the second voyage to Europe the same year— Spain, France, Holland, Russia, Sweden, Denmark—The Hague, Paris—my return home in 1785— I must pause— "

This was the day of the funeral obsequies ordained by the municipal Government of the City of Boston in honour of Andrew Jackson, a mask of a great man Memorable for success in one untimely battle, and infamous for a life of brutal violence, shameless adultery, and numberless frauds closed with a display of calvinistic piety worthy of Moliere’s Tartuffe.— The City Council and board of Aldermen of Boston debated whether to spend 500 or 1500 dollars upon this mourning mockery, and finally compromised upon 1000— There was a long procession military and civil round the democratic Streets, a Eulogy Oration of an hour by Pliny Merrick at Faneuil Hall— A bird of the same feather with his theme; knave democrat, and a cry of lamentation to trumpet up a triumphal jubilee of exultation— Such is yet the nature of man— And so will man continue to be until Slavery shall be abolished on the earth— Oh Lord—how long?— I passed the day in retirement, noticing the death a few days since of George Harrison aged 84 at Phildephia, and of J B. Dawson a worthless member of Congress, in Louisiana. Mr and Mrs Lunt paid us an evening visit— I began an answer to the Letter from Stephen C. Phillips, Charles Allen and C. F. Adams— But lingered. "

A sudden change in the night, with a sort of hurricane flurry, brought the wind from the Northwest to North of East and a gentle breeze from the Sea, cooled my thermometer down from 90 to 70.— Mr Lunt gave out to begin the morning service the 289th hymn of his collection.  I would repeat these lines every morning as the first beam of the rising Sun strikes my eye— The whole hymn is one of Watts’s best—one of his imitations of the 19th. Psalm— Mr Lunt’s morning text was from Acts 10.15. [“]And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.” The chapter contains the narrative of the call by God through the Roman centurion Cornelius at Cesarea, addressed by an Angel, upon the apostle Peter at Joppa to come and speak words to him. At the same time Peter falls into a trance and has a vision of a sheet descending from heaven containing all the animals forbidden by the Levitical laws to be eaten by the jews— A voice commands him to kill and eat— Peter objects that the animals are declared unclean by the Law and are forbidden to be eaten—and says he has never eaten any thing common or unclean— The voice replies what God hath cleansed, that call not thou common—and these words abolished the whole prohibitory code of the Law from Sinai about eating animals—on waking up, he is told that three men are seeking him and ordered to go with them. The co-incidence between the dissolution of prohibitory Laws in the Pentateuch and the angelic mission commanding the centurion Cornelius to send for Peter to come and speak with him without saying about what constitute one of the most remarkable miracles in the Bible— Jesus while he lived disclaimed all intention to intrench upon the Mosaic Law, declaring emphatically that he came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and that he came not to destroy but to fulfil— Many of his commands were incompatible with the Jewish Dispensations, and among them was his last injunction to them to preach the gospel to all Nations— This was impracticable without the revocation of the Jewish Law itself and that was effected by this miracle— Mr Lunt’s sermon was admirable as an exposition of the wrong of rejecting blessings because they are common— Thomas and Octave Frothingham came out and dined at Charles’s and his sons John Quincy and Charles F. dined with us— Mr Lunt preached this afternoon, from James 1.21. [“]Receive with meekness the engrafted word” only a small part of the verse— He carried through the figure of the engrafted word with great Spirit and some sharp censure upon the transcendental dabblers in philosophical theology— Edward Cranch of CinCinnati was here and took tea with us. The two young Frothinghams were here before they returned to the City— My wife was not sufficiently recovered to leave her chamber. Some poppies from self sown seeds in the garden blossomed on my birth-day. "

                "text": "14. III.30. Monday.  Among my reminiscences this morning brought with it the memory that this was my elder Sister’s birth day— Had she lived, she would have been this day four score years of age. She died in 1813. at the age of 48.— Two of her sons are yet living without issue—a third died in childhood—her only daughter, married to John Peter De Windt of Cedar Grove, Fishkill landing, New-York has a large family of children— Her eldest daughter Caroline is married to Andrew Jackson Downing of Newburgh, New-York, with whom she so recently paid us a visit— They have no children— In 1841. he published and dedicated to me a Treatise on the Theory and practice of Landscape Gardening adapted to North America, with a view to the improvement of Country residences, with remarks on rural architecture— This work has been successful, and just now he has published another on the fruits and fruit trees of America, of which he has presented me a copy.— These associations, and many others of mingled yarn, throng to the mind with the recollection of my Sister’s birth day.— The memory of herself is next to that of my mother the tenderest and dearest to my heart of all the sympathies of human life— This day the helplessness of midsummer heat returned— The morning was thick cloudy and sultry— Towards noon the Sun broke through the gloom and the heat became intense. No interruption by Visitors— In the afternoon there was a moderate thunder shower, and two hours of rain after which a flat calm, damp and sultry— Atmospheric Indolence absorbed the day— I opened for curiosity sake a Letter of five very closely written folio-pages, received in September 1827. from Jeremiah Condy of Charleston South Carolina, the seal of which had not before been broken— This poor man wanted an office and being friendly to my administration for the space of nearly two years wrote me such anonymous Letters almost every day, enclosing three Charleston daily newspapers—the City Gazette the Courier and the Mercury. Many of these budgets were received at Washington when I was absent, and heaped up in baskets till I returned, and then I had so many immediate calls upon my time and attention, which could not be postponed that Mr Condy’s despatches were overlooked and remained under Seal—and so have continued to this day. Poor Condy never got his place and has been dead many years.— His Letters would form a secret history of the dirty slavemonger factions of South-Carolina at that time, without a claim to be remembered beyond the passing day— I therefore continue  3. Reminiscences of Europe, from 1794 to 4 September 1801.— 1798.  Caillard-Syeyes. Inauguration of Frederic William 3. My wife’s severe illness— Summer journey to Brandenburg— Distressing incident— Treaty renewed for ten years. My brother Thomas leaves me— Thomas Welsh junr takes his place Excursion to Potsdam.— English at Berlin— 1799. Learning German. Wieland’s Oberon Summer journey to Toplitz—intermittent fever there— Coburg family there Count Golowkin— Month at Dresden— Elector of Saxony— Hugh Elliot English Minister Fortress of Königstein— Errington’s and other English— Gallery of Pictures— Italian opera— Return to Berlin— Count and Countess Brühl.

The newspapers from Boston, New-York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, report the Thermometers of Fahrenheit on Saturday last from 100 to 106 in the shade. In Boston and here a change of the wind to East about 1 O’Clock Sunday morning brought down my thermometer to 76, and the feeling of the whole day was rather cold than cool. This change did not occur so far South even as New-York, nor fifty miles westward in the interior. There the heat was intense throughout the day of Sunday as it had been the day before. Monday was the third day of intense heat to our Southern and western neighbours, mitigated here by a remnant of easterly wind till the thunder gust of the afternoon, much severer north of us than here— Yesterday was the fourth day of the spell, not at all refreshed by the thunder-gust of Monday afternoon— This day is the fifth made supportable by a Southwestern breeze. Charles and his sons have bathed every day at the lime-trees on Mount Wollaston beach. I suppressed my longing for a Sea bath till this evening after Sunset, when I rode in the Carryall with John Kirk and Arthur to the beach and took the bath— Charles and his three elder sons were there, but Arthur was afraid of the horseflies, and did not chuse to be ducked. It was half past 9 in the evening when we got home, and I shall not have passed the Summer without one Sea bath— The effect of the weather upon my body and mind is debilitating.— By an extraordinary effort I wrote a short Letter to Mr John Angier, and one to Mr Andrew Jackson Downing to thank him for his book on the fruits and fruit trees of America.  4.

                "text": "17. III.30. Thursday.  I had agreed with Mr Thomas Loring to go upon a fishing party to Cohasset this day— And to lose as little of it as possible I undertook to leave home at Sunrise, and to be at Mr Loring’s at half-past 5. instead of which it was near that when I started from my gate with Fuller and the barouche, and it was half past six when we got to Mr Loring’s— My Son went with me— Mr Loring had a company of visitors, men and women, two or three of the men only being of the fishing party. They took time to breakfast and it was 8 O’Clock when we reached the cold spring lodge at Cohasset.— I went immediately out from the rocks in a sail boat at first about 2 miles when we caught nothing but perhaps half a dozen dwarf mackrel, and I caught with my mackrel line one perch.— After waiting there nearly three hours I proposed going about 3 miles further out, which was done— Here there was a great plenty of fish—several fine cod were taken, and in the course of 20 minutes I drew up five large haddock— But by some caprice of the skipper instead of coming to anchor after drifting a short time he set the sail again, and went out about 2 miles further, where someone soon tired, and moved to return— The wind was off shore, and we had to beat back; and the boat was so leaky that the water rather gained upon her with one hand constantly bailing out— My Son, with a Mr Jarvis, Mr Carter, one Mr Lincoln, and two or three others whose names I could not catch were in the boat— We landed at the cold spring rocks before one O’Clock— We found Mr Richardson the clergyman, Mr Baker, Mr. Solomon Lincoln and sundry others at the lodge, and dined upon chowder, with lemonade, ice water and champagne— No other wine— After dinner, about 20 persons having filled the two tables there was conversation, till a gathering of dark clouds at the north and a low rumbling of distant thunder gave us warning to provide for a shelter— We took to our several vehicles— Mr Hudson the young man who painted my portrait last autumn, took a seat with us in the barouche from Hingham in the morning, but returned with Mr Loring. The main strength of the thunder gust passed of to the North, and we reached Mr Loring’s house about ten minutes before what there was of the squall exploded there.— Sundry peals of thunder, and a copious shower of half an hour, were succeeded by a calm evening, a clear sky and a bright moon— A large tea and evening party of Ladies and gentlemen, most of them strangers to me, at Mr Loring’s closed the day— As they went into supper I took French leave and with my Son returned to Quincy home. His wife had just left our house and had gone up the hill— I had anticipated that there would be a heavy thunder gust this day, and deem it a turn of good fortune that it came without disconcerting our sport or turning it to disaster— These annual fishing parties at Cohasset through Hingham, which I have attended twenty years or more are becoming burdensome to myself and to others— I must bid them farewell— Among Mr Loring’s evening company was miss Anna Thaxter, and a married Lady by the name of Howe, who told me she had often seen me when she was a child, being a daughter of the late Deacon Morrill of the first Congregational church Boston.

The spell of Summer heat is over, but my spell of Indolence and of self-reproach is unbroken— The Steamer Acadia, Captaindeparted last Wednesday from Boston for Liverpool and this morning the Steamer Britannia, Captain John Hewitt arrived, having left Liverpool on the 4th of this month— Louis M’Lane goes with his wife, one Son and 3 daughters to take the place of Edward Everett as Minister of the United States at the Court of Queen Victoria. M’Lane, originally from Delaware, and son of a distinguished and well rewarded military officer of the revolution, was named Louis, in glorification of Louis seize, being born at the moment when the American army in one tremendous chorus were shouting— “A Dauphin’s born, let Cannons roar, let trumpets rend the sky— All hail to Gallia’s king, Columbia’s great ally.[”] After the Revolution Allan M’Lane was a federalist of the hottest metal— Marshal of the District of Delaware under two appointments for 4 years, by Washington—who in the last days of his Presidency appointed him to the then permanent Office of Collector of the District of Delaware, and Inspector of the Port of Wilmington, which he held till Crawford, Secretary of the Treasury, wriggled through Congress a Law limiting the Commissions of revenue officers to 4. years, and contriving the limitation so that almost all the Commissions would expire, precisely at the time when Crawford expected to come in as President. Louis the Dauphin, had been bred a federalist as hot as his father, and was member of the house of Representatives from Delaware when the Presidential election of 1825 came into the house— His vote was the vote of a whole State; and he had sold it to Crawford I have no doubt for a pledge that in the event of his election—Allan should be renominated for his collectorship and inspectorship— But being afraid of my resentment he was constantly tampering with my friends for a pledge from me to the same effect. Jackson and Crawford were at swords points till my election, a few days after which Jackson paid a visit of peace to Crawford, whose party was thence forward transferred to Jackson Louis gave the vote of one of the four States for Crawford, and when his father had got by my nomination his reappointment, went quietly under the wings of Van Buren to Jackson— Four years after, Van Buren turned up Secretary of State and Louis the Dauphin Minister to Great-Britain under Jackson, and then they consummated that sacrifice of the colonial trade to propitiate the smile of George Canning to the democratic party of the spoils. Louis the dauphin is precisely the man to cower before the British Lion and to consummate another sacrifice— Morning visits from Mrs Beecher of Cincinnati, with her son in Law and daughter, Mr and Mrs Saffron, and Mrs White. In an excursion to look at my Washington beans in the lot below the Orchard North of the house, I met a wild Irish woman who came with a tub for water from the running brook. I attempted to hold a conversation with her but she could neither speak nor understand a word of English; nor I a word of her Gaelic. "

Peter 3.4.—[“]the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God, of great price.”—part only of the last clause of the verse— Mr Lunt’s purpose was to bring the principle pressure of his discourse to bear upon the idea of a meek and quiet spirit as an ornament of great price in the sight of God.— In the original Greek this word ornament is not in this verse— The first six verses of the chapter are addressed espesially to wives—commanding them in the most unqualified terms to be in subjection to their husbands; and with out directly interdicting the natural passion of the sex for ornament directs them to seek it in a meek and quiet Spirit which he declares to be of great price in the sight of God— Mr Lunt did not remark that the lesson taught by the apostle in this case is addressed exclusively to married women— The Spirit is no doubt equally precious in the sight of God, in either sex; but as an ornament, is more peculiarly the glory of married women— Mr Lunt took care not to confound meekness with meanness or pusillanimity, but said it was perfectly reconcileable with the spirit of command, of which he gave an example in the case of Moses— He commented also largely upon the Picture of the Madonna della Seggia of Raphael, for the union of exquisite beauty, extreme simplicity, destitute of all personal ornament, and maternal affection, all tenderness and love— I have seen some of these sentiments and opinions before, and Mr Lunt did not entirely fail to give credit for them— His afternoon text was Luke 17.25. [“]But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.”— On the progress of Christianity, of the Kingdom of God. There is variety of memorable matter in this chapter— Among them the incident of the miraculous cleansing of then lepers, while on his way to Jerusalem— Upon their appeal to him for Mercy, he only told them to go and shew themselves unto the Priests. That was the direction of the Levitical Law— They were all cleansed on their way to the Priests, but nine out of the ten forgot their benefactor, and one only, and he a Samaritan, alone returned to give glory to God— As I came out of Meeting this afternoon, my Son told me that Harvey Field had informed him that my woods on Pine hill were on fire; and that the fire had already covered about 30 acres of the ground— About Sunset, Fuller took Charles and me in the Carryall, to Charles Spear’s house. He was out at the Methodist meeting in his neighbourhood. We went there, and had him called out, and he went with us to the place where we were told that the fire had been—for it was said to be nearly or quite extinct. It was not on pine hill but on the adjoining lot of Lawyers common. I went upon the lot, but it was so dark that I could not trace the path to the spot where the fire still burnt, but my Son and Charles Spear did— They thought it confined to the low bough, and stumps of old fallen trees, and was subdued. Before we returned however we saw the flame rising from the tops of lofty trees— There is no water in the woods and no fire engine can reach them. We came home leaving the sequel to Providence "

O’Clock, and as soon as daylight came I saw from my Southern window volumes of smoke like light clouds rise and pass in the direction north-eastward from near the spot where we had found last evening the fire in the woods.— The Calamity of fire of which I now live in perpetual terror, has reached me—beginning with the woods— For many months not a day has passed without an alarm of fire in some one or more of our cities. Fires has become a standing Article of News in all our daily newspapers— Three times since the beginning of last Spring, my dwelling house at Washington has been in imminent danger of being burnt to the ground—twice actually on fire— I must yet rely on Providence— Tremendous fires within a few weeks have desolated the cities of Pittsburgh and Quebec, two in each city, and the newspapers of this morning recount the conflagration of 250 dwelling houses last Saturday in the city of New-York— To each his sufferings: all are men; condemn’d alike to moan; The tender for anothers pain; The unfeeling for his own— The heat of Summer still disables me—what I was doing all this day I am scarcely able to tell.

Towards evening I had visits from Mr Daniel Greenleaf 83 years of age, Mr Choules Pastor of a new baptist Church at Roxbury, and a boy of 12 or 14 a pupil of his from New-York named Hallet— I copied from last Saturday’s Boston Evening Gazette, at second hand from Blackwood four Stanzas upon the setting Sun— The first exquisitely beautiful— The rest common whining cant about the misery of human life. I received from Mr John Angier of Medford an answer to the Letter which I wrote him last week—with the Deed of Annuity in Trust from the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company of 2000 dollars for the late Mrs Angier; and a Statement of other items of her property for which he offers to hold himself accountable to her family; but with which I have no agency.— The Letter is highly honourable to him.  2.

I went this morning to Mrs Ann Adams’s, to converse with her and with her daughter Elizabeth, upon the disposal to be made of the proceeds from the annuity upon trust held of the Massachusetts hospital life insurance company for her eldest daughter Mrs Abby Smith Angier who died on the 4th. of last February.— By the terms of the investment, the property stood in my name subject to be withdrawn once at the end of every five years— Two of those terms had passed away, and the third was approaching when it was the intention of Mrs Angier as she informed me last autumn to have withdrawn the deposit— Upon her decease the amount due upon the deposit with the interest for one quarter subsequent to the decease was to be paid to me, my Executors or Administrators, without any direction how it is to be disposed of by me— Mrs Angier died without making any testamentary disposal of it— As I understand the Law, I am bound to pay the money over to him as his lawful property; but it was evidently her intention that in the event of her own decease it should revert to her family, and Mr Angier in his Letter to me proposes that it should be secured to Mrs Adams and her surviving daughter Elizabeth— Mrs Adams is in all probability on her death-bed— In the autumn of 1840. she underwent an operation to extirpate a cancer in the breast, but it has reopened soon after her daughter’s death, and she has been several months confined to her chamber, and almost entirely to her bed— I spoke first with Elizabeth and stated to her the substance of Mr Angier’s Letter to me. She was affected by it to tears— And Mrs Adams, was still more agitated by my statement— Both expressed the most grateful sensibility to the generosity and kindness of Mr Angier, and a disposition to acquiesce in Mr Angier’s disposal of the property— Mrs Adams requested my advice, which concurred with his suggestions—but we came to no definite conclusion— Mrs Adams said her sickness had drawn after it considerable expence, and she was in great want of money. My Son gave me to execute with my wife, a deed to the proprietors of the Old Colony Railroad, for land taken by them from the Faxon farm in Braintree which my brother Thomas conveyed to me in fee, but the title to which I hold in trust for his widow during her life, and for his surviving children after her decease.— They give 550 dollars for the land thus taken, which is to be paid over to Mrs. Adams. We executed the deeds which were attested by my Son and Mary E. E. Cutts. Mr John Cranch and his wife were here this evening with Lucy Dawes, a daughter of Mrs Lucy Dawes, eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs John Greenleaf.— Mr John Cranch is one of four surviving Sons of my cousin judge William Cranch. He is by profession a portrait painter but has not hitherto been successful in his business. He was married last Spring, and comes to try his fortune at Boston. "

Brooks’s Office, and invited him, and his Son Edward who was with him to dine with us at Quincy to-morrow. They both promised to come My next visit was to Mellen and Hopkins’s shop where they measured the height of Bates’s patent shower bath and found it 8 feet 3 inches; but it may be reduced to 7 feet 6. both too high for my chamber.— Then I went to Amory hall and gave a sitting of an hour to Mr King, for my bust. Thence I walked to the State house and attended a meeting of the board of Overseers of Harvard University in the Senate chamber. The time of meeting was 12 O’Clock, and I was punctually there to the minute. But it was near half an hour, before any other member came, and more than half an hour before the meeting was opened— Neither the Governor nor Lieutt Governor was there— Nor was President Quincy. Revd. Dr Pierce of Brookline the Secretary said that those Officers being absent the rule of the board was that the Senior member of the Executive Council present should preside. This was now Mr Samuel Hoar, who accordingly took the chair— The first communication was of the appointments to honorary degrees to be conferred at the approaching commencement— They were all referred to a Committee of 3 members to report at the adjourned meeting of the board on the 21st. of next month at 1/2 past 12. O’Clock at the Senate chamber.— The next Communication from the Corporation was that Josiah Quincy had resigned the Office of President of the University. That they had accepted his resignation and asked leave of the Overseers to elect a President in his place. There was an honorary resolution of the Corporation, accompanying that of the acceptance of his resignation— A vote was immediately taken confirming the acceptance of Mr Quincy’s resignation— After which Mr John C. Gray—enquired if it was not usual for the board of Overseers on accepting the resignation of the President to pass some resolution expressive of their sense of the services of the retiring officer— It was suggested that it would be necessary to reconsider the acceptance of the resignation, before acting upon Mr Gray’s enquiry, and he made a motion to that effect, and that a Committee of 3 be appointed by the chairman to consider and report upon the whole subject at the adjourned meeting— I observed that there seemed to be no need of reconsidering the acceptance of the resignation but the appointment of the committee to report at the adjourned meeting. Mr Gray modified his resolution accordingly which was adopted and the Chairman appointed me, Daniel A. White and Samuel H. Walley jr. the Committee— They agreed to meet me on the day of the adjournment at the Senate chamber, an hour before the meeting of the board. "

O’Clock at the Senate chamber.— The next Communication from the Corporation was that Josiah Quincy had resigned the Office of President of the University. That they had accepted his resignation and asked leave of the Overseers to elect a President in his place. There was an honorary resolution of the Corporation, accompanying that of the acceptance of his resignation— A vote was immediately taken confirming the acceptance of Mr Quincy’s resignation— After which Mr John C. Gray—enquired if it was not usual for the board of Overseers on accepting the resignation of the President to pass some resolution expressive of their sense of the services of the retiring officer— It was suggested that it would be necessary to reconsider the acceptance of the resignation, before acting upon Mr Gray’s enquiry, and he made a motion to that effect, and that a Committee of 3 be appointed by the chairman to consider and report upon the whole subject at the adjourned meeting— I observed that there seemed to be no need of reconsidering the acceptance of the resignation but the appointment of the committee to report at the adjourned meeting. Mr Gray modified his resolution accordingly which was adopted and the Chairman appointed me, Daniel A. White and Samuel H. Walley jr. the Committee— They agreed to meet me on the day of the adjournment at the Senate chamber, an hour before the meeting of the board. "

Foster’s house where I found Fuller with the Barouche, and the Ladies my companions, and we returned to Quincy before dinner.— I dined at my Son’s house with Mr Peter C. Brooks and his Son Gorham who brought with him his son Shepard, a boy 5 or 6 years old— Mrs Gorham Brooks once Ellen Shepard was to have been of the party, but was taken ill last night and could not come— Mr Peter C. Brooks came to spend a couple of days with his daughter Charles’s wife. Mr Gorham Brooks returned with his Son to Medford this evening. I urged him to come out again and dine with us to-morrow, which he almost promised. After dinner yesterday, I took a walk with Mr P. C. Brooks and Charles to the summit of that most beautiful hill, on the side of which Charles’s house stands. Charles came down in the Evening. Mr Brooks spent it with his daughter.— This forenoon with Mr Brooks and my Son I took a ride to mount Wollaston.— We rode down to the strand of the Creek, alighted between it, and the old John Quincy house—and ascended to the top of Mare-mount— We rode also down to the extremity of Hough’s neck Mr Brooks, with Charles and his wife, Mr Edward Brooks and Dr Frothingham dined with us— The two last having come out from Boston for the purpose.— I had met Dr Frothingham yesterday at the Overseer’s meeting and then invited him. After dinner Charles’s sons Charles Francis, Henry Brooks, and Arthur were here and the infant daughter with her nurse;—the child was born on the 18th. of last February, and had not yet been christened— Suddenly this afternoon, the fancy came to her mother to have her now baptized, which ceremony was accordingly performed by the Revd. Dr. Frothingham— The delay hitherto has been occasioned by indecision upon the point of the name to be given to the child, which was finally determined to be Mary— All the domestics of both families, were called in to be present, and Dr Frothingham performed the ceremony with great and affecting solemnity according to the forms of the congregational churches, without godfather or godmother or sign of the cross— Dr Frothingham and Mr Edward Brooks returned this evening to Boston, and the latter to Cambridge, his Summer residence. Mr Peter C. Brooks, with Charles and his wife went up the hill and passed the evening there— As a Justice of Peace throughout the Commonwealth he took my acknowledgment of the Deed to the proprietors of the Old Colony Railroad, of the strip of land taken from the Faxon farm.

A Merciful Providence has hitherto conducted us along the path of life— We have enjoyed much— We have suffered not a little— Good and Evil have followed us alternately— The thread has been of checkered yarn. Altogether my lot has been a happy one upon Earth, and every feeling of my heart ought to be a sentiment of Gratitude to him who is the disposer of events— I have met with bitter disappointments— Heavy calamities have befallen me— All my children with one exception have been taken from me— One in infancy—two in the prime of life, and this bereavement has once been extended to the second generation— The successive decease of my brother Charles, of my Sister, of my mother of my father and of my brother Thomas, have for the last thirteen years left me the only member of the family of the past and the present generation, surviving on this earth— The common them of reason is death of fathers, and it is one of the fatalities of old age, to follow to the tomb all the joys of cotemporary kindred and friendship.  With regard to what is called, the wheel of Fortune, my career in life has been with severe vicissitudes, on the whole highly auspicious. With advantages of education perhaps unparalleled, with principles of integrity, of benevolence, of industry and frugality, and the lofty Spirit of patriotism and Independence taught me from the cradle, with the love of Letters and the arts useful and ornamental, and with aspirations of Science, limited only by the scanty spark of ethereal fire in the soul, my intercourse with my cotemporaries, has in all its fluctuations been more successful than I deserved— My life has been spent in the public service— Washington, Madison, Monroe were my friends and benefactors— Jefferson a hollow and treacherous friend.— Jackson, Charles J. Ingersoll, George W. Erving, Jonathan Russell, base, malignant and lying enemies, a list to which I might, but will not add other names.— I have enjoyed a portion of the favour of my country at least equal to my desert, but have suffered and yet suffer much from that Slander which outvenoms all the worms of Nile— But I am wandering from my wedding day.— Mr Peter C. Brooks went with Charles to Boston; upon his return home to Medford—and Charles brought his son John Quincy home from School— Mr Loring brought me from Hingham a basket of harvest apples. Miss Smith a daughter of Mr Richard Smith of Philadelphia was with him. Mrs. Martha Burrill a claimant of a widows pension came and left her papers with me— I found her name upon the list of pensioners in the Session Message of 1840.— Mr Longworth of Cincinnati sent me from Boston an engraved portrait of Hiram Powers the Sculptor in profile. I received also a Letter from Mr Serruys the Chargé d’Affaires from Belgium "

                "text": "27. II.55 Sunday.  A very young man by the name of Appleton, a son of Nathaniel Appleton of Dorchester, and grandson of Dr Appleton of Boston whom I knew as a member of the Wednesday evening club in 1790, and who died of consumption between that and 1794. was the preacher this day— His morning text was 2. Peter. 1.19. [“]We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts”— The discourse and the whole service were unusually short. Mr Appleton has but just begun to preach, and has not yet learned to be long winded.— He gave notice that the Communion would be administered the next Lord’s day. He walked home and dined with us— It began to rain all this morning, and continued till half way between noon and Sunset, with a Southeast veering to a Northeast wind, and then cleared up cold. Coll. Paul Anderson of Cincinnati Ohio came out from Boston, with a boy of 13 named Straiter, his travelling companion. He attended the Meeting, morning and afternoon—dined with my Son, and took tea with us— Mr Appleton’s afternoon service was as short as that of the morning— His text was Luke 9.23. [“]And he said to them all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.”— Mr Appleton’s father is a brother of Mr William Appleton of this town— Another brother resided at Baltimore, named Charles father of John Cranch’s wife— Coll. Anderson left us after tea and returned to Boston. This Gentleman was a member of the Committee of the Astronomical Society at Cincinnati appointed for the arrangements of my reception—and he accompanied me in the Steamer from Cincinnati as far as Portsmouth Ohio, on my way to Pittsburgh. It had escaped my recollection; the multitude of persons from whom I received extraordinary civilities on that journey was so great that I have not retained all their names.— Coll. Anderson reminded me of his tour with me, and I find it exactly noted in my journal of the time. He was also very obliging in his attentions to my Son, and Josiah Quincy junr when they were at Cincinnati on their Western tour in May 1844.— He is a very favourable sample of the Western Pioneer, and speaks in the most exalted terms of Tom Corwin, and Robert Schenk— Passed Midshipman John Quincy Adams 2d. with Charles and his wife spent the evening with us— My visitors engrossed the day so that I had no time left for the usual reading of the day— I made no progress in Swedenborg’s Heaven and Hell— There is something so inexpressibly absurd in this book that I can never think without amazement of the fact that its author is the founder of a religious sect and that multitudes of respectable, intelligent men believe in his pretended supernatural intercourse with angels— The system appears to consist of the doctrine of correspondences, which might with more propriety be called analogies. “As all things which are according to divine order, correspond to Heaven, so all things which are contrary to divine order correspond to hell. The things which correspond to heaven all have relation to good and truth; those which correspond to hell, to evil and the false.” The two Althaea trees in front of the Southern and Eastern door of my house began to blossom yesterday, the anniversary of my wedding day. This is a pleasant and a cheering correspondence. "

Monday  Charles went to Boston this morning and brought out with him his son John Quincy, at whose school a vacation of six weeks is commencing— Mr Thomas Greenleaf and Mr Beale called on me as members of the Adams Temple and School fund Corporation, with a proposition from the proprietors of the Old Colony Railroad to purchase part of the lot given by my father to the town of Quincy.— They had the plan of the lot with them, and pointed to the spot where the proprietors of the Rail-road wish to cut in— They thought it would be an advantage to the remainder of the lot to comply with this proposal— I agreed to inspect the ground and examine the plan on the spot. And to call a meeting of the Trustees of the fund to decide upon it. I received from Professor James Walker of Cambridge, a Letter with two Newspapers containing the resignation on the 19th. of March last by Josiah Quincy of his Office as President of Harvard University, which he has held and illustrated the last 16 years; and the proceedings of the Corporation, on that event.— I wanted them for the use of the Committee of the board of Overseers appointed at their last meeting to report at the adjourned meeting on the 21st. of August, and professor Walker had promised to send them to me. I received also from Mr Henry Gassett, a 4to. volume, being the Constitutions of the antient and honorable fraternity of free and accepted Masons compiled by my old friend and classmate Thaddeus Mason Harris, published in 1798, then chaplain to the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts— And with it a newspaper, the Boston daily journal of the 23d instt. containing an account of the laying of the corner stone of a new college chapel at Brunswick in the State of Maine—which ceremony was performed by the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of the State of Maine—much to the annoyance of Mr Gassett.— I disposed this day of the remaining first fruits of my mazzard cherry trees raised from the stone of which there are three in the garden now first come into considerable bearing. The fruit of two of the trees ripened from the 4th. to the 11th. of this month that of the third standing at the kitchen garden gate, and overshadowed by a white mulberry tree was scarcely ripe on the 22d. when gathered— I have steeped these cherries in French Brandy, in Jamaica and in New England rum for comparison of their qualities, and I this day steeped 100 in each of 3 half bottles of each of those spiritous liquors, to close the experiment— Of the rest I planted 5 rows of 10 stones each, behind the tool shed in the garden, 6 in the shade of the horse-chesnut tree next to our North-eastern gate, and others at random.—  3. Reminiscences of America from 4. September 1801. to 5. August 1809.  1803. Senate of Massachusetts— Boston Bank.

I went to the Quincy Stone Bank, and deposited there the check on Columbian Bank, Boston payable to me or bearer 2962:96. which I received at the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Office for the annuity in trust of the late Mrs Angier, and drew a check on the Quincy Bank payable to John Angier or order, which I enclosed in a Letter to Mr Angier, and for which I requested of him a receipt. This transaction has exercised my discursive faculties with many reflections, upon the nature, obligations and responsibilities of trusts. Mrs Angier a few days before she was married invested 2000 dollars in this company, for an annuity, of which I was the trustee— I understood that nothing was desired of me, but the use of my name. A few days after the execution of the deed, my niece was married— The deed was delivered to her husband Mr Angier, and I kept no voucher to shew that I had any agency or interest in the whole concern. For seven years till 1838. Mr Angier received the annual interest on the investment; but from that time no interest has been drawn and the principal has increased to near 3000 dollars— She never had a child— Last autumn it was her intention to withdraw the money at the expiration of the third term of 5 years from its investment and make other disposal of it— She died without leaving a Will, or any direction concerning it— The final provision of the Deed of trust was that in the event of her decease the whole amount should be paid to me, my Executors, or Administrators, without any direction what to do with the money. By the revised Statutes of Massachusetts Part 2. Title 2 Chap. 61. Section 1. Rule 3. and Chap. 64. Section 1. Rule 4. The husband is by law entitled to the whole sum—though but for him, it would go in equal portions to the mother and surviving brothers and sister.— Mr Angier’s Letter to me suggests the wish to divide it between Mrs Angier’s mother and her sister Elizabeth.— But it was doubtful whether Mrs. Ann Adams the mother would survive this day— She will probably not survive the week, and her death would raise new questions.— On full reflection I deemed my duty clear to pay the money to Mr Angier— I accordingly wrote to him, and enclosed the check on the Quincy Stone bank, payable to him or his Order— The check on Columbian Bank was payable to me or bearer— Could I by endorsement make it payable to order? a Question.— Payable to me, or bearer, sent by mail; liable to accident, it might fall into other hands, and bear record of payment to me, but not by me. My deposit and check on the Quincy Stone bank—makes it a record of payment by me to Mr Angier, and if in transit, it should fall into other hands it will be payable only by Mr Angier’s endorsement— These are my reasons for the mode of the transaction— Mr Alexander S. Johnson of New-York came this day to visit us, and Midshipman John Wilkes junr Son of Commander Charles Wilkes was here at tea— My wife passed the day at Mrs Ann Adams’s, whose disease is rapidly drawing to a fatal termination. At her urgent request my wife after coming home late in the afternoon returned there again between 9 and 10. at Night, but finding her somewhat relieved from her agony, and with a prospect of a more quiet Night, she came home again— Mrs Adams’s Sisters, Mrs Greenough and Mrs Stebbins, her daughter, and her Son John Quincy are with her.

He teaches a school at Epping New Hampshire, and occasionally officiates as a Free will Baptist preacher— He brought me a Letter of Introduction from my friend William Plumer junr of Epping, but said his only object in visiting me was to take advantage of the vacation at his school to see me, before I go hence, which could not be remote; and he wished also to inspect my farm. He said he had always since he came to this Country taken much interest in me and my public career; because he had learnt that I had resided heretofore in his native country—to which he still felt a strong attachment, although from long absence, he had lost the use of his native language and spoke nothing but English— I continue my plantations of mazzard cherry stones, for the chance of raising stocks, and I this day gathered a plum from the tree near the Summer house cellar, proceeding from a stone of those that I brought from the Garden of the President’s house at Washington in 1828— This tree bore half a dozen plums two years ago— It was in full and profuse blossom when I came here last May— It has now ten or twelve plums ripening on it, and I gathered one full sized, and of deep crimson colour, though yet hard, to save it from pillagers, and fix the time of its ripening in this climate— Smitten in conscience by my waste of time I resumed this afternoon my design to collect and have bound in volumes as a gift to my Son, all my miscellaneous writings which have been printed in 8vo. pamphlets— I began this collection three or four years ago, and have postponed the binding of the volumes from year to year to make it if possible complete— I expected to make it of 3 volumes, and have two or three times prepared indexes for them; but have still hunted up additional publications till they will now make 5. large volumes, so that the indexes are all to be made over again— They are still incomplete and I have shrunk from the repetition of ineffectual labour— At length I have resolved no longer to delay the execution of my purpose, lest I should be taken from it unachieved— I made out this afternoon a final index to Vol. 1. and spent three hours in overhauling old printed documents to find if possible two or three yet missing, altogether without success— But I take consolation in having made this collection so nearly complete, which will of itself be almost equivalent to an autobiography, from 4 July 1793. when I delivered the Boston town Oration, till my address to my Constituents 3. April 1845— The papers of Marcellus and of Publicola, Columbus and Barneveld, the Report to the Senate in the case of John Smith of Ohio, and sundry trifles in prose and verse will yet be missing, but will not be missed, and a list of them may be made by myself from memory, and minuted in a supplementary volume; if I should be able to collect one There must be no more delay— “Le Mieux est l’Ennemi du Bien.” "

They alighted at Chandler and Greenleaf’s shop and I after depositing my documents at the Historical Society’s chambers, and stopping to pay a provision bill at Seaverns’s shop gave the 4th. sitting of an hour to the Sculptor, Mr King.

The recording Secretary was likewise absent andPage was chosen Secretary for the Meeting. I presented the Annual Congressional Document, on the Commerce and Navigation of the United States for the last ten years, from 1835 to 1844 inclusive; for the recorded minute of which I had written a Letter to President Savage which was read— There was a donation in pamphlet form of a document printed in a newspaper, pasted on leaves of 8vo. size, the original being a manuscript belonging to the Society; which Mr Thornton had borrowed, and taken and had printed in the newspaper which he presented without leave obtained of the Society— There was much question on whether this present should be accepted and several members denied the right and the propriety of publishing in newspapers, manuscripts belonging to the Society, without their permission— The whole subject was finally referred to the publishing committee with instructions to present for consideration some rule or regulation against the publication, in newspapers without leave, manuscripts borrowed from the Society— I proposed that the publishing Committee should consider the expediency of having one of the well painted Portraits belonging to the Society handsomely engraved, and inserted with a short Memoir of the person in every successive volume published by the Society. Some objection was made on account of the expence—but the proposal was on the whole well received—and it was agreed that the Committee should take it into consideration— The meeting was adjourned to Tuesday the 26th. of August— I called at the shop of Mellen and Hopkins at the corner of Ann and Union Streets and bespoke one of Bates’s Shower baths. Then took up my companion young Ladies and returned home to Quincy to dine. After dinner a young man from Roxbury named Torrey, brought me a Letter of Introduction from Samuel H.

Set 7:20—  The Steamship Britannica Captain John Hewett left the wharf at East Boston this afternoon with 48 passengers for Halifax and Liverpool— One the 16th. of last June I dined with my Son upon the hill, and after dinner, from his eastern windows we saw the Steamer Cambria, Captain Judkins start from he moorings, and pass rapidly out of Boston harbour to Sea— She arrived at Liverpool on the 27th. of June after a passage of 11 days andhours—the shortest passage ever made between the two Ports— She left Liverpool again on the 19th. and arrived at the East-Boston wharf on the 30th of July in 11 days andhours—the shortest passage westward between the two ports ever made—touching on both passages at Halifax— My Son with his two boys John and Charles, and Mr Alexander S. Johnson went on a fishing party to Cohassett and returned about 5 this afternoon— Mr Charles Ewer was here again this morning and took my answer of acceptance to the election as an honorary member of the Massachusetts Historic Genealogical Society. I had received at Washington last February a Letter from Samuel G Drake Corresponding Secretary of that Society informing me of this election, which I had not found time to answer, and which I had forgotten, till meeting this Mr Ewer last week in the Street in Boston, he accosted me and reminded me of it— Mrs Martha Burrill was here again with her little Grandchild daughter of Richard Newcomb— I had read her papers consisting only of Letters from her husband Lemuel Burrill a Seaman on board the frigate Macedonian in 1822.— She says it was on these papers that she obtained the pension of 6 dollars a month which she received for 5 years from 1837 to 1842— The act of Congress of 3. March last continues these pensions for 5 years longer, but hers has been stop’d she knows not why.— I promised to send her papers to the Commissioner of Pensions and to request of him a new pension certificate for her— I had to answer a Letter from Mr Charles Serruys, the Chargé d’Affaires from Belgium informing me of his removal from his Mission here to the Court of Hanover, and reminding me of a promise which I had repeatedly made to him of an autograph of my father. I found after a considerable search this day an autograph Letter of 22. April 1782. written at Amsterdam to John Bondfield and enclose that in my answer to Mr Serruys— Two tedious hours this afternoon in the never-ending vexation of overhauling old congressional documents without one discovery to my purpose— While I was thus engaged Mrs Josiah Quincy and Mrs Boyd paid visits to my wife, but I returned to the house too late to greet them— I made up a final index to the second volume of the collection of my miscellaneous writings for my Son— Mrs Ann Adams continues at the last extremity, between insensibility and the last Agony "

The weather for the last two days has been such as might have been enjoyed in the garden of Eden before the fall— But nothing can a charm impart to the decays of age—and symptoms of bodily disease, disclose themselves day after day of which it is useless to speak and idle to complain; but which I ought to take and improve as warnings to set my house in order— Among these is increasing insomnia— I lead a very regular life, wasting some hours for exercise every day, and retiring regularly to bed between 10 and 11 at Night— But I seldom sleep 3 hours often lying hours before sleep comes and often awaking before 2. with inability to sleep again, and irresistible impatience to rise— Last Night I lay consciously awake the whole Night. Hearing the entry clock strike 11. and 12. but not 1. 2 or 3—waiting nearly an hour to hear it strike one—finally rising from inability to wait longer and finding it daylight and close upon four— I had thus slept nearly 3 hours, all the time believing myself awake— A consequence of this is, dosing all the day long, and mental imbecility— I wrote to George H Colton of New-York, and to redeem arrears of Correspondence resolved to write at least one short Letter every day through this month— Pursuing the double purpose of making a collection of my pamphlet published writings, to be bound in volumes for my Son, and of assorting other pamphlets for the book binder I ransacked many hundreds of old pamphlets till it was a weariness to the flesh—and made the index to the third volume of the compilation for my Son. There is mixed up in this assemblage of my writings much—perhaps two thirds of the whole, written by others—especially the controversies and the negotiations— Of these I daily find additional pamphlets, containing perhaps only one or two Letters of mine, with all the rest of the pamphlet by others.— I think of forming a secondary or supplementary collection for my Son— My plan enlarges as I proceed— I must take care not to let it spread to evaporation.  4.

                "text": "3. III.20. Sunday—  Communion day  Mr Lunt preached this morning, from John 17.4. “I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.” An occasional Discourse, preliminary to the administration of the communion— The words of the text are part of the last discourse held by Jesus after his last Supper, and immediately before he went forth to the garden, where he was betrayed by Judas and taken.— The narrative by John is extended from the 13th. to the 17th. chapter inclusive— The institution of the eucharist or Lord’s supper is not noticed in these chapters, nor any where in the gospel of John— It is related by the three other Evangelists, only one of whom, Matthew, introduces the words “for the remission of sins,[”] of which Dr Pusey makes such preposterous use— The discourse of Jesus in these chapters of John, is different from the relations of the other three— The ceremony of the communion is performed with solemnity partaking of awfulness by almost every denomination of Christians—but the frequent repetition of it always in the same words, and with the same action makes it scarcely possible to retain the profound impression with which it is first gone through. Mr Lunt’s Sermon was an earnest exposition of the declaration of Jesus at his last hour that he had glorified his father on the earth, and had finished the work which his father had given him to do.— Mr Lunt’s text in the afternoon was from John 16.33. [“]These things I have spoken to you, that in me, ye might have peace,” omitting the remainder of the verse— [“]In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” The tenor of the discourse was an argument upon the natural aspirations of human nature to the enjoyment of Peace of Mind, and upon the peculiar adaptation to that end of the system of Christianity— Peace of mind is indeed the greatest of earthly blessings, and if the mission of Jesus Christ had been exclusively to secure the enjoyment of that blessing to his followers, it would have been worthy of a supernatural revelation from Heaven.— In parting from his disciples Jesus tells them in the world they shall have tribulation. But bids them be of good cheer—for he has overcome the world— Peace of Mind was the Supreme good of the Epicurean Philosophy, but they held it resolvable into sensual enjoyment— Philosophy teaches us to bear with composure the ills of Life which we cannot avert— Religion teaches us to bear them with Fortitude and cheerfulness. Enthusiasm, like the doctrine of the Stoics attempt, to disguise them and to deny that they are evils— I cannot subscribe to this creed either philosophical or religious— The approach of death is little compatible with Peace of mind— I have it now before me day and Night. The administration of the communion is a suitable occasion for habituating the Soul to endurance. Mr Lunts prayer had manifest and pathetic allusion to the condition of Mrs Ann Adams, still lingering with life. "

                "text": "5 III.15 Tuesday.  Sun rose 4.56— Set 7.15  Mr Simeon Cary is a native of North Bridgwater whose residence for the last 30. years has been, at Gardner in the State of Maine— He is now on a visit to sundry of his relatives in the town where he was born, and calls to see me for curiosity and for old acquaintance sake— In the Summers of 1805—and to when I dwelt at the foot of Penn’s hill, a trying period of my life which I am just now reviewing in Memory he was in the habit of attending every week in early morning the Boston market with butchers meat, fowls, and occasionally wild ducks, pigeons or partridges.— He says he then often met, me at my gate, and supplied me with provisions for my family.— I well remember being thus supplied by several frequenters of the market, but have no special personal remembrance of him— He says he has been reasonably prosperous in his settlement at Gardner and has a family of children with whom he lives comfortably— Mr M’Culloch is a native of Cincinnati, Ohio 33 years of age. He came while we were at dinner. He said he had seen me at Cincinnati in November 1843. and he brought with him the first volume of my mother’s and the first volume of my fathers Letters published by my Son, and requested me to write my name in each of them for an Autograph, which I accordingly did.— He returned to Boston in a Carryall of Gillets with Alexander Smith Johnson, who after a visit of a week left us to return to New-York— This is the second family visit from Alexander S. Johnson, since mine to Utica in July 1843. I invited him earnestly to come again, and I should take great delight in keeping up the most cordial intercourse with the descendants of my brother Charles— This young man began his career in New-York under promising auspices.— I hope they may not end in disappointment— Excepting the time that I borrowed this day for exercise, it was occupied with steady assiduity, yet without accomplishing my daily task— I answered a Letter from John A. Peters in behalf of the Managers of the Lyceum at Bangor, inviting me to deliver a Lecture before them in the course of the ensuing autumn— I decline, and must henceforth decline all such invitations.— I cannot sufficiently stamp it upon my will that the short remnant of my life should be exclusively devoted to preparation for my departure— Meantime Kirke has trim’d off the parts of stocks over the bud stems of the apple-tree fronting my South-eastern Library window, one in Mary Louisa’s patch, and one in that of my dear departed Fanny—and one Bartlet pear-bud at the eastern end of the Seminary— I had an empty Champagne box, filled with loose earth and placed in a corner of the Seminary, to try the experiment of sowing Washington Plum-stones, Mazzard Cherry Stones, English White Oak Acorns, and Shagbark walnuts for next Spring and Summer.— And with the aid of Kirke, I found five plums still left ripe on the Washington Plum tree— My reminiscences of the year 1805 minuted on the last page gave me while I was recalling them many a heart ache. There were some that I have not the heart to record. "

                "text": "6. III.30 Wednesday  Sun rose 4:57. Set 7.14  My Son with his wife, his third Son Henry Brooks and the infant daughter Mary and her nurse, and my grand daughter Mary-Louisa, left us this day for an excursion of a week, to Lenox, to see his eldest daughter Louisa-Catherine, who is at school at Mrs. Charles Sedgwick’s and to visit Lebanon Springs— He went into Boston early this morning. Fuller took the rest of them to Boston in our Carriage at 2. O’Clock P.M. As they were departing from our gate, Mr William Plumer junr of Epping New Hampshire came in from Gillet’s Noon Stage, dined with us, and returned to Boston in Gillet’s 3. O’Clock Stage. I received on the 11th. of last month a Letter from this gentleman dated 2. days before at Epping, disclosing the expectation of being soon called upon to publish a Memoir of his father’s life he being in his 89th. year with his health and memory much impaired— From the 21st. of October 1803 to the 3d. of March 1807. I sat in the Senate of the United States side by side with Mr Plumer the father, and during the latter part of that time in very intimate relations with him— His political opinions during that period coincided more with mine than those of any other public man of considerable distinction in the Country— I was in correspondence with him during my missions in Europe from 1809 to 1817. and for several years after my return home— In 1821. as an Elector of President and Vice-President of the United States he gave his solitary vote for me as President, and he has retained his personal kindness for me to this day— In my controversy with certain Boston federalists in 1829. he stood by me with unshaken fidelity and confirmed with unfaltering integrity my testimony with his own. Mr Plumer the Son was from 1806. to 1809. one of my pupils at Harvard University. While I was Secretary of State he was several years a member of Congress from New Hampshire, and has been in frequent correspondence with me from that time to this— Men of purer minds and more genuine patriotism exist not upon earth. I hope and trust that in the review of my life, for more than forty years, I may find some materials for the projected memoir of this pious and dutiful Son, which may be creditable to the reputation both of him and of his father; and that I shall on no earthly consideration flinch from the performance of the task— This was a sultry and oppressive Summer day somewhat saddened by fears of lurking night robbers round the house— Suspicions roused by the tintamare of Carbo the watch dog during the night which did not wake me from sleep, but which alarmed all the rest of the family. The dog was missing this morning but returned home this afternoon— I sent to Boston for Bates’s Chamber Shower Bath, which was brought out this day, and I had it set up in the eastern cellar of the house— None of the rooms in the house being high enough for its operation— I have been obliged to abandon the usage of Sea and river bathing which for so many years I considered a necessary of life.— The Shower bath is the only substitute left me, and I pine in longing for it— I saw the Sun rise and set from up the hill.

                "text": "7. III.30. Thursday.  Morning fog— Warm day— Clear Sunset  I made my first experiment of Bates’s patent chamber shower bath, and imagined that its immediate effect was a sensible improvement of my health— The shock of the shower bath stimulates perspiration. The human body is a colander always emitting humours which if arrested on their passage are turned inward and prey upon the vitals. To this cause I attribute most of the diseases that I have ever suffered, and to my Sea and river bathing and swimming I ascribe much of the health that I have enjoyed, and many years of life not yet extinct— Mr Warren, late a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in this Commonwealth, now a Counsellor at Law, practising in Boston, with Mr Ogden of New-Orleans, called on me this morning on their way to visit Mr Daniel Webster at Marshfield— Mr Ogden said he should come to visit me again, with his wife who came with him from New-Orleans, and whom he left this morning at Boston; his visit to Mr Webster being upon business— Mr Warren told me that he possessed a Letter from my father to his grandfather General James Warren written the day after the destruction of the tea in Boston in 1773. and giving his opinions at the time on that transaction. I asked him for a copy of that Letter which he promised to send me.— He said he had also a ring given as I understood him to his grandmother Mrs Mercy Warren by my mother in 1811. and bearing the initials of my father and mother— Upon this I must see him again— Mr Minott Thayer was also a visitor this day, with a nephew whom he introduced to me, as the Son of Nathaniel Thayer. Doctor Nathaniel Miller of Franklin, and his wife accompanied Mr Thayer.— Miss Smith says that Dr Miller is an eminent Surgeon, but I never had heard of him before— I received by the mail this morning a copy of the 2d. edition of the pamphlet of Thomas Falconer on the Oregon Question dated Putney 5. May 1845. directed to me in the same hand-writing as the first edition had been— I suppose like that, forwarded by Charles Sumner This is a topic on which I ought not to remain silent, and am not prepared to speak—but I have another and more urgent call—exceedingly perplexing— A Letter from Nicholas Murray, dated Elizabethtown N.J. 4. Augt. 1845 says— “I address you as the chairman of a Committee consisting of Governor Pennington, the Revd Dr Magee, and myself. This Community is about to erect a monument to the memory of the Revd James Caldwell with whose revolutionary services and tragical end you are doubtless familiar. It is to be erected on the 24th day of Novr. next, which will be the 64th anniversary of the day of his death. And the Com. and the Community at once look to you to make the address on the occasion.”— Can I refuse to comply with this invitation? Can I hesitate to accept it? Can I perform the task to the satisfaction of those who would assign it, and without discredit to myself? The last is the harrowing question. My destiny pursues me, and I must rely come weal come woe upon merciful dispensations and support from above— Mr Murray says he is the successor of Caldwell in the pastoral care of the 1st. Presbyterian church of Elizabethtown— I began this day but could not finish a genealogical Letter, concerning the descendants of Thomas Shepard in answer to enquiries of L. Manlius Boltwood of Andover. "

The weather continues hot and dry; and vegetation is turning buff coloured at the root for very thirst—I took my second shower bath this morning, and added to it the exercise of hoeing up weeds in the Seminary. Mr Beale called on me this afternoon, and spoke with me again about the patch of land upon the 8 acre lot given by my father to the town of Quincy—and of which the proprietors of the Old Colony Railroad want to purchase a small fragment of a few rods— They have already carried their road through the centre of the lot, and are bound to build a bridge over it for the accommodation of Mr Lemuel Bracket’s adjoining land— I told Mr Beale that I had not yet found time to examine with my Son, the ground on the spot, but I had a sufficiently correct idea of it to acquiesce in any cession of it which he would approve.— He said Mr Bracket had spoken of it to him this morning— And the object of it was to accommodate him— He thought the proprietors of the Railroad ought to give 3 or 400 dollars for it— Mr Beale when he came with Mr Thomas Greenleaf, about the proposals of the Railway proprietors to purchase, had named 5 or 600 dollars as the sum probably to be obtained, and I thought a descent to 3 or 400 ominous. I said therefore that 500 dollars should be demanded, to which he assented.— Mr Beale spoke of the bright star that he had seen in the East, several Evenings recently about 9. O’Clock, and said that he had never seen any thing so brilliant in the heavens. It is the Planet Mars, and has been noticed in the daily newspapers.— I have at length completed my collection, and indexes for five volumes of my writings heretofore published in 8vo. form, and which I intend, to give to my Son.— I finished also a genealogical Letter to L. Manlius Boltwood  6. Reminiscences of America, from 4. September 1801. to 5. August 1809.  1806— New-year’s visit to President Jefferson— Tunisian Ambassador—forty Indians.

I returned to Amory Hall and sat an hour to Mr King the Sculptor and then went to the rooms of the horticultural Society to see the exhibition of flowers and fruits— The flowers were very numerous and made up in bouquets with elegant taste, and there were apples, pears, plums peaches, Apricots, nectarines, currants, rasberries and figs. I saw no melons, oranges or pineapples— I bought one dozen of peaches, and brought them home— Met at the Rooms Mr Daniel P. Parker, Benjamin V. French and Harrison G. Otis— I took up Miss Smith at Mr Fosters, and we returned to Quincy to dine— Met here Mr Calvin Colton, who came from New-York to visit me— After dinner I had a long conversation with him, and he promised to dine with me to-morrow. Mr Waterston was here and delivered me a packet from President Quincy. "

While the second morning bell was ringing, I went to Mr French’s tavern, and enquired for Mr Colton who came down immediately from his chamber, and went with me to the Stone temple opposite, and, after inspecting the monument of my father and mother of the inscription upon which he asked me for a copy, he took a seat with me in my pew— Mr Samuel K. Lothrop preached, from 2 Corinthians 4.18. [“]While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things that are not seen.”— the remainder of the verse is—[“]for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.—” This was omitted from the text, but the whole discourse was a parallel in contrast between external and visible nature, and the internal empire of the soul—between every thing temporary and perishable, and every thing spiritual permanent and immortal.— The text and the chapter are portions of an argument to enforce the doctrine of the immortality of the Soul, as the special object and purpose of the Christian dispensation— There are intimations not very distinct but obscurely given out that he is enduring persecution, and threatened with the loss of his life for preaching this doctrine— What then? he substantially says— We believe, and therefore speak— The outward man may perish, but the inward man is renewed day by day.— You see the body—but it will vanish. It is temporal. It must pass away— You cannot see the Soul— It is of the things which are not seen—but it is eternal. It shall never die.— Look not then at the things which are seen— At the things of a day— Of an hour— Look at the things which are not seen. They are eternal— The naked precept without the context has the appears an inconsistency—an absurdity—and the disciple might reply in the words of MacFingal— But optics sharp it needs I ween, to see what is not to be seen— But with the elucidation of the Apostle it becomes a solemn and sublime principle; and Mr Lothrop ingeniously brought it to bear upon the duties of every individual of his hearers. Mr Lothrop and Mr Colton dined with us, and after dinner we rode together to the Temple— But Mr Colton went to the Episcopal church to hear Mr Clark— Miss Cutts only of the Ladies attended at the Meeting.— Mr Lothrop preached from 2. Corinthians 3.6.— “For the Letter, killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life”— This also is only the last clause of a verse the remainder of which was omitted.— It is the entrance upon that same exposition of principle for which the text of the morning had been selected.— The drift of the discourse was the same. Mr Colton came and walked with me round the garden and nursery, took tea, and spent the Evening with us— Mr Beale, and his two daughters were also here this evening. "

I take the shower bath every morning while the dog-day weather continues.— There was a thunder shower this morning, and one startling thunder clap while we were at breakfast—but the atmosphere was not swept clean. The day past with alternate shower and Sunshine, sultry and damp—seeming to clear off before Sunset— Mr Colton came in, soon after breakfast and remained with me till near 1. O’Clock P.M— He has ready for the press and Stereotyping at New-York a book in two octavo volumes, to be called the Life and Times of Henry Clay. Mr Colton spoke to me of this work last Spring at Washington— And he comes now to gather materials to interweave in the narrative—of Mr Clay’s life— Among others of these materials are the incidents of the controversy between me and Jonathan Russell concerning our Negotiation at Ghent one of the critical periods of my Life. In that controversy Russell performed the parts of a bungling Assassin for the benefit of Mr Clay against me— He broke down and Clay deserted him.— In 1843. Daniel Mallory published in two large Octavo volumes the Life and Speeches of Henry Clay— An Electioneering mass of fulsome adulation, with not a little misrepresentation of the questions relating to the Fisheries and the Mississippi— There is another Life of Henry Clay, by an Editor of a Newspaper at Louisville Kentucky named Prentiss, equally partial and falsifying— Mr Colton’s Life will be an unqualified panegyric, and I do not much rely on the frankness and candour with which he will deal in the differences between Mr Clay and me— But he comes to me for information, and I gave it, sparing Clay as much as truth and my conscience would let me— He asked me to lend him my book upon the duplicate Letters, the Fisheries and the Mississippi, which I did— He took it with him Saturday evening to his lodgings at French’s tavern. He returned it to me this morning, and said he had read it— He was inquisitive concerning the Panama mission out of which he expects to weave a magnificent monument of glory to Mr Clay’s Statesmanship. But there is not much in it— I read to Mr Colton, all the entries in my Diary of July 1818. of Mr Monroe’s Cabinet Meetings upon Genl. Andrew Jackson—his invasion of Florida and the Seminole War— Mr Colton finally took leave of me, and returns to New-York to superintend the publication of his book— Mrs President Quincy who is spending some days with her daughter Mrs Waterston at the old family mansion, yesterday at meeting invited me to come, and take tea with them this evening, which I promised, and accordingly walked down there, and spent the Evening with them— Mrs Quincy, Mr and Mrs Waterston, their little daughter, Sophia Quincy and one of the two Misses Ruthven, aunts of Mr Waterston were there— Mr and Mrs Waterston have Albums with autographs engraved portraits and scraps of writing of eminent persons which they shewed me. Mrs Waterston lent me Mrs Jameson’s Visits and Sketches at home and abroad, which she much admires— I rode home— Miss Cutts has taken profile likenesses of my wife and of me. "

                "text": "12. II.45. Tuesday.  One of the premonitory symptoms of the approaching close of my career is the constant gradual diminution of my nightly Sleep.— I retire to bed regularly soon after 10. O’Clock when I came out here, near the last of May I awoke usually as the Clock struck 4— A month later I was awaked morning after morning by the Clock in the entry striking 3. and now I hear it almost every morning strike two.— I rose this morning a quarter before 3. and was consequently heavy and drowsy the whole day— Isaac Hull Adams was here this morning He is employed in the public service by Albert Smith of Maine— Commissioner for drawing the division line between the United States and the British North American possessions.— He was at Rous’s point; but in the extreme illness of his mother, they sent for him, and he arrived a few days since, on a leave of absence— I spoke to him of the annuity interest, which had belonged to his Sister, the late Mrs. Angier, and told him what disposal had been made of it since her death. My correspondence with Mr Angier on the subject— My receipt of the money from the Massachusetts hospital life Insurance company. My transfer of it to Mr Angier, and his proposal that it should be invested for the benefit of mother and Sister Elizabeth which he approved, but said he had expected it would have gone entirely to Mr Angier— I requested that he would inform his brother John Quincy of all the facts which he promised to do— His mother is dying a lingering death already more than five months in agonizing progress, and still protracted hopeless of all relief. When I rose this morning the sky was in an incessant blaze of lightning flashes, but I heard no Thunder— There followed a long and copious shower of rain after which it cleared off, warm, bright and calm for the remainder of the day. I take the Shower bath every morning, and an hour and a half of self-friction and ablution which serves for the exercise of the day.— But my Resolution from the first day of this month to write one Letter every-day has already fallen through. I wrote this day, answers to C. Andrews Lester Consul of the United States at Genoa, but now at New-York, who proposes to dedicate to me, the translation of an Italian book which he is about to publish, and to the Rev’d Nicholas Murray, who as Chairman of a Committee of the Inhabitants of Elizabeth-town, New Jersey, has invited me to deliver an Address before them on the 24th. of November next when they propose to dedicate a monument which they are erecting to the memory of the Revd. James Caldwell, shot dead in his own house, during the War of Independence— Both these Letters have given me some embarrassment.  7. Reminiscences of America from 4. September 1801. to 5. August 1809.  1806. concluded— Dinner at W. N. Boylston, at Jamaica Plains. 20. June, remove to Dr Waterhouse’s at Cambridge.— His Lectures on Natural History— Composition and Delivery of my own Lectures— 11.

Besides my Shower bath, my horse-hair mitten and strap-frictions and my foot-bath and spunging, I spent an hour this morning in planting my Washington Plum-Stones and Mazard Cherry Stones at sundry places in the Garden and seminary; and I have had three empty Champagne boxes filled with earth, and have buried in them 2 of these Plum stones, and half a dozen mazzard cherries each to ascertain if they will come up.— At the horticultural exhibition last Saturday were several specimens of red Astracan Apples, and bough apples of fine appearance, but what I chiefly want now are winter Apples— Mr Todd a purser in the Navy and his wife, a daughter of the late Dr. Aaron Hill of Cambridge called here on a visit to Miss Cutts, on their way to Hull, where they go for a Summer excursion— Mr Waterston brought me last Saturday Evening a large package from President Quincy, containing his answer to my Letter of enquiry of 19. May last, in behalf of the Committee of the board of Overseers of Harvard University, and sundry other subsidiary public documents, which imperiously demand my most earnest attention— When shall I give it? Patent Office!— Anti-Masonry! Texas Robbery! Whig Committee, claim your rights! Palsied hand! Sluggish mind! Helpless age! which of you must bear the blame? I received this morning Charles Sumner’s 4th. of July Oration recently delivered, which he calls the True Grandeur of Nations— It is a highly wrought, learned, ingenious diatribe against War: of course very ill suited to the occasion; but of this he takes no heed— He assumes that there never can be a necessity for War, and admits of no discrimination between offensive and defensive War— Mr Sumner takes a lofty flight and promises to become a leading politician— The fallacy of his argument lies in its universality.— The Oration and Appendix fill 104 pages— I received also a Letter from Edward L. Keyes Editor of the Norfolk County American at Dedham; concerning a supposed claim of the heirs or legal representatives of the late Governor John Brooks, for bounty lands for his military Services in the War for Independence— Keyes’s wife is daughter of the widow of Coll. Alexander S. Brooks son and heir of the Governor.

IV:15 Thursday  I received this morning a Letter from my Son; dated Tuesday last at Lebanon Springs, stating that he with his party would leave that place the next day, and pass it at Lenox with his daughter Louisa Catherine, it being her birth day entering upon her 15th. birthday year— That they intended to return home this day, and requesting us to send Fuller with the Carriage to meet them at the Western Railroad Depot, upon the arrival at Boston of the afternoon train of Cars, which was done. President Quincy was here this morning, and I had some conversation with him concerning his Report and answer to my enquiries, which are satisfactory. Mr Quincy anxiously desires that an immediate effort should be made to raise by subscription a further sum of 50000 dollars to provide a permanent support for an observer and assistant at the Cambridge Observatory.— I told him that I should as soon as possible communicate his Answer and the documents annexed to it, to the other members of the Committee of the Overseers; and would urge an immediate appeal to the liberal friends of Science for a further subscription— But I said that Mr Abbott Lawrence at the Meetings of the Committee in the Spring, while favouring this project had dwelt emphatically on the idea, that to ensure its success it would be indispensably necessary, that the funds of the University itself should liberally contribute to make up the sum for this establishment. but I observed that he was very explicit in the opinion that the University could contribute nothing further to this purpose— He said his remarks on this subject were merely his individual opinions, for which the Corporation was not responsible— That Mr Lawrence was perhaps not aware of what the University had already expended for the accomplishment of this undertaking— But if the Committee should finally think it absolutely necessary to require a further application of the University funds to fill up the contribution from without, he did not wish them to consider his opinion as barring the proposal to the corporation— Mr Francis Jackson was here, and said the Hutchinson family, a minstrel company of brothers and Sisters from New-Hampshire, who for the last two or three years have been strolling about this country giving concerts vocal and instrumental, had concluded to go to England, and would be glad to take a Letter of introduction from me to Mr Edward Everett our late Minister to Great Britain or to Mr Louis M’Lane, his successor— I said it would give me no great pleasure, if it were in my power to serve the Hutchinson family; but that as Mr Everett had engaged his passage home in the Liverpool Steamer, to depart on the first of September; and a Letter to him could not reach him before that time—and that my personal relations with Mr Louis M’Lane were of a nature not to admit of my giving Letters of Introduction to him— Mr Jackson said he had told them that he had told them that he thought it probable I should decline to give Letters, but he had been willing to ask the favour for them.— I received a Letter from John C. Randall, Manager of the Newbury port Lyceum inviting me to deliver the introductory Lecture to their course next October—and answered it immediately, declining— My present experience is ascertaining that one page of Diary and one page of a Letter, is the utmost daily labour that I can at this time perform—a sad prognostic for the accomplishment of my tasks. At half past 8 this evening Fuller returned from Boston with the Carriage, freighted with my Son and his party, returned from their excursion to Lenox and Lebanon Springs. "

I have no doubt that from this day forward, with a clear sky the Star Sirius may be seen rising before the Sun—and that is the Astronomical closing of the dog-days— The Massachusetts Register and United States Calendar of this year 1845 sets down the dog days as beginning on the 25th. of July and ending the 6th. of September— It is said in Rees’s Encyclopaedia Volume 6. Article Canicular days, that in an antient Calendar preserved by Bede, the beginning of the dog days was placed on the 14th. of July, which is perhaps the authority upon which our learned Astronomers and Chronologists now fix it on the 25th. But after numerous changes, Rees says that of late, a very proper alteration has been introduced into the almanacs, and they have been made to commence with the 3d. of July and to finish with the 11th. of August, corresponding very well with the Astronomical phenomenon which attributes them to the heliacal rising and setting of Sirius.— Mrs Martha Burrill was here. I had sent her papers to the Commissioner of Pensions, with an enquiry why her pension had been discontinued. I had received the answer of Mr Edwards that the pension had been granted under the act of 3. March 1837—and was withdrawn by the repeal of the act in 1842. I read to her Mr Edwards’s Letter, and returned her papers, equally mortified with the enormous dilapidations of the act of 1837 and at the penurious injustice of the repeal of 1842. filching from this poor widow her pittance of 6 dollars a month because twenty thousand dollars had been without a shadow of right lavished upon David Porter from the Navy pension fund.— Mrs Burrell received with good temper the information of the loss of her pension, and thanked me for the trouble I had taken in her behalf. Mr Thornton is a cousin of Miss Cutts and came from Boston to visit her, dined with us and returned by Gillet’s 3 O’Clock Stage.  9. Reminiscences of America from 4. September 1801. to 5.

My nephew John Quincy Adams 2. was here yesterday, and spoke of his mother’s condition as being at the last extremity, and in the opinion of Dr Woodward, rapidly failing— I asked him if Mr John Angier had been recently there. He said he had been there for a short time the day before— I enquired if he had said any thing on the disposal of the proceeds from the annuity in trust—he said he believed he had not— I then told John Quincy all that had passed on this subject of my correspondence on the subject with Mr Angier. I said that in my last Letter to him, transmitting the sum that I had received from the Life and trust company I had reminded him of the state of Mrs T. B. Adams’s health and of the imminent prospect of her demise— That this event would introduce new considerations regarding the disposal of the funds and new enquiries concerning its distribution— And I advised that if Mr Angier should come again, it would be well to enquire of him, what disposal he has made or proposes to make of the funds— This morning I went to Boston, accompanied by Miss Cutts, and my Grand daughter Mary-Louisa. I gave a sitting of an hour and a quarter to Mr John C. King the Sculptor for my bust, and am apprehensive that he will not succeed with the likeness— His little son was with him—a handsome and very quiet child.— I then called at the Post Office, and deposited my letter to Mr Randall, manager of the Newbury port Lyceum— Called at the Wine Store of John D. andWilliams, and bespoke a 20 gallon Cask of Port wine at 1. dollar. 50 cents a gallon— At my Sons Office to ascertain the locality of Jordan, Swift and Wiley for whom I had yesterday received a Letter from George H. Colton with 20 copies of my Lecture on Society and civilization extracted from the American Review for July and ten copies of the Review itself.— I found Mr A. C. Spooner at Charles’s Office— Jordan, Swift and Wiley’s Book-store is at 121. Washington Street, and there I delivered the Letter— Then I called for the Ladies at Chandler and Greenleaf’s Store and we went to the exhibition of the horticultural Society, which was not so rich in fruits as it had been last Saturday— I took 4. Duane’s purple plums for 25 cents— I stop’d at Dr Bigelow’s house, and consulted him concerning some of my ailments—for one of which he gave me a small box of ointment— A Dr. Muzzy came in while I was there— We returned home to dine— I had seen Mr Jacob Lawrence at the counting house of his father Abbott Lawrence to whom I wished to communicate the papers received from President Quincy— Mr Abbott Lawrence is at Sharon, and intends to return to Boston next Saturday.— His Son promised to write to him that I will call to see him the day before Commencement— This afternoon I had visits from Dr. George Parkman and a Mr Mercer from the State of Mississippi—from Mr Robert G. Shaw and his daughter who was born in Mrs Black’s, now Mr Daniel Greenleaf’s house and from a Mr Breese of Cincinnati, formerly of Utica, and brother of Sidney Breese U.S. Senator from the State of Illinois.

The iron Steamship Great Britain of 3600 tons born with six Masts, and Archimedean screw propellers left Liverpool on the 26th. of July and arrived at New-York last Sunday at Noon, after a passage of 16 days— Yesterday the Steamer Cambria, Captain Judkins departed from Boston and this day the Steamer Hibernia, Captain Alexander Ryrie, arrived having left Liverpool on the 5th. of this Month. I notice these events as tributary to the history of Steam Navigation and of the world— Of the rumours of War with Mexico, for several of the last days prevalent, I have as yet said nothing, because I do not yet believe them— This morning Mr Lunt preached from Matthew 21.28. [“]But what think ye? A certain man had two Sons; and he came to the first, and said, Go, work to day, in my vineyard. 29. He answered and said, I will not; but afterwards he repented, and went. 30. And he came to the second, and said likewise; and he answered and said I go, Sir: and went not. 31. Whether of them twain, did the will of his father?— They say unto him the first”— Here the text stop’d— The remainder of the verse is, “Jesus saith unto them, verily, I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.” This was the application made by Jesus himself of this parable, to his immediate hearers, the chief-priests and elders of the people, and pharisees, who came to him as he was teaching in the temple, and demanded of him his authority for teaching, and for turning the money changers out of the temple— Jesus retorted upon them their question of his authority by asking them what they thought of the baptism of John; whether it was from Heaven, or of men? They were afraid to answer him, and said they could not tell—whereupon he refuses to tell them his authority— But he gives out this parable to justify his mission to publicans, and harlots in preference to them— Mr Lunt however dwelt entirely upon the commandment Go, work, today, in my vineyard—and he expatiated with vivid eloquence upon the duty incumbent upon all Christians to work in the vineyard of the Lord, and concluding with an apologue of Ben Hassan, to whom a Genius appeared on three successive Nights saying go—work in my vineyard— Ben Hassan makes each Night some frivolous excuse for not heeding the voice of the Genius, and disobeying his command. The Genius comes and repeats it the fourth time, when Ben Hassan starts to go to work, stumbles at the first step, and falls into his grave— A striking lesson which I had heard before— Mr Lunt gave out as the second hymn of the morning service, the 8th. of his collection— My version of the 67th. Psalm. His afternoon text was from Psalm 51.6. [“]Behold, thou desirest truth, in the inward parts.”—omitting the remainder of the verse—and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom—This is one of the penitential psalms, but Mr Lunt’s special theme was the inflexible adherence to truth in the inward parts— A fertile soil, but a beaten path— Truth and Good are the Heaven of Swedenborg, but Pilate’s question to Jesus, what is Truth is yet unanswered.— Mr Degrand came out from Boston this afternoon, and took tea and spent the evening with us. Among the Newspapers which he brought out was Willmer and Smith’s European Times of the 5th. of this Month, published at Liverpool— Charles and his wife were here. "

My Son’s birth-day, 38  In the patch of my central seminary row, next but one to the barn, I planted one of the Stones of the Duane purple plums which I purchased last Saturday at the Horticultural Rooms— I marked it with a small stake to ascertain if it will come up next Spring, though I never retain the memory of these notices from season to season— There arepatches in the Seminary untenanted because my plantations in them heretofore have failed.— I have had them now filled with fresh earth; and intend to sow and plant in them for next Summer’s vegetation— We had visits this day from Mr Gales, and his adopted daughter Juliana Walker, and from Coll. Paul Anderson of Cincinnati, who since his former visit of 27. of July has been down to Eastport and Passamaquoddy, and then to Plymouth, and the Old Colony. He is now on his return home, accompanied by a Mr Tillson, a native of Plymouth County, but now an inhabitant of Quincy, Adams County Illinois— Scarce a single day passes but I receive newspapers, pamphlets or books, very often without notice from whom; and I cannot even conjecture. Sometimes from friend—occasionally from foe. One day to ask permission to dedicate a book to me. Another insulting and scurrilous— I am too much tickled with the flattery—too much prickled with the abuse. I ought to receive both with profound indifference— I regular receive from I know not whom the Cherokee Advocate a weekly Newspaper, published every Thursday in the English and Cherokee languages at Tahlequah— I have now on hand received this day, the Southern Quarterly Review N. 15 for July, and a Letter from the Revd. Dr Samuel H. Coxe of Brooklyn New-York, saying that the Revd B. I. Lane of West Troy New-York is about to publish a work of some research and excellence entitled Tobacco and its mysteries.— That he Dr Coxe has consented to write an Introduction to it, and wishes to write it in the form of an inscription to me.— This Letter should have been answered this day— But I determined no longer to procrastinate the binding of 5 volumes of my miscellaneous writings as a gift for my Son which I have been these 3 years preparing. I made therefore a final index to the 5th. volume, which occupied the whole afternoon.  10. Reminiscences of America from 4. September 1801. to 5. August 1809.  1808. New-Year’s visit to President Jefferson— James Monroe. Genl. Wilkinson. Report on the case of John Smith of Ohio— National Intelligencer.— Neal and Dearborn Secretary of War— Erskine, Rose— 2 Casamajor’s and Mansfield— Presidential Election Caucus— Giles’s Committee for a Treason Bill.— Talk with Giles— War between Russia and Great Britain.— Talk with Josiah Quincy.— Sloan’s motion to remove the Seat of Government— Talk with Cook—with Bradley.— Tiffin’s seventh Circuit judicial bill— Embargo Bills. Duel between Barent Gardenier and George W. Campbell. Talk with, W. C. Nicholas and Robinson of Vermont. 15. March conversation with President Jefferson— Rose’s abortive Negotiation— Message from P.U.S. with diplomatic documents. Monroe’s Letter of Self-defense. My Letter to H. G. Otis on the Embargo. Vote to expel John Smith 19 to 10. Hillhouse’s Dissertation. "

I took at last to the Bookbinders the Miscellanies of my own composition heretofore published in 8vo. and smaller form, chronologically assorted to be bound in five volumes to be given as a bequest in advance to my Son— Of several of them there is perhaps no other copy now extant— They are all so little estimated by the world that no other collection of them will ever probably ever be made— Whether any value will be set upon them by my own descendents for whose benefit, I have gathered this compilation is more than I can foresee— Some of them have had a temporary popularity— But Volumes have been published of the Speeches of Daniel Webster, of Edward Everett and of Henry Clay.— No such collection has ever been published, of mine— They have therefore never taken hold of the public mind so as to leave a demand for them after the occasions which produced them have passed away.— Their popularity has been evanescent, and I have no right to hope that they will ever emerge from that class of literary labours, which like Thorold’s Lord Mayor’s day—“lived in Settles numbers one day more.” That they may live in the Memory of my own posterity somewhat longer, I have resorted to this expedient of leaving these volumes as a memorial to my Son. With him and with his children it remains to prolong my existence in Memory, when I shall be here no more.— I received this morning from the author, a pamphlet of 156 pages on the Unconstitutionality of Slavery, by Lysander Spooner— A man with whom I have already had some not very pleasant relations, and who in pursuing principles to their extreme consequences, heeds not of whom or of what he runs foul. I have also received half a dozen copies of the annual address delivered before the Cincinnati Astronomical Society. June 1845. with the Reports of the Board of Control, and of the Director of the Observatory (Professor Mitchell.)— I read the Address by E. D. Mansfield Esqr. with great pleasure— Its views of the usefulness of Astronomical Science, and observatories are in many respects new, and specially applicable to our western States, to the surveys and admeasurements of the public Lands, and to the political condition and history past and future of our western States— In reading it, and the Reports of the board of Control, and of Professor Mitchell, the question occurred to me whether I could not from these materials elicit some pregnant ideas, for the organization of the Astronomical Observatory at Harvard University, and for a final Report to the House of Representatives of the United States upon the Smithsonian bequest? Let me not forget these suggestions.— Mr Gill the bookbinder was at Boston— I left the directions for binding with his shop-boy— While I was out I missed the visits of Mr Pakenham the British Minister, and of Mr M’Tavish the British Consul at Baltimore. They came out from Boston, and waited some time for my return— They have been some days at Boston, and were to leave this afternoon for Niagara. "

Sun set 6.55  The succession of fine summer weather is yet uninterrupted but the mornings of the last five days have been beclouded and foggy— So that I have had no chance to see either Sirius or the rising Sun; but yesterday and this evening I saw him set in glory, from the porch of my Son’s house.— I received this morning from Mrs. Mary T. Derby of Medfield a copy of the official Register of the Officers and Cadets of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point for June 1845. with a note referring to the standing of her Son George H. Derby, whose admission to the Academy 1. July 1842. I obtained as a special favour from John Bell, Secretary of War in 1841— In the Register of 1843. Derbys name stood, Number 6. of the 4th. Class, and 90 on the conduct roll— On that of the present year he stands Number 5 of the second Class and 57 of the conduct roll— The five highest numbers of each class are stellated as distinguished and Derby has risen one step into the privileged portion— I received also a Letter from my young kinsman Alexander S. Johnson of New-York, with a duodecimo volume of 219 pages— Essays on human rights and their political guaranties, by his partner in the practice of the Law E. P. Hurlbut.— This book as well as that of Lysander Spooner is among the signs of the Times.— The agitation of the questions of the lawfulness of War and Slavery ferments in the human mind, and inflames all the ambitious Spirits of the civilized world in both hemispheres— I had received last December a Letter from the Revd Allen Greely of Turner, Oxford County—Maine, enclosing a copy of a Letter from my mother to Mrs Elizabeth Norton dated Philadelphia 28. December 1799 and requesting of me a copy of my mothers published Letters— I had no copy of them that I could send to him, and in the pressure of public business had neglected to answer his Letter— This day I received another Letter reminding me that he had written to me two Letters, the last enclosing the Letter from my mother to Mrs Norton, and had received no answer to either requesting an acknowledgment—an autograph of B. Franklin, and of any other revolutionary worthy, or any old book or document— After an hour spent in thrumming over my last winter’s files of Letters, I found that enclosing my mother’s Letter, and immediately answered it, and instead of the books and papers requested by Mr Greely which I have not, I send him judge Willard Hall’s plea for the Sabbath and the July number of G. H. Colton’s American Review— Mr. George Alexander Otis came and introduced to me his Son Edmund Burke Otis, a graduate of Harvard University of 1842. He told me that he was studying Law, and at the same time was acting as an amanuensis to W. H. Prescott in his historical labours— And that he is now occupied upon two works—the conquest of Peru—and the reign of Philip the second— I enquired whether he proposed to publish a history of Charles the fifth— He said he had some reluctance to encounter Dr Robertson— I hoped he would overcome it.

Sultry afternoon— Apparently clear evening— My Son went to Boston with me this morning— I alighted at Amory Hall, but Mr John C. King had not yet got to his chamber. I walked to Dr Frothingham’s, but the servant at his door told me that he was gone to the white mountains, and was expected home this day. I returned to Amory hall, and gave a sitting of an hour for my bust to Mr King.— Mr Robert Gourlay was with him, a Scotchman who some 25 years ago was breeding a revolution in Canada, till the Colonial Government without regard to any Habeas Corpus Laws, took him up bodily and sent him off to England, where they tried and acquitted him—since which he has been a dead Letter— He still keeps up an obscure War, with the colonial government, but cannot or dares not return to his residence there, and has lived the last two or three years at Boston— His conversation is entertaining, though he still affects the character of a reformer. At 11. O’Clock I walked up to the State-house, and after half an hour waiting in the Secretary’s Office, judge White and Mr Walley came in, we repaired to the Council chamber, and I read the report which I had drawn up on the reference of the communication from the Corporation of the resignation of President Josiah Quincy. The report was of 3. Resolutions proposed for adoption by the board of Overseers. 1. A full and unqualified concurrence with the sentiments of personal respect and approbation of the administration of the Presidents Office by Mr Quincy, expressed by the Letter of the members of the Corporation to him of 29. March 1845 accepting his resignation. 2. A resolution of special commendation upon three points of peculiar merits in the administration of Mr Quincy, not noticed in the Letter signed by the members of the Corporation— 1. His inflexible firmness in maintaining the necessary discipline. 2. His exertions to elevate the standard of acquisitions for admission to the University, and to enlarge the circle of Science attainable within its system of instructions and 3. His History of the University— 3. That a copy of these Resolutions signed by the Governor of the Commonwealth as the presiding officer of the board of Overseers be communicated to Mr Quincy, at the close of the performances on the approaching commencement day. Mr Walley intimated some objection to the first of my Resolutions expressing entire concurrence with the Letter of the Corporation— I offered to consider any amendment which he would propose, but judge White defended the Resolution so earnestly that Mr Walley said he would assent to it as it was.— The Meeting of the Overseers was thinly attended. John P. Bigelow as a member of the Council presided— As chairman of the Committees on the honorary degrees he reported the confirmation of them all; which was unanimously adopted. I read my report which was also unanimously accepted, without a word of remark from any one. I asked Dr. Pierce to send a copy of the Relutions Governor Briggs which he promised to do— My Son was there and returned home to Quincy to dinner— Afternoon reading Mr Rush. Fire this Evening. "

                "text": " 22. IV. Friday.  The fire last evening was of the barn of Captain Edward Pray in Braintree near Weymouth landing. His Store was damaged, but not consumed. This morning I was surprized by the appearance of a shoot from the 5th. shagbark seedlings which first came up in the corner square of the orchard behind the garden, last Summer— I barely noticed them then. When I first visited the spot last Spring 3. May, there was no vestige of the stems that had come up last year. They had been all winter killed— At the second visit 23. May, one stem was up, much like that which now appears— It was killed within a fortnight afterwards by a sharp frosty Night, and has vanished. The second third and fourth came up successively in May, June and July with stems four, three and two inches long, and put out each 3 lateral stalks on each of which 3 or 5 leaflets have expanded to their usual size on the full grown tree. The stem after its first shoot grows no more— The object of nursing it by cultivation would be to form a bud at the top of the stem from which the stem of the next year would spring— This I have never been able to do, but never before the present Season have I had the opportunity to observe the progress of vegetation of this walnut seedling through the whole summer from day to day. I have been watching full six weeks for the appearance of the 5th. stem, and had given it up in despair, when I found it up its full length this morning in two shoots. No trace of the first remains above ground—nor is there a single stem up from any of the nuts which I committed to the ground last Autumn— I trimme off a number of shoots, one of them 3 feet 9 inches long grown this year from the stump of an old apple tree, which I trimmd last year by way of experiment— I now left one shoot near four feet long, and still growing.— My old hickory 40 years of age bears this year more than usual. One horse plum sucker bears this year for the first time— I had this day no interruption but answered a Letter from Mrs Mary T. Derby, concerning the standing of her Son George H. Derby as a cadet at West Point— He is in the 2d. class, and has risen to be the 5th. name on the study roll of the class. I answered also a Letter from Revd. N. Murray of Elizabethtown New-Jersey concerning the Caldwell monument, and read in President Quincy’s history of Harvard College and in Lysander Spooner’s unconstitutionality of Slavery.  11.

They have engaged Mr. Ariel P. Chute as Principal, to commence on the 6th. of September, next, having been for several years connected with the Warren Academy, at Woburn— There is in the Quincy Patriot of this morning an Article, signed a Parent, referring to the donations of my father to the town of Quincy, especially to that for the erection of a Stone School house over the cellar of the Hancock house, and enquiring into the condition of that fund with a view to the erection of that school house— I said to Mr Lunt that I was glad to see that Article, and thought it quite time for the town of Quincy to consider of the expediency and propriety of undertaking to erect this building— Mr Lunt made no objection but seemed to take no interest in the suggestion— I must undertake it against wind and tide— And the first thing to be done is to propose it to the Supervisors of the fund, and then to the town— Mr Minott Thayer was here with a young man by the name of Ide, a son of the Revd. Jacob Ide of Medway— They had two petitions addressed one to the Governor of Maryland, the other to the Governor of Virginia, couched in the most abject language of supplication, praying for pardon for the Revd. Charles T. Torrey, now for six years, the first of which is nearly completed in the Maryland Penitentiary, for aiding and abetting Slaves in the attempt to escape from their chains— They call it negro-stealing. For the Offence in Virginia Torrey has been indicted and demanded by the Governor of Virginia, of the Governor of Maryland, but never tried nor even arrested— Yet the prayer for pardon is in the same terms, with that to the Governor of Maryland— A crouching Spaniel under the lash of its master, is an image of lofty Independence, compared with the prostration of these petitions signed by Levi Lincoln, John Davis, and 30 or 40 names of the brightest stars of Massachusetts— I was requested to sign them and young Ide said his father had been desirous that my name should stand first of the signers.— Mr Torrey’s wife is a daughter of Dr. Ide, and he has several children. I said I should be glad to render any service in my power to obtain the release and liberation of Mr Torrey, but I declined signing the petition, and thought it a much more grievous offence against moral principle, than the acts which Mr Torrey is expiating in the penitentiary— I specified my objections to the petitions and Mr. Thayer said he had foreseen and foretold that I would refuse to sign them.— He asked if I had any objection to their being presented to my Son for his signature— I answered none in the world— My Son had a judgment of his own, and I wished him to exercise it. Mr Ide said he had no doubt his father would approve my decision.  From about 4. O’Clock this afternoon to half past 7. there was one of the most terrific thunder-storms that I ever witnessed— My Son and his 3 elder boys was bathing but found shelter at Eaton’s house before the rain.

                "text": "24. IV. Sunday.  The lightening of the last evening’s storm struck in two places in this town of Quincy and set fire to a barn which was consumed with eight tons of hay.— This day the Sun was bright, without abatement of the Summer heat. Dr. Alvan Lamson of Dedham preached his morning text was from 2 Corinthians 3.6. The same from which Mr Lothrop had preached this day fortnight.— [“]For the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life.” Dr Lamson opened the drift of his discoure by observing that in every thing connected with the nature and condition of man there was a Letter and a Spirit, and that in every thing, death was inseparbly connected with the Letter, and life with the Spirit— This general principle he illustrated by a great variety of specifications, and numerous quotations from the new testament, among which the declaration of Jesus in Luke 14.26.— “If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren and sisters, yea, and his life also, he cannot be my disciple” was one— Dr. Lamson dined with us; and I said to him that this saying of Jesus was the figure of speech in rhetoric was a hyperbole— That all his language was figurative that one of the evangelists says he never spoke without a parable—that is without a fictitious tale, a metaphor, an allegory or a symbol. That among his frequent figurative forms of speech was the hyperbole, which expresses more than it means— And I said that was my interpretation of all his precepts for the forgiveness of injuries— When if smitten on one cheek he tells his disciple to turn the other to be smitten also—when if a man takes your coat, he bids you give him your cloak, when if he compels you to go with him one mile you are commanded to go with him twain— All these are Hyperboles expressing more than they mean.— Dr Lamson said he concurred with me in these opinions— His afternoon Sermon was from Matt 21.28.— “Son, go, work to day, in my vineyard” a small part of the same text, from which Mr Lunt preached last Sunday morning.— Mr Lamson however took a different view of the subject— As the command was to work to-day in the lord’s vineyard, he dwelt with most emphasis upon the word to-day, and undertook to expound the full import and meaning of a Christian’s working day—how its morning should be opened with humble and fervent prayer— Its noontide and afternoon with labours for self support, and in the discharge of duties to promote the wefare and happiness of others; and its close at Night with a strict and conscientious review of the past; with the voice of gratitude to God, for the continuance of existence and for all blessings received, and meditations of future good, soothing the spirit to repose— An excellent discourse, though a still more comprehensive exposition of this parable might form an interesting lecture, analysing the contrasted character of the two brothers—the peculiarity of the question, which of the two did the will of the father, and the turn given by the wisdom of Jesus from the enquiry by what authority he did these things to his closing declaration that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before the inquisitors into his authority.— I read a second time, the Sermon of Samuel F. Dike, at the Dedication of the New Jerusalem Temple in Bath, Maine, on the Doctrines of the New Jerusalem— The doctrine of correspondence is diluted into something like sense. "

Two young men by the name of Edwards, brothers visited me this morning, one of them being now a resident in this town of Quincy, and the other having been so heretofore, but having removed to the western Country, and here only on a visit to see his brother— Their call on me was merely of curiosity, and my conversation with them was of little interest. Joseph Crane is also an inhabitant of Quincy— He came to make enquiries which I was not able to answer.— He said there had been in some English Newspaper, and republished perhaps in the New-York herald an advertisement calling for information of the heirs of John Young a man who had emigrated from England and died in this country, but it was not known where— The motive for the advertisement was not stated— It was probable there might be large property coming to the heirs of John Young—but it might be from creditors seeking for property to answer for debts. Mr Crane said that the name of his wife’s father had been John Young, but they had no knowledge of where he was in the latter years of his life nor where he died.— Mr Crane wanted advice how to proceed in his enquiries on this subject— I thought his first process should be to procure the newspapers in which the advertisement had appeared—one of which he knew was the true Sun of New-York—but of what date he did not know. I said it must be easy to ascertain at the Office where that paper is published. There he might learn from whom and for what purpose the advertisement was issued—whether Mrs Crane’s father was the individual whose heirs were enquired for and if so, by what evidence his identity could be proved to the advertiser. This step, to procure the paper containing the advertisement I thought preliminary to all further proceedings in the case, on his part— Mr E. Price Greenleaf was here this afternoon, and budded for me several apple, and several pear seedling stocks— But he said he did not expect that any one of them would succeed, the extreme heat and dryness of the Season having withered the germ of the buds, so that they would not take and live on the foreign stock.— Mrs. Frothingham and her son Thomas came out from Boston to take tea with Mrs. Charles, and they called here. I received a Letter from Calvin Colton asking for copies of John Rhea’s Letter to James Monroe on his dying bed, and of Mr. Monroe’s affidavit then made—and of William Wirt’s Letter to Saml. L.

Thursday  Prize and Declamations and Φ.B.K.—  There fell a heavy rain during the whole of the commencement performances yesterday, and it did not subside till about 5 in the afternoon.— With my Son, his Son John Quincy, and my grand daughter I returned home leaving Miss Cutts at Mr. Batchelder’s whence she proposes to go on Saturday to Saco in the State of Maine— At 6. O’Clock this morning I left home again with my Son, and his Son John Quincy, and leaving them at the depot of the train of the Railway cars for New-Bedford, at the foot of the Common in Boston, I proceeded alone to Cambridge, and just before 8 alighted at the President’s house where I found Mr Quincy and all his family at Breakfast— Immediately after I accompanied him to his Study where we were joined shortly after by nine other judges of the Boylston prize declamations.— There were 13. names of Candidates entered for the prizes of 11 of which were of the Class yesterday graduated and two of the Senior Class—none of the junior Class— One of the Class yesterday graduated, and one of the Seniors did not perform.— We proceeded to the new Church opposite to the College yard, where a small company of auditors were assembled—more of Ladies than of men— Of the subjects entered four were from speeches of Daniel Webster—one from E. Everett’s Eulogy on LaFayette—Shakespear—Milton, Byron, furnished the other with one from Dickens’s Pickwick, and one in Latin from Cicero’s Catiline— The effect of this institution has been to produce one level merit in the mode of speaking—perfect memories—no canting; all equable intonation, but a deficiency of intense feeling, a dull uniformity of gesticulation, and a failure in the contrasted elevation and depression of the voice which nature stamps on the passions of man— There were 11 speakers, and 11. judges— The first prize was awarded to Hinchman who spoke Gloster’s Soliloquy in Shakespear’s 3d. part of Henry the 6th. the second first prize to Ropes, who spoke from Croly’s views of the apocalypse. The second prizes were assigned to Dexter, Hayward, and Davison, the only one who ventured to speak the language of Cicero. We returned to the Church; Mr Quincy announced the successful competitors and awarded the prizes.— We then went with professor Pierce and visited the Observatory. Mr Bond was in Boston, but his wife and Son were there. The movable roof is not yet on, but the piers on which the Frauenhofer refractor, and the transit and equatorial are to be fixed are ready to receive them We then attended the Meeting of the ΦB.K. Society— Heard the Oration byPeabody, the Poem by C. T. Brooks and dined in the University Hall— I took leave of Mr Quincy’s family and returned home alone. "

There is an excitement in the multitudes of persons and rapid evolution of incidents in the two successive days of Commencement at Harvard University, and of the prize-declamations and Φ.B.K. of the next day, that after they are over it seems to me as if I have been in a trance, living, moving and being in another world different from that of my present habitual existence— Commencement day carries me back to that on which I was myself graduated one of the exquisitely happy days, yet saddened with the pang of parting forever from loved associates, and from cherished studies to enter upon another career of anticipations full of timid hope and awful fear—one of the dies fasti of my life—and that by an association of ideas opens the vista of my whole collegiate period, so short and yet so memorable to me—the friendships then contracted, the extraordinary incidents of my preceding life, and the long interval of 58 years, with all its eventful vicissitudes since elapsed, all these retrospections crowding at once upon my memory shake my shattered nerves and confuse my mind till my whole past life flashes before me like a luminous dream I said yesterday at the dinner that I had entered upon the sixtieth year of my membership of the Φ.B.K. and it startled the juveniles before me. The retirement of President Josiah Quincy after 16 years successful administration of that office gave an additional pleasing and painful interest to all the ceremonies and performances of the two last days— W. C. Rives and his Son, Francis, judge Wayne, President Henry of the South Carolina College and several other strangers were at the dinner, toasted and made speeches— Charles Henry Warren late a judge of the Court of the Common Pleas was elected President of the Society, in the place of Josiah Quincy junr. who declined a re-election— Warren presided at the dinner, with the sprightly wit and humour which runs in the Otis and Warren blood— This morning, autumnal cold, I took my daily shower bath, and endeavoured to resume my hacknied occupations, but could not entirely recover from the dissipation of yesterday, and the day before. H. S. Julian of Louisville Kentucky bought me a Letter of introduction from Henry Clay dated at Ashland, the 12th. of this month, and dined with us.— A few days after Mr Clay wrote this Letter, he went to the white sulphur Springs of Virginia, and the printing press of Cassius M Clay’s Time American was broken up by a gentlemanly mob at Lexington, he himself prostrated by a Typhus fever. Mr Julian returned this afternoon to Boston. Harriet Welsh was here this evening. "

The weather is again warm, but the shower bath of the morning is inefficient to restore to me the stedfastness of my nerves— My physical powers are deserting me; and especially that of writing. Prayer itself leaves me helpless, and the prospect before me is appalling. A young man by the name of Enos T. Dickerman of Stoughton, brought me Letters of recommendation, and certificates of good character and conduct from Jesse Perkins and Eliab Whitman of North Bridgewater—from Calvin Park of Stoughton from Jonathan Battles junr Master of the mathematical department of the Mather school, Boston, from N. Tillinghast teacher of the normal school at Bridgewater, and from Massena B. Ballou, minister of the parish in Stoughton.— He wishes to obtain a warrant of Cadet at the military Academy at West Point next June when by the expiration of George H. Derby’s term of service there will be a vacancy of the Cadet for the 8th. congressional district of Massachusetts— I asked his age, he said 18. and from his conversation I have no doubt he would stand high on the roll of studies. I told him I would write to the Secretary of War and have his name entered as a candidate for a warrant, and would transmit his recommendations to be filed at the Department—but I must apprize him, that I had already presented the names of two other candidates with very strong recommendations for that same appointment, and if called upon next March to nominate I might feel it my duty to name the earliest applicant. With this he appeared to be satisfied— Miss Porter the daughter of the late General Peter B. Porter of Niagara, and sister of Peter Augustus Porter one of the Harvard graduates of last Wednesday, came with a son of Francis Granger of Canandaigua, Timothy B. Lawrence a son of Abbott Lawrence, and a young man named Holley from Western New-York and paid us a morning visit— Mr Healy the Painter was also here— He came from Paris commissioned by King Louis-Philippe to paint for him the portraits of the late General Andrew Jackson—Henry Clay and me— He came just in time to paint Jackson before he died— He has since painted Mr Clay, and now comes for me. He dined with us, and returned immediately af to Boston, being engaged to be there at two O’Clock. I agreed to sit for him two hours next Wednesday, from 11. or half past 11. O’Clock at Mr Charles Hubbard’s room in Tremont row. N. 11. He said that the king had charged him to say that he would have sent a formal request to the persons whose portraits he desired, but that might have made it necessary to enlarge the number, which a necessity for some limitation had restricted him to 3 living characters— Healy says Mr Clay asked him, why his Majesty had not thought of our present President as one of the Americans whose portraits he thought it worth his while to possess.— Harriet Welsh was also here this day.

Mr Lunt preached this morning from Luke 16.1. “And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a Steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.” This was the text. The discourse was an exposition of the whole parable of the unjust Steward, and even of the 15th. and 16th Chapters of which Mr Lunt must be read together comprizing not only this parable but four others three of which are related in the 13th. chapter— That of the man who had lost one of an hundred sheep—that of the woman who lost one of ten pieces of silver, and the story of the prodigal Son. The closing parable of the 16th. chapter is that of the rich man and Lazarus.— All these are parts of one and the same discourse— Multitudes of Publicans and Sinners had assembled and followed him to hear him preach— The pharisees and Scribes made this a charge of reproach against him that he received and ate with vicious and odious companions— By these parables he met and repelled these censures which were highly plausible, and in each of the parables there is a special, distinct and precious lesson of instruction— Mr Lunt pointed out the vital shades of difference between the several principles taught by them.— There was a passage in this particular parable of the unjust Steward, which had given rise to much difficulty of construction, owing to misconceptions of the precise point of morals which it was the purpose of the teacher to inculcate— The unjust Steward called to account by his Lord and unable to meet the call, combines with the debtors to defraud him of their real amount by deducting 50 per cent from one bill and 20 per cent from another.— The fraud succeeds— The lord is cheated of his dues—and the 8th. verse of the chapter say the Lord commanded the unjust Steward, because he had done wisely—for the children “of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light”— This commendation of the Lord Mr Lunt endeavoured to explain away, but the difficulty is insuperable. The Lord upon discovering the cheat practised by his faithless Steward upon himself, commends him for the wisdom of his knavish expedient to indemnify the Steward for the loss of his place, by obtaining a share of the plunder from the dishonest debtors. The commendation is limited to the prudence of the Steward in providing a final retreat for himself—and the advice to the disciples to make to themselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, rather entangles than solves the doubt of the purity of this story as a lesson of morals.— Mr Lunt’s afternoon text was from John 1.14. “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us[”]—one of the strong holds of the Trinitarians, and believers in the divinity of Jesus Christ— Unitarian preachers seldom handle these texts successfully. How the word could be made flesh is to me and must ever in this life remain a mystery. No definite idea can be affixed to these expression. An evacuated Irish Shanty an appendage to the Old Colony railroad and immediately behind my barns and outhouses was set fire to, by no one knows whom, this Evening—and burnt down. We were for a time in great alarm for the barns and the house. "

                "text": "1. IV.15. Monday  Mr. Beale called on me this morning to enquire the price of one of my gallery pews in the Stone Temple. I asked him which of them was desired— He said he wanted two— One for Mr Emmons who is building a house opposite to his, and the other for Coll. George T. Bigelow, who is also about to build near the widow of Edward Miller whose daughter Hannah is his wife— Mr Emmons married a daughter of Thomas Beale Wales, by Ann Beale sister of George W. Beale— Mr Emmons and Coll. Bigelow are both inhabitants of Boston, but are preparing for Summer residence at Quincy— I said to Mr Beale that I did not know what to ask for a gallery pew— He said he knew what it had cost me—50 dollars— I told him I should not ask more than that and the interest of the money.— I promised to look up my deeds of gallery pews and give speedily a definitive answer— I made an effort this day to resume the routine of my daily occupations broken up by the dissipations of Commencement week— I devoted the morning to the Journal of yesterday, and after dinner to writing two short Letters— One in answer to Calvin Colton who in a Letter dated New-York 28. August asks my permission to publish a paragraph of my last Letter to him of 25 August—concerning the Letter of John Rhea, in the imbecility of second childhood or bought with the money or promises of Andrew Jackson, affirming falsely the connivance of Mr Monroe with Jackson’s military Occupation of Florida in 1809.— Colton wants to disclose all the facts of this specimen of Jackson’s honour and honesty— Gouverneur also wishes the whole story divulged, but kept the secret during Jacksons life from motives of prudence and now keeps it still for fear of Jackson’s ghost— To all these transactions I was knowing only by correspondence. It is not for me to make myself busy for its publication. Jackson’s vengeful hatred of Monroe was stimulated by Monroes disavowal of his conquest of Florida.— His hatred of me was stimulated by my services in saving him from the public indignation—and he glutted his revenge upon us both in the same way, by spinning out of his own brain fictitious, and slanderous charges against us— If the metempsicosis of Pythagoras were a doctrine of Christian faith, the Soul of Andrew Jackson would be a derelict from the body of William the third of Orange, the glorious deliverer of Ireland—the murderer of the two De Witts, and the Hero of the battle of St. Denis, fought four days after the peace of Nimeguen— My other Letter was to William L. Marcy, Secretary of War, requesting that the name of Enos T. Dickerman of Stoughton may be entered on the books of the War Department as a Candidate for a Warrant of Cadet at the Military Academy at West point, for the 8th. Congressional District of Massachusetts in the appointments of 1846. and with this Letter I enclosed the 5 recommendatory documents which young Dickerman had left with me— Another evacuated Irish Shanty just below our orchard was set fire to, and burnt this evening. Miss Welsh stays with us this Night. "

He comes from Charleston South-Carolina, with certificates of conduct and character from white men of whom I know nothing, but who I suppose pass for respectable persons in that region— He comes from Charleston, because being free, having learnt to read and write, and being a taylor by trade he cannot live in that glorious exemplification of democracy the State of South-Carolina— He comes to settle in Massachusetts, and apprehensive of the prejudices against his colour in Boston, said his inclination was to fix himself in some small country town— I told him that I thought the prejudice against his colour would be more annoying to him in any country town than in Boston— That in country towns he would find very few if any of his own colour, with whom to associate, or from whom to derive countenance and support— In Boston he might exercise his trade and the people of his colour of whom there are many of respectable standing would afford him society and employment. He thanked me for the advice, and said that several of his friends in Boston had given him the same— This afternoon Mr Elliot C. Cowdin and Mr. F. A. Peterson came as a Committee in behalf of the Mercantile library association and requested me to deliver a lecture before that institution this autumn before the next meeting of Congress. I assured them it would give me great pleasure to comply with their request if possible; but I apprehended that it would not be in my power— They said if I would repeat any lecture that I had given heretofore elsewhere, it would give the company entire satisfaction, but I have an invincible repugnance to that— I have now on hand more than I can possibly perform for the present autumn— These gentlemen were however so urgent, that I requested them to call on me again about the 20th. of this and promised to give them then a definitive answer so far as may be in my power— To this they acceded.— Miss Welsh and Miss Henshaw were here this evening with Mrs Charles F. Adams— My wife has been several hours of each of the last 3 or 4 days, at Mrs T. B. Adams’s— Her decease is now hourly expected— I wasted this afternoon in fruitless search for my unfinished manuscript of a dissertation on the United States patent Laws— I return to 12.

It has several times since been attended with slighter indispositions perhaps this year superseded by my fits of lumbago through the month of June.— I presume that the shower bath which I have taken every morning from the 7th. of last month to this day has had considerable effect on the course of nature, and that the symptoms of gradual bodily decay are modified by it— Without actual sickness I have been several days not well, but not knowing what ails me— I went this morning to Boston with Harriet Welsh, and alighted at Amory Hall where we parted— She is going to England by the Steamer which is to sail on the first of next month to visit for one year Mr and Mrs Hodgkinson by their invitation.— Mrs Hodgkinson once Ann Hinckley is a beautiful native American, of adventures somewhat romantic but now soberly settled as the wife of a wealthy English Country Gentleman in England— Harriet Welsh is the last waif from the wreck of the family of Doctor Thomas Welsh whose wife Abigail Kent was a first cousin of my mother, and with whom I resided in Boston four of the most important years of my life from 1790 to 1794— I gave a sitting of two hours to Mr King the Sculptor whose progress in taking my bust is inconceivably slow and who to my judgment has not yet reached one feature of likeness to my face. I had agreed with Mr Healy to call on him at Mr Charles Hubbard painting room—N 11 1/2 Tremont row at 11. or 1/2 past 11. O’Clock— It was past 12 when I got there and learnt that Mr Healy was at Harding’s painting room in School-street where Page had painted me before— I went there, and at the door met the late President Quincy who told me that judge Story was lying at the point of death at Cambridge, not expected to survive this day. He had determined to resign his Office as a judge of the U.S. Supreme Court and to embark next month on a voyage to England— I sat to Mr Healy till the Old South Church Clock struck two, and then immediately returned to Quincy alone— I had agreed with Mr King and Mr Healy to give each of them another sitting next Friday— when I reached home my wife told me that Mrs Ann Adams, widow of my deceased brother Thomas Boylston Adams, died at 1. O’Clock this afternoon. Her disease was a cancer in the breast, for which she had submitted to an operation inwhich proved to be only a temporary remedy. She has been now more than 6. months lingering on her dying bed. Her children sent and requested me to write the obituary notice for the Quincy Aurora, and the Boston Newspapers to-morrow morning, and gave the latter to Mr. John Foster. Mrs. C. F. Adams and Miss Henshaw spent the Evening here. "

                "text": "4. IV:30. Thursday.  The Steamer Caledonia, Captain Lott, arrived at Boston yesterday morning, having left Liverpool on the 19th. of last month. Among her passengers are Dr. John Codman and Dr Francis Parkman. Mr Charles Swift and his son Henry Swift, residents at Germantown came to enquire if I could accommodate them with a loan of 2000 dollars, upon a temperance hotel which they propose to build in that part of Quincy—taking a mortgage upon the place. I told them that my son had the management of my affairs in this State, and knew better than myself, whether I have property to that amount of which this disposal could be made. He was now absent from home but I expected his return this evening—upon which I would ascertain from him whether I could accept their proposal, and would let them know. On my return from Boston yesterday, I found the five volumes of my miscellaneous writings, which I have collected to leave as a bequest to my Son, returned from the book binder Caleb Gill, handsomely bound in calf. There are Articles in Volume 1. 17. Vol. 2. 8. Vol 3. 14. Vol. 4. 24. Vol. 5. 28. in all 91. The first volume begins with the Oration delivered at Boston 4 July 1793. The 5th. volume closes with the Lecture on Society and civilization—chiefly written in 1822—but first delivered in 1840 and first published in the American Review of last July. The Article immediately preceding it is my Address to my Constituents of 2. April 1845— The space of time between the first and last of these publications is 52 years— The Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory 2. Volumes, and the Silesian Letters. 1. Volume are distinct publications not included in these. The Oration which I delivered at CambridgeJuly 1787. was published in a Magazine or Review at Philadelphia in September of that year of which I had at the time a copy but it has disappeared— The papers signed Publicola, in the Boston Centinel 1791. were republished in a pamphlet in England, but I was never able to procure a copy of it. Those of Marcellus, Columbus and Barnevelt were published only in the Boston Newspapers The report to the Senate in the case of John Smith, should have been in this collection, but whatever copies I had of it when published in 8vo. are lost. The correspondence with the British Government upon the Slaves carried away in violation of the Treaty of Ghent before the reference to the Emperor Alexander and sundry other diplomatic documents are yet missing, but this is the most complete, daguerrotype reflection of my mind, for more than half a century that ever has been or ever will be made— This evening my Son returned with his son John Quincy from his fishing excursion of 8 days to Holmes’s Hole— He comes back unwell with a sore throat and could not come down from the hill. Fuller went into Boston, and brought him out in the Carriage at 8 O’Clock in the Evening in a heavy shower. "

My Son came home last Night very ill, though it was not made known to me till this day— He had taken a severe cold last Tuesday at Holmes’s hole, and on Wednesday morning found himself seized suddenly with a violent cough, hoarseness, sore throat and fever— He remained however there till yesterday morning, when he returned by a Steamer to New-Bedford which he reached at Noon— There he was detained 3 hours to take the railway cars, and saw Mr Grinnell but could not visit his Lady. It was past 6 O’Clock when he arrived in the railway train from New-Bedford at Boston. He had written to his wife last Monday, giving notice that he proposed to come home on Thursday and requesting that Fuller might be sent to meet him at the depot of the Providence railroad with the Carriage at 5— p.m of yesterday— Fuller went accordingly; but it was half past 6. when the Cars arrived, and before coming out he went and took advice of Dr Bigelow, who directed him on reaching home to shut himself up and keep house for some days— From 6. O’Clock last evening till 8 when he arrived, I was in extreme uneasiness, fearing that some disastrous accident had befallen on him in the railway cars— He arrived in a shower of rain— The family of Mrs Ann Adams had depended upon him to make all the arrangements for her funeral this afternoon— In the delay of his arrival last evening, John Kirke came to me for directions. I named to him Thomas and Daniel Greenleaf—Lemuel Bracket, Josiah Brigham, George W. Beale and John Whitney, to be requested to serve as Pall-holders— When he came I directed Kirk to go up the hill and ask him to come and speak with me about the Pall holders— He sent me back word that he was somewhat fatigued; and that there was no occasion for Pallholders, the custom of having any at funerals being in this part of the country discontinued— This morning, under the depression of Spirits, of increasing tremulous debility, still encroaching upon my physical powers like the surge of a rising tide, I first learnt the illness of my Son. After an early dinner I went with my wife to his house, and found him with a hoarse cough and sore throat scarcely able to speak.— He was of course confined to his house. I went with my wife, Mrs John Adams, her daughter Mary-Louisa and Louisa C. Smith, to the house where Mrs. Ann Adams has resided since May 1829. and where she died— Many of her relatives of her own family and of ours, together with her neighbours of her late residence male and female were there assembled. The house was filled— Her daughter Elizabeth, her Son Isaac Hull Adams, and John Quincy Adams, her sisters Greenough Foster and Stebbins were there, and many other Friends and Acquaintance— The funeral service was performed by the Revd. William P. Lunt. The Coffin was transported in a Carriage to the grave yard without Pall bearers, and followed by a procession of mourners in Carriages and of friends and strangers on foot. It was deposited in the tomb bearing my name over its door. I walked home and spent the Evening at Charles’s and at my own house. "

On returning home on Wednesday I learnt that Mrs. Ann Adams had just died and that her interment was fixed for yesterday. It took place accordingly—and I could not fulfil my engagement to go to Boston— I went in this morning with Louisa C. Smith and my Grand-daughter Mary-Louisa. Leaving them at Mr James H. Foster’s, I walked first to Amory Hall, but Mr John C. King’s door was locked. I met in the street Mr Abbott Lawrence’s son James who told me that his father had returned from Sharon— I went next to Harding’s gallery in School-Street in search of Mr Healy, but he was not there and the door was closed. Then I went to my Son’s office 23. Court Street, where I found only Mr A. C. Spooner’s boy, Mr Spooner being gone to Plymouth.— I met also in the Street Dr John C. Warren— Then returning to Amory hall, I found Mr King, gave him a sitting of an hour, and a half, and engaged to come again next Tuesday— After another call at Harding’s gallery, without finding Mr Healy, I went to the Tremont house and enquired if he lodged there— He did not, but I was directed to the house in Beacon Street, the former dwelling house of David Sears.— On enquiry there he was gone out, and not expected till 3. O’Clock— I left word for him that I hoped to come again and to find him next Tuesday. I called finally at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s and saw Mrs Lawrence, Madame Calderon the wife of the Spanish Minister was visiting her with another Lady whose name I did not discover. I walked to Mr James H. Foster’s and reached the gate exactly as Fuller drew up to it with the Carriage— Miss Smith and Mary-Louisa were there and returned with me to Quincy to dinner— I went immediately to see my Son— Several of the pustules in his throat had broken and he was partly relieved from the symptoms of strangulation.— Isaac Hull Adams had come down to request me on the part of his mother’s family to request me to prepare the notes, to be read to-morrow morning at Meeting— Elizabeth C. Adams was unwilling to be named, and my Son was disinclined to put up a separate note for himself and his family— I wrote a note for myself my wife and my family, and called at Mr Lunt’s house and gave it to him— At my request he wrote a note for the children and Sisters of the late Mrs Ann Adams requesting prayers that the death of their mother and Sister may be sanctified to them— Mr Lunt approved the form of these two notes and thought they would be sufficient— I took them to the family at her late residence, and they all approved of them in these forms— The children are Elizabeth C. Isaac Hull and John Quincy Adams— The third son Joseph Harrod Adams is absent in the squadron on the pacific Ocean.— The Sisters and Mrs Greenough, Mrs Stebbins and Mrs Phineas Foster, all widows, and there are two brothers Joseph Harrod who resides at Portland, Maine, and Charles Harrod, for many years and still an inhabitant of New-Orleans— Isaac Hull Adams walked home with me to the eastern front yard gate but declined to come in.

                "text": "7. V. Sunday.  Mr Lunt preached this morning from Psalm 107.29. “He maketh the storm a calm.” I thought the discourse intended, as occasional, but written before hand with allusions to the recent decease of a parishioner, but so generalised as to suit for one person as well as for another— The subject was the efficacy of the Christian Religion to compose and tranquilize the storm of affliction raised by the decease of beloved relatives and friends— Its topics were consolatory, and its exhortations, reliance upon God in the exercise of Christian faith, as the only comforter in affliction with power and will to make the storm a calm— It was a spirited and eloquent discourse closing with a passage deeply pathetic— The text of his afternoon Sermon was from Matthew 8.29. “Art thou come hither to torment us before the time”—which at first struck me, as singular, its connection with the present occasion, or with the text of the morning, being in no wise apparent— But the morning text, from the Psalm, has espesian? to mariners at sea, to them that do business in the great waters, that go down to the sea in ships—they are described as in a storm, and it is to them that he maketh the storm a calm— The narrative in the 8th. chapter of Matthew, is of an occasion when Jesus Christ was embarked in a ship, when a great tempest arose and the ship and all on board were in imminent danger of perishing— He was asleep— His disciples awoke him and implored him to save them—v. 26. [“]And he saith unto them, why are ye fearful, o ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm”— Now this is precisely the power ascribed to the Lord, in the 29th verse of the 107th. Psalm—and there is a manifest harmony between the two passages— But this verse was not the one selected by Mr Lunt for his afternoon text— He took it from the narrative of a subsequent miracle when he had landed from the ship and come into the Country of the Gergesenes, and met with two men possessed by devils, whom he cast out and drove into a heard of swine— These were the evil Spirits, who being yet in the men, who cried out, what have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? “Art thou come hither to torment us before the time”? And these were the words chosen by Mr Lunt for the text to his afternoon Sermon— What was the connection between this strange speech of the devils to Jesus recognizing him as the Son of God, and the assertion in the Psalm, that the Lord maketh the storm a calm, or the fact related in the 8th. Chapter of Matthew that Jesus Christ did actually make a storm a calm, on the Sea of Galilee? What is it but the principle that the same power which controuls the elements of physical nature is equally sufficient to controul the passions of animated nature, and the spiritual soul of men—“which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the People[”]— A philosophical truth—that the universe is governed by a reasoning mind and a rational will— Ex-President Quincy came out this morning from Cambridge, and after the day’s service, walked with me to the two railway bridges at the corner near my house— He told me he should remove from Cambridge to Boston with his family to-morrow. Mr Lunt read this morning the notes as we had agreed upon them last Evening— Southwest gale blowing all day— Evening shower, with distant thunder and lightening. My Son confined to his house. "

                "text": "8. V. Monday  My Son continues ill—confined to his house with an ulcerated sore throat, and my own condition foreshows a time at hand, when I shall lose the power of writing altogether, and in a great measure the use of my hands. My reflections on this state of things, may best remain within my own bosom. This hand writing speaks for itself of the present and the future. I shake like an aspen leaf. After breakfast, I walked toMarsh the Shoemaker; and bespoke a pair of winter shoes— He gave me some Dix and Cushing pears. I called at the Post and left the Letter for James S. Wallace Editor of the Philadelphia Gazette in answer to his inquiry when the stars and the stripes were adopted as the flag of the United States— I asked the Postmaster French if there was not a mail for me— He said yes—a large one, and gave it to me— There was a Letter from Coll. Joseph G. Totten chief engineer in answer to mine of the 1st. instt. to the Secretary of War requesting that the name of Enos T. Dickerman of Stoughton might be entered as a Candidate for a Cadet’s warrant at West-point, in June 1846. from the 8th. congressional district of Massachusetts— Coll. Totten acknowledges the receipt of the 5 recommendatory documents and informs me that the name will be presented to the Secretary of War as a Candidate in February or March next when the appointment will be made— There was a Letter from William Gowans of New-York, with a copy of Denton’s description of New-York, formerly New Netherlands 1670. a very thin pamphlet rather than volume in pages of 8vo. size, but printed on large 4to. paper, being the first number of a collection of works under the title of Gowans’s Bibliotheca Americana which he proposes to republish. Mr Gowans in his very obliging Letter, intimates a desire for my opinion upon his undertaking which I consider highly useful— I answered immediately his Letter warmly approving his undertaking, and offering my hearty good wishes for his success in the prosecution of it— The only doubt that I entertain concerning it is whether a sufficient interest in these antient colonial memorials can be excited in the reading public of this Country to pay for the expence of costly editions of them.— There was a note from Mr George Peter Alexander Healy regretting the failure of our appointment for last Friday, and proposing to me to call on him again next Wednesday morning at half past 11—and there were sundry Newspapers— Returning home I called at my Son’s house, and found him still suffering severely with his ulcerated sore throat. I went there again about Sunset, and met there Dr Woodward—several of the pustules in the throat had broken but others yet remained to be dispersed— There was an alarm of fire soon after dark. My wife was at Charles’s great part of the day—we both came home early in the evening, with heavy hearts, and humble hopes and fervent prayers with which I closed the day. "

I went into Boston this morning, for variation of the scene, for occupation of the mind and exercise of the body—to scatter obtrusive thoughts, and seek refuge from unwelcome forebodings— Louisa C. Smith and my Granddaughter Mary Louisa went with me— I left them at James H. Foster’s and went to Mr King’s working room at Amory Hall. I gave him a sitting of an hour and a half, and asked him how many more he would want. He said three—and I agreed with him to come again for one of the three; and if possible next Saturday for the second— I called at Hardings gallery in School Street, but Mr Healy was not there— At his lodgings in Beacon Street but neither was there— I left word for him that I would meet him at half past 11 to-morrow morning at Harding’s gallery. I met in the street judge C. H. Warren who told me that he had another Letter from my father to Coll. James Warren his grandfather of which he would send me a copy— At my son’s office I found Mr A. C. Spooner who had just returned from Plymouth— Mr Abbott Lawrence I found at his Counting house in Milk-street— I left with him President Quincy’s answer to my letter of enquiry of 19. May last, with a copy of my Letter and sundry documents appended to the answer all which I requested him and he promised to read— I said we had two arduous duties to discharge—one was to address the contributors to the Observatory, and call upon them for a new contribution for a fund to support the observer and his assistants and subordinates—and the other to prepare a report as a Committee of the board of overseers to be submitted to them at their meeting during the Session of the Legislature next January— And that the satisfactory discharge of this second duty would depend very much upon the successful result of the first— Mr Lawrence mentioned the course which he thought it would be best to take for raising the contribution, and I promised to see him again as soon as he shall have read President Quincy’s communications.— I took up Louisa C Smith and Mary-Louisa at Mr James H. Foster’s, and we returned to Quincy to dine. After dinner I went up the hill to see my Son, who is yet confined to the house, with his illness— Mr Beale came in while I was there, and spoke of the gallery pews in the stone Temple which he wanted to purchase for Mr Emmons and Mr George T. Bigelow— Two for each— He had agreed to give 60 dollars for the corresponding pews 45 for the front and 15 for the back pew, and would give the same for mine—to which I agreed— He spoke also of the small strip of my land wanted to square off Mr Emmons’s houselot; and without specifying terms I declared my disposition for all reasonable accommodation I received a Letter, from William Jackson of Newton enclosing one from Joshua S. Green a missionary at the Sandwich Islands dated the 10th. of March 1845— Towards Sunset I went to Charles’s house again, and at dusk returned. "

My whole life from the 5th. of March 1770 the night of the Boston Massacre, is an Arabian tale, strip’d of the marvellous.— Every thing simple—nothing extraordinary— No adventure—yet all to my present imagination romantic— Miss Harriet Welsh came in for a few minutes while I was under the hands of the painters— Fuller came for me shortly before half past one. My Grandson, John Quincy from School was with him. We took up Miss Smith at Mr James H. Foster’s and returned to Quincy to dine— My wife was confined to her chamber— After dinner I went to my Son’s house He is yet severely ill— Mrs Frothingham and her son Thomas came while I was there but I saw only the Son— My occupations almost fail to operate as a diversion to my Spirits Judge Joseph Story of the Supreme Court of the United States, died this Evening.

Beautiful autumnal weather— But autumn is like Spring with dewy fingers cold— Even in the mid day sun, I cease not to shiver with the cold of the morning— My Journal henceforth can be no more than a record of suffering, and must very soon cease from physical disability to continue it— I still rise shortly after 4. and this morning took my shower bath with a shrinking body— Without so much flinching I used the horse hair mittens and girdle, till after Sunrise, but was still trembling with cold. I lighted up on my chamber hearth the torn up covers of Letters and newspapers which have been gathering up in the 3 fireless months, which made a light fire, and we had a fire in the dining room the whole day— For exercise I took my hoe, and dug up weeds in the garden and nursery an hour or more, till I was thoroughly warm and in gentle perspiration— I received a Letter from our old Secretary of the Ghent Negotiation Christopher Hughes dated at Sea, on board the Steamer Great Western the 3d. of this month with a Postscript of the 9th. arrived at New-York, returning home from his last mission to Holland, with his daughter— He has been one of the most constant of my friends; and his own life has been one of numerous vicissitudes. 33 years of uninterrupted public service, but scarcely ever three years together at the same place or in the same station— I received also a Letter, signed S. E. Sewell, H. B. Stanton, J. M. Whiton, J. N. Barbour, M. S. Scudder and E. Wright junr—Committee of Arrangements for calling a convention to assemble at Boston on the 1st. of October from all the free States on the eastern slope of the Alleghenies to devise means for the advancement of the cause of freedom in the United States; earnestly inviting me to attend this convention and participate in its deliberations— My own inclinations almost irresistible are to accept this invitation, and take a decided and leading part in its proceedings— But I am literally palsied—on the verge of the grave, and have neither body nor mind to go through with the work.— I must not go— Another Letter from John G. Palfrey making several enquiries concerning Joseph Nourse, of whose history he has some erroneous ideas and some ignorance— It will require patience, caution, and research to rectify his misconceptions in this case. I had before received from Marshall P. Wilder President of the Massachusetts horticultural Society an invitation to the exhibition of Fruits and Flowers by the Society on the 17th. 18th. and 19th. of this month, and cards of admission for myself and my wife to the festival of the 19th. We had visits this day from Mr and Mrs Waterston, from Ann and Caroline Beale and Louisa Wales— I received Letters from Mrs. A Campbell for Elizabeth C. Adams and Mrs Greenough— I walked over this afternoon, and delivered them. Mrs John and Mrs Charles went and invited Elizabeth C Adams to take a ride with them but she declined. I was twice at my Son’s house this afternoon. He is better, but very slowly convalescent. "

After going through the usual morning process of washing and rubbing, including the shower bath, I walked up the hill to my Son’s house and saw the rising Sun. I then took my hoe into my nursery, and dug up weeds about an hour, till I warmed myself into a perspiration, but could not steady my hand— I had visitors; the Revd. Mr Ripley from Vermont—the Revd. Bradley Miner Minister of a Baptist church at Neponset village, another Mr Miner his brother, and Dr Orin P. Bacon Post master at the Neponset village Post-Office. These were succeeded by the Revd. Mr Lunt, Pastor of the Quincy stone temple church; and he by Alexander Taverns and his wife Jane Taverns, a fine coloured couple from Washington three fourths white— This Alexander served us at Washington about 2 months as a waiting man, till he fell sick and was obliged to leave us— But I had forgotten him— Their object in visiting this part of the country now, is to raise a contribution of 600 dollars to purchase the freedom of his or her Sister Norah, a Slave whose tender hearted master or mistress generously consents to emancipate her for that sum— In the uncertain and alarming state of my health and especially of my mind, I endeavour as much as possible to occupy every moment of time that I can command with bodily exercise or with writing, but I am now so debilitated that the whole day is absorbed in making out one page of Journal, and I am not able to add to it the daily short answer to a Letter— My correspondence reduced as it is suffers accordingly— The Letter from the Revd. Jonathan S. Green, the missionary to the Sandwich Islands, enclosed to me by William Jackson of Newton calls for an answer, as does the enclosing Letter from Jackson himself; but I could not find time to write either of them this day.— I hunted over the journals of the revolutionary Congress in search of answers to the enquiries of Mr John G. Palfrey concerning Joseph Nourse— I found at last on the Journal of 28. November 1777. an order for the payment of his Salary for half a year from 10. May to 10. November 1777. as deputy Secretary to the board of War— Richard Peters was the Secretary.— This was the first introduction of Joseph Nourse to the public service— His subsequent appointments during the Confederation Congress I had not time to ascertain. One of Mr Palfrey’s enquiries is about what time he died, and my recollection does not enable me to answer it. I hunted over the Journals of the house of Representatives of the United States for the time, when the petition of his widow was substituted for his own, for satisfaction of the judgment which he obtained in the Circuit Court of the United States for a balance due to him on the settlement of his accounts—one suit instituted against him as a defaulter— I traced his own petition to the Journal of 1834. when a bill, in his favour was reported by the Committee of Claims. I found his petition again, in 1838 but in the midst of my researches night came on and superseded them till a future day. "

Now, all was changed— Mr Saltonstall and judge Story were dead— Texas is a part of the Union.— A new foundation for party movements must be laid— Yesterday Mr Webster had sent him a message that he wished an interview with him, on the old foundation of unrestricted confidence, which he had accepted— And he wanted further conversation with me on this subject— I found my Son this evening still slowly convalescent— "

                "text": "14. V. Sunday  There was a relaxation of the rigour of the thermometer, with a sucession of light showers all day, and afternoon a stiff gale hardly amounting to a tempest— A gleam of light at the setting of the Sun, promised a fairer day to-morrow.— I cannot excuse myself for noticing so often and so much in this journal from day to day the state of the weather—but in the last stage of human life, in old age, the weather forms a large portion of life itself— I made a regular fire in my chamber this morning, with a large log, which has been waiting on the hearth from some time in June, but which this day reduced to two large conical brands— We had fires also in the dining room, and in my wife’s chamber— Neither the shower bath, nor the other ablutions or frictions were intermitted, but all to little purpose for my ability to write. I rode to meeting with Louisa C. Smith Mrs Charles and her three elder boys. Mr Lunt’s morning text was from Philippians 2.12 [“]work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” The discourse was upon the influences of the holy spirit or holy ghost upon the heart and conduct of Christians—and he said that the exhortation necessarily implied that the power of working out his own salvation was in every individual believer, in as much as if it was not there could be no occasion for exhortation, nor use in it—and the reason for the exhortation, because God himself by his holy Spirit worketh on the Soul of Man imports a promise of the influence of the divine Spirit in aid of the honest and humble efforts of the Christian to work out his own salvation— There is something encouraging and consolatory in this doctrine, which I need as I approach the close of life— Mr Lunt said that in the New Testament especially there were three distinct manifestations of the Supreme Creator of the Universe under the denominations of God the father the Son and the Holy Ghost— By a large portion a majority of the Christian churches they were understood to be distinct persons though not with separate corporeal forms— The third of these persons called the holy Spirit or holy Ghost, was that emanation of the divinity which wrought internally upon the heart of man, and enabled him with fear and trembling to work out his own Salvation— I walked home with a sprinkling of rain; but it grew to a storm in the afternoon and I rode to and from the temple to attend the service— Mr Lunt’s afternoon text was from John 9.25 “He answered, and said, whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know; that whereas I was blind, now I see.” This was the miracle of the blind man restored to sight, which the Pharisees attempted to turn to reproach as a violation of the Sabbath— There was something of the spirit of the morning’s discourse in the Sermon of the afternoon— The special motive for this miracle, besides the blessing, bestowed upon the man, the going about, doing good, seems to have been to accredit the mission of the Saviour, in despite of the opposition of the pharisees— Mr Lunt’s lesson from it was the duty of the Christian was to pray that the gospel of Christ may operate upon the heart of every sinner to make the same acknowledgment—one thing I know; that, whereas I was blind, now I see— After church, the storm continuing, I called for a few minutes to see my Son, still confined, but better, and came home.

The labour of the day was to bring up the journal from Friday, and that was all that I was able to accomplish— I could not write the daily Letter— I received from Elliot C. Cowdin, one of the young man who a few days since applied to me to deliver a Lecture before the Mercantile Library association a Report of the board of Directors made in June last, from the origin of the institution in 1820 to its incorporation in 1845— The object of this institution originally was to collect a library suitable for the reading of a merchant, by the associated funds of the merchants clerks in Boston. Their beginnings were small—their numbers few—their contributions scanty. But they have maintained their organization under repeated modifications, for 25 years— They began with a board of seven directors annually chosen, which they afterwards increased to thirteen, then reduced to ten and again to 9 with a President— They have also an anniversary Oration and Poem, delivered sometimes by members of the Society and at others by strangers under special invitation.— After much deliberation they rejected the proposal to have a supper with their anniversary Oration and Poem— They have also introduced annual courses of Lectures every winter for a series of years and made repeated applications to me to deliver one of them, but I have never been able to comply with their invitation, and am now more unable then ever. After 25 years of a variegated and fluctuating fortune they have at last at the Session of this present year of the Legislature of this Commonwealth obtained an act of incorporation, and it is a sore disappointment to me to be disabled from delivering a Lecture before them. I went to the Post-Office, and left the Boston Evening Gazette of last Saturday for my Granddaughter Louisa Catherine, at Mr Charles Sedgwick at Lenox and a Letter for Miss Cutts to the care of Governor Fairfield at Saco, Maine and in returning home stop’d at my Son’s house to see him— I called again as the Sun was setting and the full moon rising, with a disk apparently larger than that of the Sun himself— How uniform is the course of Nature! how mutable the condition of man! The Sun and Moon rise and set now as they did five thousand years ago— I take pleasure in seeing the rising and setting of the Sun—and of the full moon—so I did fifty years ago—but with what a different sensation!— In youth, in manhood, even in green old age—the rising and setting Sun and moon, speak at once of God and of the lapse of time— Carpe diem is their Lesson—but what is it in extreme old age? what is it when the faculties of body and Soul, are in the last stage of decay? palsied— It is never too late to learn—but the last Lessons are without hope?— that must come from another quarter— In pursuit of Mr John G Palfrey’s enquiries about Joseph Nourse, I found that on the 19th. of September 1781. he was appointed by the confederation Congress Register of the Treasury—under an Ordinance for regulating the Treasury, and adjusting the public accounts—of the 11th. of that month. And on the 11th. of September 1789. President Washington nominated him as Register (in Office) of the Treasury "

                "text": "17. IV. Wednesday—  Sun rose 5.41. in line with the urn?— Set 6.9.  I awoke just before the entry clock struck 2. and lay awake as I supposed till hearing it strike 4. I remembered that I had not heard it strike 3. I was therefore then asleep with a consciousness of being awake— On rising I took the 41st. daily shower bath, and the last for the present Season— Then went up the hill, and from the corner of Charles’s house saw the rising Sun—and then came down, took my hoe, and dug up weeds at the bottom of my Nursery, for about an hour producing a mild but sensible perspiration— I then sat down at my writing desk and attempted to write. With what success the two preceding pages may shew— They are the arduous and scarcely intermitted labour of the whole day— The involuntary shaking of my right hand makes it a herculean labour to shape letters into words upon paper.— How far my own sins have to answer before heaven for this premature impotence to perform the great labour and duty of life, I must leave my merciful maker to determine— My practice of rising at 4. O’Clock in the morning was commenced in the Summer of 1796. at the Hague— I had never before been an early riser upon principle, though I had been taught from a child that early to bed and early to rise was the way to be healthy, wealthy and wise— I had been very late to bed and late to rise the preceding winter and spring at London— Returned to the Hague, and no longer stimulated by the same motive to sit up late, I chanced to read in an English Review of the Life of John Wesley, the founder of the episcopal Methodist church a statement that at a certain period of his life he formed the deliberate determination to rise every morning at 4. O’Clock. That the morning after coming to this resolution he commenced the practice, and continued it through his whole life— Profoundly struck with this narrative, the first thing I said to myself was—what John Wesley accomplished, cannot I undertake? I was not sure of my performance; but I thought I could try it for a time— I began it by going to bed in June 1796. at the Hague before 9 O’Clock in the Evening— I slept sound, and after a refreshing night awoke and rose with the Sun— The experiment was cheering; I continued it through the Summer and autumn and when winter came with its long and cold nights, I still took to an early bed with provision made for a lamp to be lighted and a fire to be kindled at four O’Clock the next morning. The fiftieth year has now commenced since I went through this process, and I rose this morning, at 4. O’Clock, and lighted my lamp and kindled my fire— I have not perhaps so inflexibly adhered to the rising hour of four as he did, but the average of my rising hour for the fifty years has not exceeded half past 4. One consequence has been that the hours before breakfast have been the most contented the most active and most efficient hours of the day— My habitual practice of Summer Sea and river bathing and swimming began much later, and I have of late years been obliged to abandon them altogether— The Shower bath was my last resource and I must now give up that— The jar is too racking, and I can not recover the composure of the hand through the day— Charles went into Boston and brought out his Son John Quincy.

                "text": "18. IV Thursday.  I omitted this morning the shower bath, from a belief most unwillingly ripening to conviction—that it shakes my nerves beyond their power of Endurance, and disables me from writing almost entirely. I devoted however the morning hours to my usual morning exercises, saw the Sun rise from My Son’s house and dug up weeds in my Nursery till I was warm. My Son took his son John Quincy to school at Boston, departing at half past six to be at the opening of the school at 8— I sent for my barber then, who came and shaved me; and Gillet came and took me up in his stage at 8. At half past 9 he landed me at Amory Hall in Boston— The Stage was full but I knew none of my fellow passengers.— Mr King had not yet got in from his lodgings at Roxbury— I went to Mr Abbott Lawrence’s counting house in Milk Street and had an hour of conversation with him— First upon the papers relating to the observatory—with regard to these he is in consultation with Samuel A. Eliot the Treasurer of the University, and with Bowditch, and they have not yet fixed upon the plan of operations to be pursued to raise the fund of 50000 dollars, for the salary of an observer, and the incidental current expenses of the establishment; but he thought they would be prepared at our next meeting on Saturday, when he engaged me to dine with him again.— O that I may be able to discharge my duty in this concern! Secondly Mr Lawrence gave me to read the Letter of Daniel Webster to Nathan Appleton of 8. August last— It is an answer to one from Appleton to him of the 4th. of the same month, in which he had expressed a hope that the relations of Friendship and cordiality which had formerly subsisted between Webster and Lawrence might be restored— Webster declares his willingness and earnest desire that this may be effected; and with regard to the past, that by-gones may be considered as bygones— Mr Lawrence’s answer, addressed to Appleton, and dated the 13th. of this month accepts this proposition purely and simply repeating Websters words that by-gones are to be considered as by-gones— The intimate and cordial personal relations heretofore existing between Mr Webster and Mr Lawrence are thus restored; but it is very apparent that confidences between them never can be restored— All Webster’s political systems are interwoven with the exploration of a gold mine for himself and all his confidential intimacies with Lawrence have been devices to screw from him or by his agency from others, money by the fifty or hundred thousand dollars at a time— Mr Lawrence further told me, that Louis M’Lane when recently here to embark in the Steamer as Minister to England told him that when Lord Ashburton arrived here for the negotiation of the Treaty, Tyler sent for him M’Lane, and offered him the Department of State, with the commission to negotiate with Lord Ashburton, and to turn Webster out of the Department of State for that purpose. I returned to Amory Hall and sat an hour to Mr King. Then passed into school-Street and sat in Harding’s Gallery to Mr Healy and Mr Dubourjal, till ten minutes past one, when my Son called for me, and I returned with him, in the curricle to Quincy to dine— We had scarcely dined when four gentlemen named Washburn, Putnam, Millard and Bates called on me; all strangers, and whose only purpose was to hold half an hour of miscellaneous conversation— I passed the remainder of the afternoon in the torture of writing, and after a short visit to Mrs Charles at Sunset closed the Evening at home.

A longing lingering hope that a persevering use of the shower bath would ultimately alleviate the shaking of my nervous system, allured me to repeat the experiment this morning, after having yesterday renounced it yesterday for the short remnant of my days— It gave me no relief but aggravated for the early part of the day that universal trembling which disables me for writing. Yet by dint of extreme exertion, I got through the journal of yesterday before dinner, and after dinner, having attempted without success to take a short Siesta. I answered John G. Palfrey’s Letter of enquiries concerning Joseph Nourse— He held the Office of Register of the Treasury from the 19th. of September 1781. to the1829. when he was removed by President Andrew Jackson and Thomas L. Smith was appointed in his place— Jackson not only removed him but it was said insulted him when he applied to know the cause of his removal, by telling him that it was his old age, and that it was time for him to be making his preparation for another world.— He also ordered a prosecution of him as a defaulter on the Settlement of his accounts; the case was tried in the Circuit Court of the United States, and the verdict of the jury found a large balance due to Nourse—the judgment of the Court was conformable to the verdict of the jury, and was on appeal confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States— Mr Nourse then petitioned Congress for payment of the balance which upon judicial investigation had been found due to him. On the 19th. of May 1832 the judiciary Committee of the Senate reported a Bill in his favour— On the 29th. of March 1834 the Committee of claims of the House of Representatives did the same; and at every Session of Congress from that time until his death in 1842—one of these bills was before one or the other house—always defeated by the democratic party— After his death the claim was pursued by his widow Maria L. Nourse with the same issue until her death last year—and at the last Session of Congress, a petition from his son and legal representative shared the same fate— All this forms no part of the enquiries of Mr Palfrey nor of my answers to them— They were of the Offices held by Mr Nourse, and about the time of his death— This I ascertained, by the petition of his widow to the House of Representatives which was presented by Daniel D. Barnard on the 14th. of Decr 1842. This afternoon Mr N. W. Coffin came with my Son, and delivered to me a Letter from Joseph Bell Chairman of the whig State central committee inviting me to attend at a whig convention to be held at Boston next Wednesday morning, and to preside at the Meeting— I declined very reluctantly on the ground of disability by the state of my health—and I was compelled to give the same answer to Messrs. Cowdin and Humphries the Committee from the Mercantile Library Association on their invitation to deliver a Lecture before them. "

I left home with my granddaughter Mary-Louisa at half past 8 for Boston— It sprinkled as we entered the Carriage, and poured with rain before we reached the railway bridge, this side of the Neponset— The appearance of the sky threatened a stormy day, and I ordered Fuller to turn back and return home— This premature yielding to frowning skies proves my nature to be in the last stage of decadence never before should I thus have given way— On alighting at home I directed Fuller to put up the horses in the stable, and if the weather should clear up, to be ready to start again. And so it did in the course of an hour— We took a second departure and at 11. O’Clock, I left Mary Louisa at Dr. Frothinghams’s door in Summer Street— I drove to Amory Hall and gave a last sitting of an hour to Mr King the Sculptor— He is well satisfied with his own work, and says that it has been approved as a likeness by numerous visitors.

These are different from them all— There is a delusion in them— They are true as a mirror— Tableaux parlans.— When you look at them you feel as if they were speaking to you. My own will be fearfully like—for my countenance does injustice in my old age to my heart— It was not so when Parker painted me in 1795—and Copley in 1796. It was not so when van Huffel painted me at Ghent in January 1815—or Leslie at London in September 1816.— My sufferings since that time from the injustice of some of my cotemporaries, from declining health and from the destroyer Time have furrowed my brow, and distorted my face, till my naturally tender heart has almost become a petrifaction. I dined again at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s, with his family, Mrs. Joseph Angier—Miss Rotch, and Miss Clara Dabney, daughter of Charles W. Dabney late and long Consul to the Azore Islands residing at Fayal, and recently removed by President James K. Polk— Mr Lawrence gave me all the papers relating to the Observatory, and I promised to see him again and dine with him next Tuesday. At a quarter past 4 Fuller came with the Carriage and took us home to Quincy, where we landed just at Sunset. Charles’s son John Quincy came home in Gillet’s Stage. "

                "text": "21. IV. Sunday.  Sun rose 5.45. Set 6.2  I finally dispensed with the Shower bath, and with it left hope for bodily comfort on earth henceforth behind— I could not write, and a boil on the fourth finger of my left hand with other corresponding symptoms gave me warning of the condition of my blood— Mr Lunt is gone for an excursion of ten days to New-York, and Dr Kendall of Plymouth supplied his pulpit this day— His morning text was from Acts 3.26. [“]Unto you, first, God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.” These words are part of the discourse of Peter to the people, on the performance of the second miracle by the Apostles after the death of Jesus, by healing the lame man in Solomon’s porch at the gate of the Temple. He reminds them that Jesus whom they had ignorantly rejected and executed had been sent by God, first to them, to bless them by turning away every one of them [“]from his iniquities”— Dr Kendall’s argument from this was that the object of Christ’s Mission upon earth was to bless all mankind, by revealing to them the immortality of their Souls and a state of future retribution; turning away every one from his iniquities, whereby the future world may offer to them a State of glorious reward— I invited him to dine with us but he had previously engaged to dine with Mrs Lunt. It rained almost the whole day—and I rode to and from meeting, morning and afternoon— The auditory both parts of the day was very small— The text of the afternoon discourse was Psalm 72.6. “He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.”— This Psalm is announced in its title to be for Solomon; and it closes also with a declaration that the prayers of David the Son of Jesse are ended. It would seem as if it was composed immediately before his death, in a Spirit at once of prophesy, and of supplication.— As if in his last hour his whole soul was absorbed in the contemplation of the happy and glorious futurity for the People of God, under the rule and dominion of his Son and successor Solomon— He begins by the invocation of Jehovah— “Give the king, thy judgments, O God! and thy righteousness unto the kings Son”— And then he describes in oriental imagery the blessings which his reign shall shower down upon the people—and it is remarkable that of all the topics upon which he glorifies by anticipation the administration of Solomon, that upon which he most emphatically dwells, is his deliverance of the poor and needy from the oppressor— This Psalm is considered also, as referrin prophetically to the reign of the Messiah upon earth and the consumation of Christianity. There is a force of expression, applied to the predicted glory and power of the king’s Son, which could scarcely be justified by the transient and fading splendours of the reign of Solomon.— Dr Kendall is a preacher of the old unitarian school—a graduate at Harvard of 1796.—and there is a striking difference both of style, and of argument between the divines of that period, the close of the last century and the modern pupils of the divinity school since instituted. Dr Kendall took tea with us, and soon after returned to Mr Lunt’s to pass the Night and return to Plymouth to-morrow My condition at Night is as it was in the morning. The task before me is to accommodate the few remaining hours of my life to that condition. "

Yet I sleep little at Night, and after hearing the morning clock strike two, three and four I find it irksome to lie longer in bed— I rise, and am yet able to wash and dress and make my fire—privileges of which soon—I know not how soon I am to be deprived— To all exertions of my own for protracting the day of absolute impotence and death, I must bid a last adieu— But I yet invoke the blessing of my Maker— I recur to the proceedings in the episcopal ritual on the Visitation of the sick; and here I meet the infirmities all involuntary of my Faith— I feel my responsibility for my own sins, but I cannot believe that any other man, and especially that any priest, can have power to pardon or absolve them, nor that the could be atoned for by the crucifixion of Jesus Christ two thousand years before I was born. I repeat with fervent supplication the 9th. verse of the 71st. Psalm— “Cast me not off, in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth”—and the 18th. Now also, when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not—for I believe there is a God who heareth prayer, and that honest prayer to him will not be in vain— Well I know that he will not supersede his general laws of physical nature for me— But he in his own time and his own way can redeem, and reward my Spirit, and to him I direct my prayer and commit my Soul— Early this morning Doctor Granville Ware Gay, came with a paper signed, by several of the most respectable citizens of Quincy, addressed to the Directors of the Old Colony rail-road, which will run by our house, and earnestly recommending his brother—Henry A. Gay to be superintendent of the Rail-road depot, in our neighbourhood.— This recommendation the signers to which pledge themselves to the good character and capacity of him whom they recommend, Dr Gay invited me to sign which I declined on the principle of a long settled rule, never to sign recommendations of character and capacity, in favour of persons, of whom I have no personal knowledge. I said I had great confidence in the opinions and testimony of the Gentlemen who had signed the recommendation, and had no doubt it was well deserved, but I could never feel myself justified in signing a certificate of character in behalf of a person, whom I did not know— Dr Gay declared himself fully satisfied with this answer, and avowed his approbation of my rule. I devoted this day to retrieving the arrears of this journal without entirely succeeding— I lose a day whenever I go in to Boston and then have two days to record in one. My Son went in this morning and returned to dine. He saw Edward Everett, and his family, who are now at the City house of Mr. Peter C. Brooks— He visited also at Mrs Lekain’s in Summer Street Mr John Greig of Canandaigua, whom I specially remember from July 1843. He went to England about 3 months since in one of the Steamers, and returned last Friday in the Hibernia, a fellow passenger with Edward Everett and his family— Two days before landing his foot was scalded with boiling water and he is now laid up on a Sopha— Charles and his wife passed the Evening with us.— My finger was this evening so much inflamed and swollen, that I applied to it a bread and milk poultice for the Night. My complaint in the throat continues obstinate, alternating outside and in, and not leaving me an hour of quiet— "

Wednesday  The progress of my paralytic affection has brought me to the point of a physical impossibility to continue my daily journal, as I have kept it with a few occasional interruptions for more than half a century— I shall cease henceforth the attempt to record the daily page of my life, and abide with resignation to the will of my maker, his final dispensations of my existence upon earth— Of my remnant of days the journal can scarcely have interest even for my own posterity— I read Psalm 90: [“]The days of our years are three score years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be four score years yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we fly away”— I approach the term of four score— I cannot desire exemption from the lot of humanity, and have but to submit to my destiny— Yet struggling to the last, I was occupied nearly the whole of this day in retrieving the arrears of the two preceding days which I barely accomplished— We received visits from Mr Thomas C Love—of Buffalo—heretofore a member of Congress (the 24th) from the State of New-York—with his son, and unmarried daughter, Mr Soper of Batavia, Mrs Soper, and a Mr Smith of Boston. Mr Love is and has been ever since I have known him a warm whig, and while in Congress was with his family on the most friendly terms with me and mine.— In the Summer, and again in the late autumn of 1843 when I was at Buffalo, he came to greet me at Niagara, and I visited him at his own house— I saw Mr Soper at Batavia in July 1843. and he reminded me of the good fortune which saved me there from fractured limbs if not from loss of life from the breaking down of a platform in front of the door of the house where I was received— (27. July) Mr Soper says he was the person who saved me from the fall, by help me to step from the platform, at the very moment of the crash— To these visitors succeeded a person named De Israel, a German Jew, who says he has been residing twelve years in this Country, at New-Orleans, at Natchez in Mississippi, at Cincinnati, Ohio, and at New-York, and now comes in extreme indigence with a recommendatory certificate from Mr John Pickering, and the Revd. Dr Jenks, to enquire if I could procure for him a class of pupils for a teacher of modern languages, as French and German, or of Hebrew. It was not in my power to give him this assistance, and after dining with us, he proceeded to seek for the minister of the episcopal church in this place the Revd. Mr Clark for whose residence he had enquired— I received a notification from Joseph Willard Recording Secretary of the Massachusetts Historical Society, of a meeting of the Society to-morrow, with an invitation of communications from the respective members of the 2d. Section pursuant to the rules adopted at the April Meeting 1844. My Son and Mr Davis the Architect were here this evening; but the weather was lowering and Mrs Charles did not come— The condition of my health continues as monetary and discouraging as it has been at any period of my life.

Nicholas Murray, Minister of the 1st. Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth-town, New-Jersey, urging again with great earnestness my attendance on Monday the 24th. of next November at the ceremony of erecting the monument in honour of the Revd. James Caldwell— Day after day crowds upon me the conviction that neither my bodily nor my mental powers will bear me out in making the attempt.— With Mr Murray’s Letter are enclosed one to me from W. A. Irvine of Septr. 7. 1845. transmitting to me copies of two Letters from his grandfather General William Irvine to his wife, dated 14 and 18 June 1780. in one of which mention is made of the shooting down of Mrs Caldwell with an infant in her arms. I had already received the small volume of Notes concerning Elizabethtown, by Mr Murray, published in 1844. Another Letter, of a different character was from John Howland President of the Historical Society of Rhode-Island—returning the medal which at the request of Commodore Jesse D. Elliot I had forwarded to them—and with it two copies of a Resolution of the Society requesting me to return the medal to Commodore Elliot— The course for me to pursue in this case must be subject of cool reflection— I went to Boston this morning with Louisa C. Smith and Mrs Charles— Leaving Miss Smith at Mr James H. Foster’s, and Mrs Charles at Dr Frothingham’s I called at Dr. Bigelow’s house to consult him, but he was not at home— I then went and sat an hour from 11 to 12 to Mr Healy and Mr Dubourjal— They had hitherto painted me in a black silk Stock— But at the last sitting, Mr Healy requested me to come this day with a white cravat which I did— At noon I left them and went and attended the monthly meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society— There were but two members of the second Section of the Society present, and neither of whom had any communication to make— The only subject acted upon was a Resolution or Resolutions of the Legislature of the State of Connecticut adopted at their Session—last Spring—demanding in a tone somewhat peremptory the return of certain documents relating to the State of Connecticut, received at second or third hand from Governor Trumbull, but which the Resolutions assert are Archives of the State, and ought never to have been removed from the State-house at Hartford, but have come into possession of the Massachusetts Historical Society— The subject was referred to the President Savage, and two members to report thereon. The meeting adjourned soon after one. I returned and sat again to Mr Healy and Mr Dubourjal till past two. I then went and dined at Dr Frothingham’s with Mr Edward Everett, John G. Palfrey and Caleb Stetson— At 4. I took up Miss Smith at Mr Foster’s and we came out to Quincy. "

Another Letter, of a different character was from John Howland President of the Historical Society of Rhode-Island—returning the medal which at the request of Commodore Jesse D. Elliot I had forwarded to them—and with it two copies of a Resolution of the Society requesting me to return the medal to Commodore Elliot— The course for me to pursue in this case must be subject of cool reflection— I went to Boston this morning with Louisa C. Smith and Mrs Charles— Leaving Miss Smith at Mr James H. Foster’s, and Mrs Charles at Dr Frothingham’s I called at Dr. Bigelow’s house to consult him, but he was not at home— I then went and sat an hour from 11 to 12 to Mr Healy and Mr Dubourjal— They had hitherto painted me in a black silk Stock— But at the last sitting, Mr Healy requested me to come this day with a white cravat which I did— At noon I left them and went and attended the monthly meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society— There were but two members of the second Section of the Society present, and neither of whom had any communication to make— The only subject acted upon was a Resolution or Resolutions of the Legislature of the State of Connecticut adopted at their Session—last Spring—demanding in a tone somewhat peremptory the return of certain documents relating to the State of Connecticut, received at second or third hand from Governor Trumbull, but which the Resolutions assert are Archives of the State, and ought never to have been removed from the State-house at Hartford, but have come into possession of the Massachusetts Historical Society— The subject was referred to the President Savage, and two members to report thereon. The meeting adjourned soon after one. I returned and sat again to Mr Healy and Mr Dubourjal till past two. I then went and dined at Dr Frothingham’s with Mr Edward Everett, John G. Palfrey and Caleb Stetson— At 4. I took up Miss Smith at Mr Foster’s and we came out to Quincy. "

Nicholas Murray, Minister of the 1st. Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth-town, New-Jersey, urging again with great earnestness my attendance on Monday the 24th. of next November at the ceremony of erecting the monument in honour of the Revd. James Caldwell— Day after day crowds upon me the conviction that neither my bodily nor my mental powers will bear me out in making the attempt.— With Mr Murray’s Letter are enclosed one to me from W.

                "text": "26. IV:30. Friday.  My way of life must change. I still awake, somewhat irregularly between midnight and four in the morning, and to lie in bed long after waking is irksome— I rise before or soon after four. I have been obliged to cease taking the shower bath— I still wash and use the friction of the horse hair mittens and strap— I no longer dig in my garden or nursery, but still light my lamp and make my fire in my writing chamber.— Occasionally I walk up the hill and from the eastern corner of my Son’s house witness the rising of the Sun, but an unintermitting an universal tremor of my whole body, deprives me of the use of my hands for writing, and even for feeding myself— The last days of my life for any useful purpose are at hand, and the only rational hope left me as the possible result of prayer is that the mind may be spared, and not in total prostration precede the dissolution of the body— In this condition I this day executed with my wife renouncing her right of dower, a deed in fix, of about a half acre of land on the hill opposite to my residence in Quincy, to the Revd. William Parsons Lunt, the Minister of the Congregational church of which I am a member, for a house lot on which he proposes to build— Of this church all my ancestors of the name of Adams, from its first gathering at Mount Wollaston—the Patriarch Henry, the elder and the younger Joseph, my grandfather John and my father, John, have been in their successive days and generations, members, and it is the Christian church in the bosom of which I intend that my mortal remains shall be deposited. I have given to Mr Lunt this lot of Land the Deed of which was drawn, and is witnessed by my Son— I took it over to my neighbour Mr George W. Beale’s for him to take the acknowledgment of it as a Justice of the Peace, but he was absent from home on a visit to his son at Springfield— In my forlorn condition I still receive numerous Letters, visitors and invitations, as if I were yet a man capable of action in the world— I have a Letter from C. Edwards Lester, with a copy of a small duodecimo volume translated by him from the Italian, and published at New-York entitled the Citizen of a Republic—what are his rights, his duties and privileges and what should be his Education—by Ansaldo Ceba, a Genoese republican of the 16th. century. This book Mr Lester has been pleased to dedicate to me, which seems at least to impose upon me the obligation of reading it— Yet, I have neither time nor power so to do— I received also this morning a Letter from E. E. Putnam Secretary of the North Danvers Lyceum, inviting me to deliver a Lecture before them this Season— Every such invitation to me now is a pungent affliction— I omitted even to answer the pressing invitation of Marshall P. Wilder President of the horticultural Society to be present at their annual festival last Friday— Until the day came, I had hoped to attend, and when it came I had not the heart to go.— I have ever since been thinking of writing an apology to Mr Wilder but the time has passed and it is not written— "

Sunday  I attended divine service, morning and afternoon of this day Mr Lunt preached this morning, from Matthew 6.8. “for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him.” His afternoon text was again from Matthew 26.24. [“]The Son of man goeth as it is written of him, but wo unto that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed!” Mr Lunt omitted from the text the remainder of the verse.— [“]It had been good for that man, if he had not been born.”— The believers in the doctrine of universal salvation, an opinion which I have myself been greatly inclined to embrace are much embarrassed by this saying of Jesus Christ, but I remember to have heard the Revd. Peter Whitney, the predecessor of Mr. Lunt as the Pastor of this Church, urge with great earnestness in a Sermon, that Judas Iscariot himself would form the exception to the ultimate salvation of the whole human race— It is a question the interest of which to every individual is exclusively confined to himself. The Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory assumes that the prayers of the living may avail to redeem from punishment all but the deadly sins, and this also is a creed which I would adopt, if I could. There is something so revolting to every feeling of my heart in the belief that a God whose tender mercies are over all his works should ever have created a sentient being for a transient life on earth followed by endless misery in another world, that I cannot adopt it if I would— Retributive justice I can believe, and await with fear and trembling the judgment even of a merciful God—but I can form no conception of almighty power without an attribute of justice and no conception of Justice exercising power only to avenge, and to create only for misery— Mr Lunt gave notice that from this time forth for the winter Season, the bell for the morning Sunday service would be rung at half past ten, and for the afternoon service at a quarter before 2. He gave notice also that the communion would be administered the next Lord’s day, and that the usual annual collection would then be taken up— Mr Degrand came out from Boston and dined and spent the evening with us— And on returning from meeting this afternoon we found Mr Healy and Mr Dubourjal here— The latter had brought out his portrait in crayons of me, upon which at his request I wrote my name— Their visit was short as they were engaged to take tea, at Mrs Russell’s in Milton— My Son and his wife spent the Evening with us.

But I saw the Sun rise from the Eastern corner of my Son’s house, and precisely at the moment when his whole disk was visible above the horizon the Stone temple clock, struck six.— The inability to write will throw a load of superfluous time on my hands which I shall scarcely know how to employ. On Saturday while I was in Boston Mr. Samuel T. Armstrong came out to pay me a visit, and left a Letter informing me that for the benefit of his health he has taken passage, for himself and Mrs Armstrong in the Steamer Cambria to sail on the 16th. of October next, with the view to be absent a year or more, and to visit many parts of the Continent of Europe— And he intimates that introductory Letters from me would be very acceptable.  This day impotent as I am I answered the Letter of John Howland President of the Historical Society of Rhode Island with which he returned the medal struck by Commodore Jesse D. Elliot in honour of J. Fenimore Cooper, and which at Elliot’s request I had sent last March to Mr Howland for the historical Society of Rhode-Island— The Society have refused to receive the Medal, alledging that Mr Cooper’s work avows opinions injurious to the reputation of the late Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and resolved to return the medal to me with a request that I would return it to Commodore Elliot, and they directed that two copies of their resolution should be sent to me, with a request that I should forward one of them with the medal to Commodore Elliot. The Rhode Island historical Society had the right to refuse to receive the present of Commodore Elliots medal, and as I had forwarded it to them, they had the right to return the medal with their refusal to me— But they had no right to ask me to return the medal to Commodore Elliot or to transmit their resolution to him. In answering Mr Howland’s Letter therefore, I informed him that I declined the office requested of me by the historical Society of Rhode Island to return the medal to Commodore Elliot or to communicate to him the copy of their resolution refusing to receive it, with which they desire to charge me—but that I hold them to be delivered to any person authorized by them to receive them, retaining the copy of their resolution intended by them for myself— I took my Letter to the Post-Office and on my return homeward called at my Son’s house and saw his wife, who advised me to consult Dr Woodward on this paralytic affection which disables me from writing— My wife gave me the same advice. Dr Woodward was accordingly sent for and came— I stated my case to him— He prescribed for this night two blue pills on going to bed, and to morrow morning a dose of magnesia, with sulphat of potash.

Hackett dated Tremont House Boston 23d. instt. with his Manuscript Common-place book, containing humourous remarks upon Shakespear’s Plays and upon several of the principal performers of the part of Hamlet—his correspondence with me upon that subject is pasted in printed slips in this Volume, and his Letter requests a spare copy if I have one of my remarks heretofore published upon the Tragedy of Othello— His Common place book furnished us amusement for this evenings reading— "

Williams, and Daniel Weld, see my Journal of that date.— I promised them to prepare a preface, to this republication, if possible in the course of the then next Summer, which I have however not been able to perform— They have repeatedly renewed the application and Mr. Gassett has furnished me with all the books and papers necessary for the execution of the task— Meanwhile my disability has been increasing from day to day, and now I am indebted to my daughter Mrs. John Adams for writing even this record of my Diary— Last week while I was in Boston Messrs. Gassett, Odiorne, Williams & Weld, came out again to remind me of my promise to prepare this Preface—and I am reminded of it again by the letter and copy of the proposals received this morning from Mr. Gassett— I received also a Letter from Augustus Harris of Coldbrook, Coos County New Hampshire of the 20th. of October asking for Documents to prevent the Election of John Woodbury as a member of Congress from that State, because he is in favor of the Annexation of Texas— This comes a day too late— Also a letter from Thomas G. Whittemore, who married the daughter of my Cousin Susanna Adams asking for an Autograph of my Father—the letter is dated at Cambridge yesterday— He is the Post Master there— I answered the letter of Mr Gassett, and despatched it with a letter to Commodore Jesse D. Elliott informing him of the refusal of the Historical Society of Rhode Island to receive his Medal struck in honor of J. Finnemore Cooper and of the correspondence between John Howland President of that Society and me relating to this subject— This afternoon with my wife and daughter I rode round the Braintree Meeting House square, and we amused the evening with Mr. Hacketts Manuscript notes upon Shakespeare— "

John 5–12— He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life—and in the afternoon from Romans 13–10— Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law— Both admirable Sermons and both lucid expositions of the system of Christianity— And in the Discourse in the morning, commenting upon the words of his Text he said that Christianity was to be considered not so much for Law as a Life.— And expanded the assertion in the Text that to have the Son is Identical of Life into a general exposition of all the Virtues and Graces which constitute the Life of a pure disciple of Christ— In the afternoon Discourse the theme was essentially the same— If Love is the fulfilling of the Law it is the hinge upon which the whole system of Christianity revolves— Mr Lunts discourses are perhaps too exclusively confined to this Class of religious topics—there is some want of variety in his selection of the subjects on which he treats—a defect to which Clergymen obliged to produce two Sermons every week is always liable— I rode to, and from the Meeting Morning and Afternoon and for the remainder of the day was confined to the House— I answered the letter of Alexander Sheldon to send with the book which at his request I have purchased for him—and I answered the Letter of John Rankin and his enquiries respect the 5th. Article of the Definitive Treaty of Peace of 3d. September 1783— It is strange that a person claiming at this day indemnity from the State of Pennsylvania for the confiscation of Refugee property during the Revolutionary War, should be so utterly ignorant of the controversy and Negotiations between the United States and Great-Britain from the conclusion of that Treaty, to the execution of the Treaty of 19. November 1794— I began a Letter to Mr. Hackett, and with the aid of Miss Cutts read in the evening part of Richard Rush’s Volume, of his Negotiations in England from 1817. to 1825— A second work on that subject— "

I went in it to the United States Hotel, and saw the ladies after breakfasting take their seats in the railway Cars by the way of Long Island for New York. At the Depot I met Mr J. Wingate Thornton a friend and relative of Miss Cutts, who came to take leave of her. We saw them start at five minutes past six o’clock and Mr Thornton walked with me to the door of my sons house. He spoke to me of an ancient deed of Thomas Sheppard my ancestor, which he had sent me and which he wishes me to return. My Granddaughter Louisa Catharine writes my journal for me and her Mama wrote for me an answer to the letter of Mr John Sherwood, of Jamestown North Carolina Mr William Ellis of Dedham was here this morning and made many inquiries about the claim of Jesse Dunbar and his legal representatives for a pension. That claim has been pending between the house of representatives of the United States and the Commissioner of pensions Under the Secretary of War for several years. My recollection did not enable me to inform Mr Ellis of its present condition, but I must remember it immediately after my return to Washington. In my walk before dinner I stopped at the printing office of the Emancipator newspaper and returned to Mr Joshua Leavitt the parliamentary documents relating to the Slave trade in 1843 which I had borrowed of him last winter. At the bookstore of Little & Brown I stopped and took the volume, of W. T. Brande a Dictionary of Science Literature and Art which I have purchased with the bill for five dollars sent to me by Alexander Sheldon of Randolph Cataraugus County N.Y. and with which he requested me to purchase for him a book. It was sent home to me at my son’s house this evening. I took also the seventh volume second series of Jared Sparks’s Library of American biography, containing the lives of John Ribault, Sabastian Rale and William Palfrey— This evening I went with my son and his daughter Louisa to the Howard Athenæum, Heretofore called the Millerite tabernacle but now transformed into a theatre, Where we saw the “School for Scandal” with a foolish farce called “Chaos is come again.” The principal performer of this company is Mrs A. C. Mowatt, an American lady of New York, little turned of twenty but already celebrated as Authoress of a successful comedy called “Fashion,” recently performed sundry times at New York— Her performance of the part of Lady Teazle was respectable but not of the first style of Excellence. The part of Charles Surface was performed by a man named Crisp who with the other performers was about equal to the common average of a strolling company. It was past eleven before we got home. Ex-president Quincy, had called here in the course of the evening while we were out. "

The train to leave the Depot at South Boston at ten o’clock A.M., and to leave Plymouth to return at three o’clock P.M. I received also a printed circular signed by William J.

I answered this letter declining the invitation to attend the meeting on account of the state of my health, and wrote to Mr A. J. Downing, requesting his directions where to send the seedling trees which I have promised him, and they are now ready to be shipped. In my walk before dinner, I called upon Judge John Davis who told me he had received an invitation to go to Plymouth at the opening of the Old Colony railroad tomorrow morning, but thought his age and infirmities were such that he should not be able to go. I said I had the same apology to make but believed I should nevertheless go and urged him to do the same. After dinner I called to see Dr George Parkman, but he was not at home, neither was Dr Frothingham, but I found Mr & Mrs Edward Everett at their house and with them Mr & Mrs Alexander H. Everett, and soon after Mr Hale’s family of daughters came in, among whom I saw with great pleasure, Miss Sarah Hale, whom in July 1843.

Dr George Parkman, came out as I was passing by his house and walked with me. He left me at the door but Mr Cadmus’ shop was not yet open. I then took a solitary walk to the bottom of Long Wharf, a place from my earliest infancy well known to me and which as to a Pilgrimage I always feel an impulse to return whenever I come to Boston, for some days. Thence I returned to Cadmus’s shop, which was just opened and was shaved. After breakfast I took a hack and went to the depot of the Old Colony railroad and there entered the train of cars which started at precisely ten o’clock and at half past twelve landed us close to the Plymouth rock. The company consisted of hundreds of persons stockholders of the company and invited guests, in a train ofcars. Among them were my old friend Judge John Davis, his brother Isaac P., Mr Daniel Webster, Mr Josiah Quincy Jr, Mr P. P. F. de Grand and many others of my old acquaintance and friends, and still more numerous strangers. In the short time that I remained at Plymouth I called at the houses of Mr J. L. Hedge, and Mr William Davis. At one o’clock the company sat down to a dinner in the basement story of Pilgrim hall, as temperate, though not as scanty as the first dinner of the Pilgrims who alighted on the rock on the 22d: of December 1620 Yet at the close of the repast several toasts were given and my name was the first that received that honor. I returned the company thanks in a few words much embarrassed, but in which I took the opportunity of taking my last leave of the people of Plymouth as their representative in Congress during a succession of twelve years. Mr Webster was the next person toasted and addressed the company with his usual eloquence in return. Judge Davis, Mr Josiah Quincy Jr, Mr P. P. F. Degrand, and the conductors of the Boston press, were successively toasted and responded with cold water spirit. Mrs Thomas and Mr Daniel Greenleaf joined the train at Quincy and returned with it in the afternoon. The train left Plymouth at three o’clock and landed at the Depot in South Boston just before six and when it was quite dark. Mr Isaac P. Davis returned to his house in Milton Place with me, in the hack which I had engaged in the morning and I then returned to my son’s house in Mount Vernon St. "

The Rev Dr: George Putnam of Roxbury officiated this day, at the Rev Dr: Frothingham’s Church, in Chauncy Place, the text of his mornings discourse, was Mathew 25.8. “and the foolish said unto the wise, give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.” it was upon the Parable of the ten virgins, and the preacher, impressed very earnestly upon his hearers, the duty of having their lamps not only trimmed and burning, but with a large provision in reserve for the future. His afternoon discourse was from 2 Timothy 1.5 “when I call to remembrance the unfeigned Faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy Grandmother Lois and thy Mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee also.” The doctrine of the Commentary of this text, was the importance of Religious education, and it was pressed with great feeling, and energy. Mr Putnam is one of the most promising Divines, of the younger class, of this age and Country. The day was cold & stormy, with my Son & his wife, I spent the evening very pleasantly, at the house of her Father, Mr. Peter C. Brooks. We returned home about ten o’clock, Before we went out, Mr de Grand & Dr: George Parkman called to see us, & Dr: Bigelow was here while we were out. "

On retiring to bed last night, I found I had taken cold, by the excursion to Quincy, a hoarseness, a burning sore throat & no small fever, succeeded, which kept me awake, till past midnight, & I awoke before three with a light but sensible perspiration which partially relieved me. This morning, my Son took his daughter Louise Catherine with two other young ladies to Lenox for another term at Mrs Charles Sedgwick’s school. In my fornoon walk, I crossed the free bridge & went till I came to Dorchester St., South Boston which is swelling to be a City of itself. John Risk came into Boston & gave me a bill of Lading, of articles shipped on board the Schooner Duxbury, for Mrs Adams Washington. We had visits in the afternoon from Mr Peter C Brooks jr, & I received before dinner a note with a visiting card & afterwards a note from Mrs Maury, of Liverpool England, announcing herself, as the wife of one of the sons of the late James Maury, heretofore & for more than 40 years Consul of the United States at Liverpool, appointed by President Washington after the first organization of the Government under the constitution of the United States, he was finally removed from office by General Jackson, & returned to this Country, & died in his native state of Virginia— He left a family of several children one of whom is the husband of this lady, & still resides at Liverpool. She is an English woman & came over last June she says alone to visits her husband’s country & relatives, she appears to be a well bred & respectable lady, but there is some singularity, in the manner of her appearance here, nor does she appear to have any motive for her call upon me, except the relations of her husbands father with me, when I was Minister from the United States in England 30 years ago. I had received, a note from Oliver W. Holmes recording Secretary of the American Academy, of Arts & Sciences, with a printed notice that they will hold meetings on the 2d. Tuesday of every month to April next inclusive; at the houses of Fellows of the Academy at 7. o’clock P.M. At the place of each meeting will be made known, at that of the preceeding, month & by a written notice at the Academy’s room, & that the meeting on this evening would be at the house of Dr. J. C. Warren in Park St. At 7. o’clock, Ex-President Josiah Quincy came & we went together to this meeting, there were 27. members, of the Academy present, & Dr: Warren himself gave an extemporanious Lecture upon the Mastodon, an animal of enormous size, the skeleton of which has been recently dug up entire in New Jersey, & is now exhibited in this City. After the Lecture a plentiful Colation, with cold water to drink, served up in the next chamber, was partaken by the company, and Mr Quincy came with me to the door of my sons house. "

I took a warm foot bath last night, before going to bed, but my cold, sore throat & threatened cough, disturbed my rest; so that I awoke before 3 o’clock, but did not rise, till within a quarter of six. Mrs Charles went to Cambridge this morning, & I called, at the Shoe & Leather dealers Bank to exchange, a 1. hundred dollar bill, for gold, but they could not give me half Eagles, & I was obliged to take english Sovereigns, at 4 dols. 84. cts a piece, in their place. I am reading at intervals in the day the correspondence of Edmund Burke, between the year 1744, & the period of his decease, in 1797. recently published by Earl Fitz William & lieutenant General Sir Richard Bourke, K.C.B. Before dinner I had a visit from Mr A. H. Everett & before & after dinner from Mr Josiah Quincy, who invited me to a family party at his house, but I was engaged to the Wednesday Evening Club. I received an invitation to dinner next Monday from Mr R. C. Winthrop to meet Mr & Mrs Lyell, The Son of Coln William H. Freeman’s widow came & left with me, her memorial to Congress, respecting the decision of the Court martial upon the trial of her late husband, & the alteration of that decision by the late President John Tyler. When he first came the memorial was not signed, on his return he said his Mother had been informed that the Attorney General, had written to Mr Sloane, who had been tried by a Court Martial under circumstances, similar to the case of Coln. Freeman, that if he would apply to the proper office of the War department, he would receive the whole of the pay due to him, without deduction of any part, on account of the sentence of the Court Martial, without sending a Petition to Congress, but that Mrs Freeman supposed, that she might recover in the same way, the amount of pay due to her husband at the time of his death. I told him, that on reaching Washington I would ascertain the facts, and if I find that the pay can be obtained at the War department, I would inform Mrs Freeman, that it will not be necessary to present her Memorial to Congress & if otherwise I will present the memorial one of the first days of the Session. I advised also that another Copy of the Memorial, should be prepared & given to Mr Webster or Mr Davis the members of the Senate from the State of Massachusetts, to be presented to that body. My Son returned this evening from Lenox, where he left his daughter, Louisa Catherine. Towards eight o’clock Dr. Jacob Bigelow called on me, and after advising me & prescribing for my continued state of health went with me to the Wednesday Evening Club, held that Evening at the house of Dr George Hayward, about 15 members present, a social & pleasant party, as it used to be when I was a member of the same Club 55. years ago. Dr Bigelow returned with me as far as my sons house, it was past 11 o’clock when I took to my bed. "

Colton, Editor of the American Review, who solicited me to write an article upon the Oregon question, for the next number of his work, which from utter inability I declined. He then enquired if I knew of any person whom I could recommend to him, to apply to, for such an article. I named to him, first my Son, but told him that knew not whether he could or would undertake it, if he would he might be sure he would not get a better article from any one, if he would not I would advise him to apply to Mr. Charles Sumner, who had paid great attention to the subject and through whom I had received from Mr Faulkener, of Falconer, of London, copies, of his two pamphlets, on the subject— I also recommended to him, Mr George Hillard one of our ablest young men, as a writer & upon whom if he would engage for it, he might depend upon securing an excellent article. Mr Jonathan Amory, a son of my deceased Classmate of that name, now residing in Roxbury, came with his son for whom I have heretofore presented an application to the Secretary of War, to obtain a warrant of Cadet, at the Military Academy at West Point—and who is . . . to ascertain the prospect of success of his application. I told him, that in candor I could not give him much encouragement that for one vacancy of the Cadet for the 8th: Congressional district of Massachusetts I have already presented at the Department of War, 5 or 6, applications all with strong recommendations, & one or two of which were of earlier date than his was. I answered the letter of the Revd Hezekiah Packard of Brunswick Maine. At 7 o’clock this evening I went with my Son to the Odeon where he delivered a Lecture containing a Critical parallel, between three Tragedies, the Electra of Sophocles, Shakespears Hamlet, & the Semiramis of Voltaire. The house was well filled though not crowded, and attention of the audience to a discourse of an hour & 1/2, close & uninterrupted, on our return we found Mr Gorham Brooks, who very soon after took his leave.

I took tea liberally & imprudently at Dr. Frothingham’s where I had the pleasure of meeting, Mr Brooks, with his niece Miss Phillips. On my return home, I had a professional visit from Dr. Bigelow, who cheered & comforted me with good advice, & flattering hopes, concerning the state of my health. At nine o’clock I went with my daughter to an evening party at Mrs George Lee’s, daughter of Dr: Sawyer, of Newbury Port, who lives with her brother my old youthful friend William Sawyer. There I met a large company, all of a generation, succeeding my own, yet for the most part, of the elderly class. There was a handsome supper, & we came home soon after ten o’clock. "

I received this morning, a Letter from Mr John Eden, together with a large quarter Volume, being the book of Psalms, in blank verse with practical reflections by the Revd. John Eden, B.D. late vicar of St Nicholas & St Leonards Bristol (England.) with a brief Memoir published at London. 1841. Also a pamphlet, lecture on imagination & poetry with a special reference to the poetry of the bible by the Revd. Thomas Grinfield M.A. late of Trinity College Cambridge (England) Also printed at Bristol, 1841. The author of the version of the Psalms, was it seems the Uncle of my correspondent John Eden. I shall hardly have time to read it through, for it must be returned before I leave Boston, I should have been glad, if I had had the opportunity of comparing it, with my own version of the Psalms, in Rhyme. Mr Eden is a volunteer correspondent with me, but though a total stranger & an Englishman, has apparently many propensities, towards classical Literature, congenial with my own. I walked towards Commercial St. to enquire the time of departure of the Brig Ann Caroline, advertised to sail for Washington, & in which I wish to ship a trunk of Clothing books & papers. On my way I met Dr: George Parkman, who took me first into a Museum of strange things, belonging to a Boston Medical Society & then into the chamber of Mr Alexander to whom he introduced me, & where I saw several Portraits, painted by him. Proceeding then on our way, we met Mr R. G. Shaw, who insisted upon taking me to inspect the new Custom House, built entirely of Quincy Granite, even to the roof, & which I had already examined, about three years ago, when Levi Lincoln was Collector, an Office now held, by the late Governor Marcus Morton. Dr: Parkman offered to acertain for me the time when the Brig would sail, & came afterwards & informed me that it would not be sooner than next Wednesday. Mr Shaw informed me that a further appropriation of 50. thousand dols, will be required to finish the Custom House. On returning home I received a letter from a letter Christopher Hughes, dated at Galabrun’s, Washington, full of wise advise, about the management of my health, with an invitation to me, to visit him at Baltimore— I dined with my Son & a company of 15 persons, at Mr D. P. Parker’s of whom Mrs Parker her Son & daughter, formed a part. The dinner was appointed for 4 o clock, & we sat at table, till about 9. in the evening. Mr Edward Brooks, was here this afternoon, while we were out. "

Yet gleaming Grapes, shall be left in it, as the shaking of an Olive tree— Two or three berries, in the top of the uppermost bough, 4 or 5, in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, Saith the Lord God of Israel, this is the whole verse, but Mr. Frothingham took for his text only the words, two or three berries, in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five, in the outmost fruitful branches thereof. Words seemingly scarce sufficient to include the subject of a whole Sermon, but from which he formed a beautiful, & eloquent discourse upon the decay & diminution of human enjoyments, in the last stages of life, it is a peculiar talent of Mr Frothingham to make applications, thus comprehensible, & ingenius, from similar passages from Scripture remarkable either for singularity, then for their direct bearing upon the doctrine which he draws from them. The text of his afternoon discourse was Acts 9.6 and he trembling & astonished said Lord what wilt thou have me to do & the Lord said unto him, arise, & go into the City & it shall be told thee what thou must do. The subject is the Conversion of St. Paul but the preacher generalized as an enquiry suitable to be made by every Christian, & presented a general view of the answer in the life and conduct of the enquirer, to the question.

Morning visit from President Quincy, to whom I delivered all the papers, relating to the Observatory at Cambridge, which it was my business to prepare, but which I have not been able to get ready. I mean it was my business to prepare an address to the friends & supporters of this establishment with a view to a subscription, making provision, for the support of an observer who it is desired should be Mr Bond who now performs the duties of that Office & resides at the dwelling house connected with it but without other compensation. The failure of my health, has prevented me from executing this duty, & I thankfully accepted the offer of Mr Quincy to undertake it for me. Mr J. G. Palfrey also called to see me, but I was out. I called at the Tremont House & enquired for Mr. Hackett to return to him his manuscript with my answer to his letter received some weeks since, but he was no longer lodging there, nor do they know his return is to be expected. I received invitations to dine next Saturday from Mr. F. C. Gray & from Mr Edward Everett, the first of which I accepted, & declined the second, also an invitation from Coln. Swett to name a day of this or the next week to dine with him, for which I answered by naming next Friday. He invited us also, to call & see his pictures, which I did with my daughter, at one oclock this day. I am reading the Correspondence of Edmund Burke recently published, in 4 volumes, & in the 2d volume page 281. I find a letter from Dr John Curry, an Irish Roman Catholic dated the 6. August 1779 in which he informs him of a present a bill of three hundred guineas offered to him by a meeting of the Roman Catholics & at page 290. a letter from Mr Anthony Dermott, dated 9th. August of the same year, enclosing a bill for 300 guineas, in part of a sum of 500, in consequence of an unanimous resolution at a meeting of the Roman Catholics of which they pray his acceptance as a mark of their gratitude for the many eminent services he had rendered their body & he adds that as soon as in cash he shall have the pleasure to send him a Bill for the remaining 200 guineas. 291 is the answer of Mr Burke, declining to receive the present & he says “it is impossible for me with any agreement to my sense of propriety to accept any sort of compensation for services which I may endeavor to do upon a publick account. If the bill you allude to should come before you receive this I must return it by post, to the gentleman who transmits it” & in page 295, is the answer to Mr Dermott dated August 17. returning the bill as he had received it. I note especially this correspondence, to mark my approbation of the principle involved in this transaction. His services for which this offer of a private gratuity was made where performed in the discharge of his duties as a member of Parliament, the refusal to receive it was the act of a lofty, & independent spirit, the most creditable in him, as his circumstances in life were far from affluent. His friend Charles Fox was not so scrupulous, he permitted his friends, to pay his debts for him. His great rival & adversary William Pitt had the same offer made to him which he rejected. There may be some casuistical argument for and against the acceptance of large & costly presents under such circumstances, but for the preservation of a pure, disin terested character my opinion is, that they should always be refused in this however, I do not mean to include articles of trifling value, being unwilling to stake a great principle on a very small object. I dined with Robert C. Winthrop in company with 14 persons, among whom were Mr & Mrs Edward Everett, Dr: J. C. Warren & his wife, Sister to Mr Winthrop, & Mr & Mrs Lyell, Mr Lyell is an english Geologist who traveled in this Country, some three or four years ago, & then delivered, & is now delivering, Lectures on Geology, with great acceptance. Mr I. P. Davis, was also one of the party. The gentlemen & ladies, arose from table at the same time, a laudable practise growing into fashion in this City, but not yet unusual. I returned home soon after nine oclock "

This Periodical already so voluminus, & published monthly by the American Colonization Society has attracted so little of my attention, that I was not aware of its continued existence, till Mr Chickering gave me a few days since a copy of the number containing this article. It furnishes some valuable information of which I ought to avail myself hereafter. I walked to Commercial St No 44 & enquired at the Store of Hardy & Baker when the Brig, Ann Caroline, was to sail, for Alexandria & Washington, they said towards the close of this week, friday, or Saturday. After dinner my son went to Dedham to deliver a political address, & pass the night. Mrs Freeman brought & gave me this afternoon a memorial to Congress, stating her claim, on account of her late husband, composed & signed by herself, that which she had brought before, having been drawn up by a lawyer, she thought too cold. With the memorial she gave me printed copies of Coln Freeman’s Defence, before the Court-Martial, & of his memorial to Congress, prepared before his decease, & dated Boston Jan 20. 1844. which are to be added to her papers, & remembered by me at Washington. Towards sun set I took a walk round the Common, Mr Tower, brother of Zealous B. Tower, the Engineer & bright Cadet, of West Point, was here this evening, he is a teacher & Charles & Henry go to his school.

In this letter he states that the general Convention of the Presbyterian Congregational Churches in the territory of Wisconsin at their late session in Milwaukie appointed a Committee to report at their next annual meeting on the subject of Secret Societies, & he requests me to communicate to him & the public my views upon this subject; this request coincides, with the urgent invitation that I have received here for the republication of all my former published writings relating to Free Masonry, & increases my mortification, that I have not yet been able to fulfill the promise which I made to prepare a preface for that republication. Also a letter from Benjamin Raynor of New York City, complimentary to excess & requesting an autograph. Also a letter from John Meehan librarian of Congress, enclosing printed notices from O Rich & Sons agents for the purchase of Books for America in London & Paris, & informing me that Mr Rich had sent for me a copy of his recent re-publication of the voyage & discovery of P. Marquette et St: Joliet which Mr Meehan says he . . . to deliver to me at Washington. "

After a long & unusually quiet sleep on rising this morning at 1/2. 5. o clock in the dark, I got a severe bruise on the eye, by striking it, on the edge of the pane of the looking glass over the fire place. I received a note from Mr. J. Wingate Thornton enclosing the Copy of the deed of distribution of the Estate of my Ancestor Thomas Shepard once Pastor of the Church at Cambridge dated the 9th: of the 8th: month 1651. The original of which on parchment Mr. Thornton some weeks since lent to me & which I recently returned to him. I called upon Mr. Henry Gassett, & told him that I had not been able to procure copies of my letters upon the Anti Masonic controversy, without which the republication, desired by him & his friends, who had requested it, cannot be made, that I had a list made from one of my letter books of that period, of all the letters & extracts which I should wish to be included in the republication, & they were all marked in the book, & if he could procure a confidential person, in whom he could confide, to make no other use of the book who would make the copies, I would send the book to him. He told me he would copy them himself. I promised accordingly to send him the book & list. I told him that I had received this morning a letter from a Clergyman in the territory of Wisconsin stating, that a convention of the Presbyterian Congregational churches in that territory recently held had charged a Committee, with the duty of reporting at their next annual meeting upon secret societies & the writer of this letter requests me to communicate to him, my views upon this subject. I consider this as an indication, of an interest excited among the religious community in that distant region, in opposition to the masonic movements so extensively prevailing to recover the power & influence of Free Masonry, & that this had furnished to me, an additional reason, for desiring a republication for which I had promised, to furnish the papers, & the preface. I dined with Mr Edward Brooks, en famille his father was of the company. Evening at home journalizing. President Quincy called, & left with me the papers relating to the observitory at Cambridge, together with a statement to be signed by the members of the Committee of the board of overseers upon the Observitory.

I called immediately upon Dr: Woodward, who drew the lose tooth which has so long troubled me, & which he advised me to have drawn. I then went to the office of the Aurora news-paper, & gave Mr Charles Clapp its editor & copy of the printed prospectus of Blair & Reeves, for a publication of the Congressional Globe & appendix. I had received from them several copies of it, & with it, a circular printed letter from them addressed to the members of the house, to whom they transmitted the prospectus, desiring that the in the receivers town should be requested to republish the prospectus in their papers. I told Mr. Clapp, that this Congressional Globe, & appendix, contained the fullest, & most accurate reports of the debates in both houses of Congress, that were now published. The Register of debates, of Gales & Seaton, having ceased since the year 1837. I said them as fair & impartial, & have taken a complete set of them myself, which I suppose was the reason why they send these copies of their prospectus to me, but that with regard to their request for the republication of it in his news-paper, he would act his own pleasure. I requested him also, to forward his paper during the winter, addressed to me at Washington. I went to the printing office of the Quincy Patriot, to deliver the same directions to its editor John A. Greene, but his office was closed. I stopped at the Post Office & requested Mr French the Post master to forward all letters & papers which he should thenceforth, receive to me at Washington. I gave to Mrs Risk the prospectus of Blair & Reeves for the Congressional Globe & Appendix requesting her to give it to Mr John A Greene. We returned to Boston to dine. Mr Heely was here after dinner & I engaged to give him a sitting to retouch my Portrait at noon tomorrow. Spent the evening with my daughter at her brother Mr Gorham Brooks’s. "

In my morning walk I called at Mr James H. Fosters, & saw Mrs Foster & her daughters Elizabeth & Mary. Mrs Foster had been yesterday at Quincy, & had seen Mr & Mrs John Greenleaf, both comfortable, & Mrs Greenleaf not confined to her bed, she also saw Elizabeth C Adams & understood from her that she intended to lease the house at Quincy, & come to Boston for the winter next Saturday, & Louisa C. Smith proposed to come to Mr Foster’s a day or two before. Mr Sears called here, & went with me to Mr F. C.

The conversation on politics of former times, & literature. Junius, Lord Mansfield & Burke, some discussion between Mr. Hillard & me upon the character of Lord Mansfield, & the morality of Junius.

I wrote to the Committee of arrangements of the Pilgrim Society of Plymouth, declining their invitation to their dinner on the 22d: of Dec next, the anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims, as I must then necessarily be at Washington.

Peter 24. “For all flesh is as grass” & all the glory of man, as the flower, of grass, the grass withers, & the flower thereof falleth away 25. but the word of the Lord endureth forever, and this is the word, which by the Gospel is preached unto you. This was one of the most admirable discourses that I ever heard in the Pulpit. Its subject was the contrast between the transitory nature of every thing in the life & affairs of the human race & the permanency, of the Christian Gospel. The division of the subject was at once easy & natural, the transient nature of all that relates to the concerns of men, is a common Place treated by Dr Frothingham, as by others, but the permanency of Christianity he considered under four divisions, one, its history, 2. its spirit. 3. its doctrines, & 4. its effects. The composition was elaborate, & elegant, & after expatiating at once with brevity & with force, upon each of the four separate divisions it closed, with an emphatic & impressive repetition of the last clause of the text, “this is the word which by the Gospel is preached unto you[”] with a look, directed to his whole auditory, as eloquent as the words themselves. My son & daughter invited Mr Hughes to dine with us but he had a previous engagement to Mr H. G. Otis. In the afternoon, the preacher was Mr Robbins, & his text was from Joshua 24.15 “But as for me, & my house we will serve the Lord.” The subject was upon the duty of Parents, in the education of their children highly important & very well treated. He dwelt earnestly upon the part of the Mother, in the performance of this duty, & with exhortation equally earnest to the other parent, not to neglect the performance of his own, concluding with the somewhat singular expression, oh give us Christian houses. Mr Quincy, was here, after the morning service, & promised to call tomorrow morning in his carriage for our visit to the observitory at Cambridge. He said that Mr Sears, would go with us, but that Mr Abbott Lawrence could not, & he requested me to invite Mr Peter C. Brooks to go also. Mr Charles Sumner paid us also a visit. Mr Degrand took tea here. The latter part of the evening we spent at Mr Peter C. Brooks’s with several of the members of his family. I invited him to go with us, tomorrow, but he said he had another engagement to go to Cambridge, & would perhaps meet us, at the Observitory. "

We found Mr Bond there, lodged in a new comfortable dwelling house, & the whole building, with its appendages nearly finished. I had hoped it would before this time be completed but great Frauenhofer refractor will not be ready before next June, nor here earlier than August. The dome is made to revolve upon wheels, which may possibly occasion some difficulty hereafter, Mr Bonds opinion being, that it should have revolved upon balls. In all other respects, the construction & aspect of this edifice, appears to be admirably adapted to its purposes & gives the promise, of an establishment, for the cultivation of the Science of Astronomy, suitable to the honor of our Country & unsurpassed in any other quarter of the world. We returned to Boston, about 12 o clock, Mr James H. Hackett having returned to Boston, visited me, & took with him the manuscript of his remarks upon Shakespear, with my letter, & copies of my published comments, which I had prepared for him before his return, He told me that he was in treaty with some of the affluent friends of the Drama, for the building of a new Theater in Boston of which he is to be the manager, he said it was a mere project & he did not know whether it would ever come to anything but if it should it would bring him to a permanent residence in this, his native Country. Mr & Mrs Gorham Brooks, Mr Edward Brooks, Mr Charles Sumner & Mr Hughes . . . a dinner party here . . . till late in the evening. I received letters from post B Darwin Ames from Elizabethtown, Essex County, N.Y. requesting an Autograph. Also an anonymous letter signed “a real friend” from N.Y. stating after many fulsome compliments that he could not but call in question my piety & real faith, in one crucified Redeemer from the fact that he saw it announced in the N.Y. Sun, that my health was so good, that I was seen in a Theater, the other evening, with their notes of admonition. I have had such epistles from such anonymous Rascals before, men who deem it a heinous crime to be seen at a Theater, but quite moral to write insulting letters without daring to sign their names to them. Also a letter from B. H. Epperson at Nathan Hall, Princeton, N. Jersey I suppose a student at the College, asking me to give him some rules for the guidance of a young man just about entering upon the Theater of action. The patient must minister to himself. Also a printed Circular signed Robert Mitchell, Joseph R. Smith A. C.

                "text": "25. VI. Mr Jason Holbrook of Randolph came, with a printed Circular from John P. Duval dated Tallahassee Florida 6. Sept. 1845. address to the widow, or heirs, of Lieutenant Ichabod Holdbrook, Massachusetts Continental line, army of Revolution Weymouth, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, This circular informed the persons to whom it was addressed that he was in possession of some evidence, that Lieutenant Ichabod Holdbrook, was entitled to a pension, & grant of public lands for Military services, during the Revolutionary War, & Mr Duval offers himself as an agent to recover the claims, for 50 dols in advance, to meet expenses in prosecuting them at Washington & 20 pr ct in addition of the money, & land script recovered, & this upon a claim which he states to amount to 7.4.56, & 210 acres of bounty land. In manuscript under this circular is a note & signed stating that Lieutenant Holdbrook died, March 31st. 1823, aged 65. This circular proposed also, that the member of the persons addressed meaning the member of the Congressional district to which they belong would call upon him at Washington. he could inform them of the progress of their business & if their claim should be passed, could be present with him at the Treasury department & receive their money after deducting his pr ct, or they could attend in person. The circular adds, if you wish my services, direct to General John P Duval Attorney at Law, postage paid, as letters not paid are not taken from the office. I asked Mr Holdbrook if the Heirs proposed to accept the terms offerd by Mr Duval he said they did not, that they thought them extortionate. I said that Mr Duval made this business a part of his profession. I was not disposed to speak in censure of the terms of his estimate of the value of his services, but that I thought they were in this case, more, than they deserved. That if the Heirs were willing to charge me with this service I should consider it, as a part of my public duty as the representative of the Congressional District to which they belonged, & would do every thing in my power to obtain their claims without any charge upon them whatever & I believed that I could do as much for them, at the pension & bounty land offices at Washington, as Mr. Duval being very familiar with those Offices & with many such claims, which I had attained at both of them, for persons interested in them, that I would advise him, in the name of the Heir’s to answer Mr Duval’s Circular thanking him for his information, stating that they should prosecute themselves their Claims, & in the event of recovering them considering him, as entitled to a reasonable compensation for it. To this he assented. I then enquired who the Heirs of his father Ichabod Holdbrook were, he said there was beside him-self one living younger brother & two married sisters, & several children, of another brother deceased. I said that if they wished me to act in their behalf, they must all join in a letter to me, stating their claims & requesting any assistance to obtain them, they must also furnish me with authentick evidence to show their right, as Heirs of Lieutenant Holdbrook. I told him also, that letters of administration on the estate of his father would be necessary for the receipt of the money if obtained. He said there had been an administration, before these claims were known, but the administrator was dead. I said that new letters of administration, “de bonis non” the nature of which I explained to him must then be taken out, to authorise the receipt of the money & its distribution among the heirs, he asked if the administrator would be required to give bonds. I answered yes, whereupon he intimated a disposition, in the event of the recovery of the claims to retain the whole of the amount of them himself, on the ground of a dep. . . of his own upon his father’s estate at the time of his decease, admitting that he had never made this demand, upon the former administrator, of the estate. I told him it was too late to make it now & if any thing should be recovered of the present claims, he must share it equally with the other heirs, he finally left the circular with me, & promised to write me the letter requesting my assistance to obtain the claims & furnishing the evidence of the right of the heirs. I detained me till past 12 o clock, when I went to my sons office & executed with him, & Mr Nathaniel Curtis, a deed of a lot of Land in Charlestown belonging to the estate of Ward N. Boylston I then went into the Court House, where Mr Levi Woodbury was holding Circuit Court of the United States, & a Mr Giles was arguing before him a case in equity. After which I passed into another Hall where the Chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth Lemuel Shaw, was holding the Court, with an empannelled Jury, trying a cause, one of the parties to which was a bank. In these two Courts of the Judges, jury & lawyers in attendance no remnant remains of those with whom I once practiced, all was new, even the building in which these Courts are held. Returned home to dinner, at six o clock I went & took tea at the Ex President Quincy’s with him Mrs Quincy & their eldest daughter. Mr Quincy accompanied me home to the door & we spent the remainder of the evening with Dr: & Mrs Frothingham & Mr Degrand. The day was clear & to me severely cold, but to all others said, suitable for the season. "

I received a Letter from Joshua Drew of Duxbury dated the 22d. instt. requesting for a friend of his in Liverpool my signature to be deposited in the Mechanic Institute in that Town. My Daughter Mrs. Charles F. Adams wrote my Journal for me to the close of yesterday. I answered the Letter of James Rees of Utica and sent him a copy of my Oration on the Life and Character of Lafayette and informed him that I had no spare copy of the Lecture upon the War between Great Britain and China. There were two visitors this morning but I do not recollect their names nor upon what business they came. We dined at Mr. Goram Brooks where we met Mr. Peter C. Brooks and Mr. Hughes. We came home late in the evening. "

Thomas— Mrs. Adams was so much better that she was able to leave her bed but kept her chamber— I attended at Saint Johns Church morning and afternoon— The Revd. Mr. Smith Pyne performed both the services for the first Sunday in Advent and for Saint Andrews day— This morning text was from Isaiah 9. chap. and part of the sixth verse— “And His Name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor” It was a Discourse upon this prediction, of the Prophet Isaiah, seven hundred and fifty years before the birth of Christ of the Advent of the Messiah upon Earth—and the Discourse was an exposition of the peculiar application of the words “Wonderful and Counsellor” to the name, History, and attributes, of Jesus Christ the Saviour, and Redeemer of Mankind— The Sermon of the afternoon was from 1. Thessalonians 5.7—“For they that sleep sleep in the night, and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. 8— But let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of Faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation” This Discourse was short The Church was well filled in the morning but the afternoon Auditory was thin— I went first in the afternoon to the 2d. Presbyterean Church but found it closed and I presumed there was no Service there— I am told that the Revd. Mr Knox has left them and that the Church is now without a Pastor— In passing from it to Saint John’s Church I met Miss Mary E. E. Cutts who invited me to visit her Aunt Mrs. Madison with whom she now resides, which I accordingly did after Church— I met also Mr. Winthrop and Mr. Markoe of the Department of State— The day was dark and gloomy threatning snow or rain— Spent the evening at home without interruption of visitors— I had written a note this morning to Mr Hughes inviting him to dine with us this day, and every day while he should remain in this City, when otherwise disengaged— But he had left his Lodgings and returned to Baltimore much to my surprise as I had supposed he intended to remain some days in Washington— But it seems he came only to accompany me, to the end of my Journey— Of all the persons to whom it has been my good fortune to render important service in the course of my life, I believe Mr. Christopher Hughes to be the most sincerely and cordially grateful, and so little have I been accustomed to that return that I feel it a duty incumbent upon me to record in this Diary of my life though I can no longer write it with my own hand— "

                "text": "1. VI.30. Commencement of the 29th. Congress—  At 12. o’clock, Meridian I attended at the Hall of the House of Representatives— At the Commencement of the 1. Session of the 29. Congress precisely at that hour the House was called to order by the Clerk of the last House of Representatives. B. B. French— The Roll of Members was called over beginning with the State of Maine and proceeding Southward. 212. Members answered to their names they proceeded to vote for Speaker of the House viva voce— John W. Davis of Indiana received 120. votes— Samuel F. Vinton of Ohio—72. and 19. scattered— He was conducted to the Chair by Samuel F. Vinton and John I. McKay and was sworn, to support the Constitution of the United States, at the call of the Clerk B. B. French, by me. He then proceeded to administer to all the Members of the House present the same oath, beginning with the State of New-Hampshire Maine, but in the Election of Speaker I know not for what reason the Clerk began with the State of Massachusetts— After some irregular proceeding a Message was sent to the Senate informing them that a quorum of the House were assembled, had elected John W. Davis of Indiana their Speaker and were ready to proceed to business. A similar Message was received from the Senate and the usual Committee on the part of the House to join with a Committee of the Senate was raised to inform the President of the United States that a quorum of the two Houses was assembled ready to receive any communication from him which he should be pleased to make. The Speaker made a short address to the House declaring that he would discharge the duties of his office without knowing any Party and with impartiality a promise which will certainly not be performed— There was some question about the adoption of the Rules. McDowell of Ohio moved a resolution that the standing Rules and Orders of the last House of Representatives as they existed at the close of the last Session should be adopted as the Rules and Orders of proceeding of the House— Hamlin of Maine moved to except the 33d. rule commonly called the Hour Rule—restricting every Speaker to one hour upon any question in Debate— Payne of Alabama moved an exception for all Bills to raise Revenue—which after some discussion he withdrew— The question was finally taken by yeas and nays and the amendment was rejected 62 to 143. Chapman of Alabama moved to amend McDowell’s resolution by adopting the Rules existing at the Commencement instead of the close of the last Session that is to restore, the gag rule, of refusal to receive Petitions relating to Slavery— Chapman moved also the previous question but the Speaker told him that would cut off his own amendment upon which he withdrew the Motion for the Previous Question Tilden of Ohio and Washington Hunt of New York called for the yeas and nays upon Chapmans amendment which was rejected by a vote of 84. to 121. Holmes of Charleston South Carolina with a view to harmonize the House moved to Amend McDowell’s resolution by adding that a Committee be appointed to revise the Rules and report such alterations and amendments as might be deemed advisable— This also was rejected— Payne of Alabama offered again his amendment as a proviso—but finally withdrew it and McDowell’s resolution was adopted without yeas and nays— It was ordered that the daily hour to which the House should stand adjourned should be twelve noon— Cobb of Georgia moved a Resolution that the Clerk of the House should place in a box the name of each Member upon a separate piece of paper and draw in the presence of the House the names one at a time, and each Member when his name should be announced should choose his seat for the present Session— He complained of the present mode, of choosing seats, but Payne of Alabama immediately moved to adjourn which was carried by acclamation—at 20 minutes past two o’clock— I walked home— Mr. Frye called here after dinner and Mr. Archibald Cambpell jun spent part of the evening with us— Dr. Thomas, had been here in the morning Mrs. Adams is still confined to her chamber— I forgot to mention yesterday that Mr. Peter Hagner the 3d. Auditor of the Treasury paid me a morning visit— I have received here a number of Letters, Newspapers, and Petitions a special account of which I must give as soon as may be possible—with the help of my Grandaughter, I am enabled, as yet to keep up the current of my Journal and this day wrote to my Daughter Mrs. Charles F. Adams—at Boston to inform her of my safe arrival here— "

Mrs. Simpson, wife of Presley Simpson, came this morning and stated that her husband had been a Clerk, in one of the Public Offices, The Chief Clerk of which was Peter G. Washington—who had removed Mr Simpson last June—from motives of personal animosity, that Mr. Simpson had taken no part in politics, that she considered his case a very hard one, and had applied for the restoration of her husband, without success, though it was admitted, that he had faithfully performed the duties of his Office, and the only cause assigned, for his removal, was, that he had been many years in it— That Mr Simpson had opened a family Grocery store, on Penna. Avenue, and her purpose was to solicit our custom for any article of Grocery which we may need— Then Mr. John Davis one of the Senators from the State of Mass. called on me to confer with me, concerning any notice to be taken by the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States on the occasion of the decease of the late Judge, Joseph Story he intimated that there might be an expectation that I should preside at a Meeting, of the Bar for that purpose. I said that I believed, the usage in such cases was that the Attorney General should call a Meeting of the Bar, preside thereat and present to the Court the Resolutions adopted by the Bar, honorary to the memory of the deceased Judge— That I saw no propriety that I or any other person from the State of Mass—should take the lead or preside at this movement—that Mr. Story was a Judge not of the State of Mass but of the United States and it might be considered somewhat derogatory if any movement of respect towards him should be left to originate in persons from his own State. But if the Attorney General being a Va should decline to assume this Office I would readily attend a Meeting of the Bar and Preside if so elected by the Meeting— This would be some inconvenience to me as the state of my health has compelled me to decline attendance at similar Meetings for some months past— Mr Davis expressed his concurrence with my opinions that is movement should originate and proceed under the direction of the Attorney General and said he would further confer with him upon the subject— At the House the Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury upon the Finances was received laid on the Table and ordered to be printed, with 100 additional copies for the use of the Treasury Department— The Report of the Treasurer’s account was also received for the year ending 30th. of June last—and a Report from the Clerk of the House that he had received all the engraved plates. 150 in number from the Engravers under an order of the House of 25th. February last— The question between Garrett Davis and Baily of Virginia was then resumed after long speeches from each of them of Political crimination and recrimination Davis amendment was rejected by yeas and nays 80. to 115— Bailys motion, for an immediate election of a Printer was carried 129 to 62—and Ritchie and Heiss were elected viva voce. 123. to Jesse E. Dow. and Co. who had made proposals to print for 40 per cent less than the prices of the joint Resolution of Congress—of 1819—or twenty per cent less than the prices paid at the last Session of Congress received 69. votes— N. Lane was then elected by nomination and acclamation, Sergeant at Arms and Charles S Whitney of Illanois Doorkeeper— John M. Johnson was re-elected Postmaster to the House by 102— out of 199 votes— There were 71. votes for William J. McCormick—the former Postmaster—for whom I should have voted had there been any chance of his election as it was I voted for Johnson who performs the duties of the Office very well— Sykes of N.J. presented a Memorial of I. G. Farlee contesting the Seat of John Runck—returned as Member for the third Congressional District of New-Jersey— The Annual Report of the Clerk of the expenditure of the Contingent fund to first of Decr. 1845 was received and ordered to be printed— Adjourned at half past three o’clock— Snow— I rode to and from the Capitol— Evening visit from our neighbour Albion K Parris.

Decr. 1845—mentioning the death of his eldest Son, the severe and dangerous illness of other members of his family and other afflictions which have prevented him from visiting me during the late Recess of Congress— The whole tenor of the Letter is in the highest degree kind and friendly and while reminding me of the request heretofore of Lieutenant George Lincoln of the 8th. Regiment Infantry U.S. Army that I would send him the Pub. Doc. printed by Congress during the last Session which I had accordingly done, now repeats the request.— Lieut. Lincoln being on service in Texas—also a Letter from Jeptha. A. Wilkinson dated Williamsburgh Kings Co. Long Island N.Y. dated Decr. 1. 1845— referring to a Memorial to Congress in May 1840. concerning a new invention of his. Jeptha A Wilkinson being a Cylindrical Rotary Printing Press—complaining that he had found no patronage in this Country for the establishment of his invention and that unless he can receive some aid from the Government he will be obliged to carry his invention to Europe— 20,000. dolls, he says would be required to establish the machine so that the Printing of the Government might be executed at far less cost in time of money and with a superior excellence to what it ever has been done—also a Letter from John F Watson—dated Germantown Penna. 3. Decr. 1845—relating to the Revolutionary History of this Country and Biography of my father and of myself— At the House Bayly of Virginia was at his request excused from serving on the Committee yesterday raised on the subject of printing— The House agreed to adjourn over till Monday to allow the Speaker time to appoint the standing Committees— Cobb of Georgia had moved the day before yesterday the following Resolution [“]Resolved— That the Clerk of this House, immediately after the passage of this Resolution, place in a box, the name of each member of the House of Representatives upon a separate piece of paper; that he then proceed, in the presence of the House, to draw from said box, one at a time, the said pieces of paper, and as each is drawn he shall announce the name of the member upon it, who shall then choose his seat for the present Session”— This Resolution was this morning taken up— After some discussion Hungerford moved it be laid upon the Table—which was rejected by yeas and nays 88 to 115—and it was adopted by a vote of 117 to 77— A motion was made and rejected to reconsider it and the House proceeded immediately to carry it into execution— The members vacated the seats which they had occupied according to the method hitherto observed in the selection of them and the name of each member was drawn from the box by the Clerk and they successively chose such of the Seats as remained after those previously drawn had appropriated to themselves were left vacant— This operation consumed about three hours of time— It is remarkable as a revolution in the manner of appropriating seats of the members by a prescriptive unwritten rule observed from the first organization of the Government under the Constitution of the U.S. There were about 155 names drawn before mine but my seat one of the best in the House was left unoccupied and when my name was drawn I resumed it—almost all the other Chairs were filled by others than those who had first chosen them— Several notices of intention to introduce Bills were given and one of them by Robert Dale Owen of a Bill establishing a Smithsonian Institution. After some other Resolution among which one for Printing the Presidents Message in the German language were made and failed— The House adjourned past three o’clock— The ground was covered with snow—when the sky cleared off with a sharp frost— Evening visit from General Daniel Parker and Captain Casey— "

Morning visit from Judge William Cranch—my maternal cousin classmate at Harvard University and friend through life— He has been for fourty-four years a Judge and since the 21st. of Feb 1806. Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of the U.S. for the District of Columbia— And successive visits in the afternoon and evening from the Revd. J. Knox Minister of the 2d. Presbyterian Church—and from George Bancroft Esqr. Secretary of the Navy— I went to the Office of the Franklin Insurance Co. where I received a Dividend of 365.75—and exchanged my note of 29. Nov 1826. for 1800. Dolls endorsed by Phineas Bradley on 90 shares of the stock of the Company which was given up to me for my renewed note of this date for the same sum endorsed by William R. Bradley— Thence I went to the Bank of Washington and received 195. Dolls for two quarters of Interest, due 1. July and of October last on City Corporation stock—standing in my name— One-thousand dolls of which belongs to my daughter Mary Catharine Adams— I presented a Check for thirty dolls which was not paid for lack of Funds I then called at Mrs. Whitwells on the Capitol Hill and left cards for Mr. and Mrs. Grinnell and Mr. R. C. Winthrop—who were not at home—and from the foot of Capitol Hill I walked home— Meeting on my way Mr. Grinnell and Mr. John Davis the Senator from Mass whose lodgings are also at Mrs. Whitwells which I did not know and therefore did not leave a card for him and his Lady— With Mr. Bancroft I had a fine and long conversation on Politics and especially on the parts of the Message of the President of the U.S. relating to the controversy with Great Britain concerning the Territory of Oregon—he appeared anxious to know my opinion on that subject which I freely gave him— I said that I approved entirely of Mr. Polk’s repeated assertion of the principal first announced by President James Munroe in a Message to Congress, that the Continents of North and South America were no longer to be considered as scenes for then future European colonization— He said he had heard that this part of the Message of Mr Munroe had been inserted by him at my suggestion I told him that was true—that I had been authorized by him to assert the principal in a Letter of instruction to Mr. Rush then Minister in England and had written the paragraph in the very words inserted by Mr. Munroe in his Message— It was Mr. Munroe’s custom and had been I believe that of all the Presidents of the United States to prepare their Annual Messages and to receive from each of the Heads of Departments—paragraphs ready written relating to their respective Departments, and adopt them as written or with such modifications as the writer of the Message deemed advisable— That this principle thus inserted was disagreeable to all the principle European Sovereigns I well knew and that those of Great Britain, France and Russia had explicitly expressed their dissent from it notwithstanding which I adhered to it and was glad that Mr. Polk had so emphatically referred to and repeated it— I hoped he would adhere to it—but I must in candor say that with it I believed it indispensably necessary to make large expenditures for preparation by Sea and land to maintain it if necessary by force of arms that I had not been entirely without apprehension that Mr. Polk would ultimately recede from it— He asked me if Mr. Polk I disapproved of Mr. Polks repeating the offer of assuming the forty-ninth degree of Latitude as the boundary line between us and the British Possessions to the Pacific Ocean. I said that I did not disapprove it as the refusal of the British to accept it would strengthen our final adherence to our whole claim—but that I should not have repeated it myself at this time. Mr. Bancroft spoke of the Astronomical Observatory here—said he hoped Congress would make an appropriation for building a dwelling house in connection with it, and that he thought it would be necessary to attach to it an observer from Civil Life such as Mr. Bond— It was now under the charge of Lieut. Morey of the Navy— I said I was perfectly willing that an Observer from Civil Life should be attached to the Observatory here, but that I hoped he would not take Mr. Bond away from Cambridge— Mr. Bancroft’s manner and deportment to me was concillatory and apparently cordial— "

His first Parable in answer to this accusation was that of a Man losing one of an hundred sheep going after it into the Wilderness until he find it and rejoicing with his neighbours upon his Living found the Sheep that was lost— The second like the first is in form of an inquiry what woman having ten pieces of silver and losing one piece doth not dilligently seek till she find it and then rejoice with her friends and neighbours and in the application of these two parables; he says there is joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance— The third parable is that exquisite one of the Prodigal Son— The inference from these three Parables is a complete justification for Jesus Christ himself against the reproaches of the Scribes and Pharisees but it behooves the humble Christian not to mistake the real import of these instructions the charges of the Scribes and Pharisees against Jesus, for associating familiarly with Publicans and Sinners were not without foundation— The Publicans were odious to the people by the vocation which was to levy tribute and taxation for the Roman Government— The Sinners were persons of vicious and degraded character of such persons it was the duty of all honest, and virtuous men to beware and there is no principle more conformable to the Christian system of Morals than that “Evil communications corrupt good manners”— In justifying himself therefore from the charge of the Scribes and the Pharisees—Jesus Christ, does not deny the propriety of the charge itself but rests his vindication upon the motive which induced him to depart from the general principle of morals and the authority which he assumed of a Reformer He associates with the vicious and degraded incapable of being seduced by them but to redeem them from the consequences of their own crimes and to restore them to the Paths of honor and virtue— The example must be followed with great reserve by the frail and imperfect Christian believer—few have the right to assume the character of Reformers and every one who associates with persons of known vicious characters can indulge the hope of reforming them without incurring the imminent danger of being seduced by them to their own ruin— Mr Conner is a fluent respectable Orator not of a very high order of talent or genius— In the afternoon I attended at Saint Johns Church where Mr. Pyne read the evening service for the second Sunday in Advent and preached from Luke 4—part of 18. “He hath sent me to heal the broken hearted.” We had evening visits from Richard D. Cutts and his Sister Mary "

                "text": "9. VI.  Mr. John Gray according to the appointment yesterday made came this morning with a Mr. Mason who had introduced him to me during the last Session of Congress. His business relates to a claim upon which at the last Session a Bill was passed in the Senate of the United-States—entitled an Act for the relief of the legal representatives of James Bell deceased, and which did not pass the House— On the 3. March a Motion to discharge a Committee of the whole House from the consideration of this Bill was disagreed to but nothing further was done with it— There are sundry claimants to the benefit of this Bill and Mr. Grey has powers of Attorney from several of them as their Agent— The Bill is to be resumed in the Senate at the present Session—and Mr. Grey requests my assistance in behalf of this cliants and Principles, in whose behalf he acts— I requested him to exibit his Powers of Attorney which he said he would bring to-morrow morning. At the House, the motion of Lynn Boyd made yesterday to lay on the table, the Resolution offered by Mr. Schenck, concerning the election of Members of the House by general ticket in violation of the Districting Act was taken by yeas and nays and carried 112—to 72— Douglass of Ohio moved to go into Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union which was done and he offered ten Resolutions distributing the Presidents message to the several standing Committees which were adopted reported to the House and passed The 2. of the Resolutions referred all the matters, of Revenue and Finance to the Committee of Ways and Means— Stuart of Penn offered an Amendment, instructing the Committee of Ways and Means as the sense of the House that no alteration should be made in the Tariff of 1842— He sustained this motion by a long Tariff speech which was answered by Johnson of Tenn and all the hackneyed arguments for and against free trade and Tariff policy were repeated for the hundredth time, between these two debators— At the request of Broadhead and Joseph R. Ingersoll of Penn Stuart withdrew his motion of Amendment and all the Resolutions offered by Douglass were adopted without further opposition— The Speaker then called for Petitions, two or three of which of no interest were presented from Maine and New Hampshire and when Massachusetts was called no one of the Members from that State rose until the Speaker called for Rhode Island whereupon I rose and presented a Remonstrance of Citizens of the Town of Denmark in the County of Lewis in the State of New-York—against the admission of Texas into the Union as a slaveholding state— I had waited as has been my custom heretofore for the other members from the state of Massachusetts to present the Petitions with which they were charged before beginning with mine— When I rose Mr. Winthrop presented a private Petition but no other member from the state presented himself and I moved that the first Petition presented by me should be referred to a select Committee of one member from each state and asked for the yeas and nays Houston of Alabama moved the reference of the Petition to the standing Committee on the Territories which taking precedence of a motion to refer to a select Committee was carried without yeas and nays— I then proceeded to present twenty other Petitions all except two or three containing the same Remonstrance and were referred to the same Committee— I presented also two Remonstrances of Citizens of Philadelphia against the appointment of Chaplains by the two Houses of Congress which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary— Also the Memorial of Susan G. Freeman widow of Brevet Lieut Col. Wm. H. Freeman of the Marine Corps which was referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs and ordered to be printed— Houston of Alabama objected to the printing and moved to lay over the Memorial one day acending to the Rule to Debate the Question of printing— I desired the Memorial should be read which was done— Houston said he had no objection to the reference of the Memorial but requested me to withdraw the motion to print which I declined assigning my reasons for persisting in it and the printing of the Memorial was ordered by the House— A motion was then made to adjourn and was carried though I had not got through with more than half my Petitions and the House adjourned, after receiving several Executive communications among which was the Constitution of Texas from the President of U.S— "

Peyton, member elect from that state and brother of Bailie Peyton— He was a member of the last Congress but less distinguished in Debate than his brother who some years since during the Administration of Andrew Jackson was one of the Representatives from Tenn and in 1837. removed to New Orleans where he has since resided Mr. Brown passed a handsome eulogium upon his late Colleague Dr. Peyton and moved the usual Resolutions honorary to his memory concluding with a motion that the House do adjourn which they had already determined to do over to Monday next. My list of Petitions presented at preceeding sessions with those which I had presented yesterday was not yet made out at the Clerks Office, but was promised for me to be ready by next Monday morning— I walked home my fingers bitterly pinched by cold— Mr. Greenough whom I had met the evening before last at Mr. Pynes and with whom I had some conversation concerning his publications relating to the Oregon Territory sent me a Copy of the 2d. Edition revised, Corrected, and enlarged, of his History of Oregon and California and the other Territories on the North West Coast of North America Also a Newspaper containing his Refutation of a Statement in Mr. Caleb Cushing’s late Lecture upon Oregon and a Pamphlet containing the discussion between him and Mr. Thomas Falconer on the same subject— For the reading of all these Papers I do not find myself yet prepared to abandon the “Mystères De Paris of Eugene Sue.” This work is little more than a repition or sequel to the once celebrated Tableau De Paris of Mercier—one of the works among the premonitory symptoms of the French Revolution— The representation, of the condition of Human Society in that great City, of all the wretchedness and misery of all the different classes of Society forming the mass of its population is in almost all important essentials the same. The principle difference is that this work throws the subject into the form of a Novel Before the Tableau de Paris de Mercier. Restife de La Bretonne in his Paysan et Paysanne pervertie had exibited the portraiture of the vices, crimes, and distresses suffered by the Population of Paris in features not less energetic and horrible, than form the characteristic of these mystères— The originality of Eugene Sue is in the frame of his work Its alternate result is perhaps no more than a picture of civilized life under the existing institutions of civil society in all populous Cities The book is composed of a variety of adventures, incident to the high and the low, the rich and the poor converting into individual crimes, all the operations of the Laws, manners, and customs of Christian Nations— Dress tragedies catastrophes of which, are brought about among the highest classes of Society by the impulses of passion and in the lowest by those of hunger nakedness and want— "

Mr. Kavasales called here this morning I told him that I had endeavoured to see the Secretary of the Navy both at his house and at the Department without success— That I would renew the attempt and recommend him as I had promised to the kindness of Mr. Bancroft— I did not tell him the objections, mentioned to me, against him and his appointment as a Chaplain by the Chief Clerk, because it could only have mortified him. And the Secretary alone is responsible for them and to be reasoned with concerning them— Mr. Mason who had accompanied Mr. Gray when he came concerning the Bill for the relief of the legal representatives of James Bell came this morning alone. He enquired what I thought of Mr. Gray’s argument against the Legislative power to determine who the Legal Representatives of Bell were— I said I believed the argument to be correct but the question can not be discussed in the House until the Bill shall come in from the Senate— At the House, I found the Speaker, presenting to the House several Reports from the Executive Departments— The Resolutions of the Legislature of Conn—against the annexation of Texas presented by John A Rockwell a member from that State, last week were first taken up. He moved they should be referred to the whole House on the State of the Union and printed— Among A motion had been made that they should be laid upon the Table and objection made to their being printed— Mr. Rockwell in a sensible speech of about ten minutes insisted, chiefly upon their being printed, as a customary mark of respect to the state from which they had eminated. Lynn Boyd who had made the motion to lay them on the Table disclaimed all intention of objecting to their being printed and concluded by a Motion that they be laid upon the Table and printed— James B. Bowlin of Missouri moved to suspend the Rules to enable him to move for leave to introduce a Bill to provide for a Territorial Government in Oregon— The motion was rejected and a Call for Petitions commencing with Maine and passing in inverted order from the Territory of Wisconsin northward occupied the remainder of the day Robert C. Winthrop presented the Resolutions of the Legislature of Massachusetts of April last concerning the naturalization Laws— Lewis C. Levin of Pennsylvania moved their reference to a Select Committee, Richard Brodhead of the same state moved referrence to the Committee on the Judiciary Levin, said he proposed to Debate the Question and the Resolutions were passed over till tomorrow— I presented two sets of Resolution of the Legislature of Massachusetts one against the annexation of Texas and the other concerning Louisiana and South Carolina, they were read and I moved their referrence to a select Committee and that they be printed— Andrew Johnson of Tennesee sent to the Table a slip of printed paper to be read—it was read—and was an advertisement from a Boston Newspaper of the year 1741. advertising for the sale of a Negro and offering reward for runaway’s The Resolutions were laid on the Table by yeas and nays—83. to 67—and were ordered to be printed— The Resolutions concerning South Carolina and Louisianna were treated in the same manner laid on the Table 90. to 68. and ordered to be printed— On the motion of Stephen A Douglass of Illanois Chairman on the Committee on the Territories the Memorial from Oregon presented at the Commencement of the Session by Charles J. Ingersoll, was referred to that Committee— John Pettit of Indiana, presented a Memorial numerously signed Remonstrating against the payment of Chaplains to Congress from the public Treasury and moved its referrence to the Committee on the Judiciary but it was laid on the Table— The call for Petitions was not entirely gone through when about half past two—the House adjourned— "

Mr. Knox called on me this morning, and took leave of me on his departure for New York where he has received and accepted a call to be the Pastor of the tenth Presbyterean Church in that City.— He has been about two years Minister of the 2nd. Presbyterean Church here and like many of his predecessors is obliged to leave them from their inability to support a Minister in a comfortable state of existence— Mr. Knox made me a parting present of a book entitled Vital Christianity Essays and Discourses on the Religions of Man and the Religion of God by Alexander Vinet D.D. Professor of Theology in Lausanne Switzerland translated with an Introduction by Robert Turnbull Pastor of the Harvard Street Church Boston— A person whose name I think I never heard of before— It was ten minutes past twelve when I reached the Capitol this morning and the House of Representatives had already adjourned over to Saturday next There had been some difficulty in the House concerning the composition of the Committee of Claims— Joseph Vance of Ohio, had been first appointed Chairman of that Committee and had resigned— J. J McDowell of the same state had been appointed in his place and now declined serving on the Committee as being already appointed on two other Committees— He added that there were circumstances connected with the appointment of Committees of the House affecting his State which forbade him from serving on any Committee upon which his name was placed what those circumstances were he did not explain John R. J. Daniel of N.C. now Chairman of the same Committee stated that Stephens of Georgia had not attended the meetings of the Committee and as he was informed did not intend to attend them He moved therefore that Stephens should be excused from serving on that Committee and that a member be appointed in his place— It was objected that if Mr. Stephens was to be excused it must be at his own request and there the matter rested— From all this it appears that the Speaker has  given some disatisfaction by the composition of the Committees of the House— The assortment of my Petitions is not yet completed in the Clerks Office— After passing some time in it I went into the Library of Congress and took out the 3d. Volume of an English Translation of Eugene Sue Mystères de Paris the original Copy lent me by Mr. Hughes not being complete— In the Library I met Mr. Robert Dale Owen who enquired of me at what time I could make it convenient to attend a Meeting of the Select Committee on the Smithsonian bequest— This Committee was appointed last Friday on the Bill introduced by Mr. Owen and consists of seven members—Robert Dale Owen of Indiana, John Quincy Adams of Mass Timothy Jenkins of N.Y. George P Marsh of Vermont, A D. Sims of S.C. Jefferson Davis of Miss and David Wilmot of Pa—about as strange a Committee as could have been jumbled together— I told Mr. Owen that I would attend at any time and place desired by him— He proposed tomorrow at 10. o’clock to which I immediately acceeded but before naming the place of meeting he said, that upon reflection he thought it would be better to postpone the meeting till next week to which I also immediately agreed Morning visits from Mrs. Madison, Mr. and Mrs. Richard D. Cutts, Miss Cutts and Miss Anna Payne—whom I had met before in the Library— Mr. Cutts was married on the 16. this month to Miss Hackly at Norfolk Virginia— In the evening I divided my time in reading a Chapter of Greenhow— History of Oregon and California—and several Letters on the National Institute Smithsonian Legacy the fine Arts and other matters connected with the interests of the District of Columbia—by John Carrol Brent republished in Pamphlet from the National Intelligencer where they appeared in the first half of the year 1844— I have received a Copy of this Pamphlet from the Author— "

Christmas day—  25.— V–30—  After spending some-time of my principle present labor in assorting, filing, and preparing for presentation the numerous prevailing Petitions and Remonstrances against the admission of Texas as a State of this Union for the purpose of exercise and of returning sundry visits I walked forth and at the top of Pennsylvania Avenue met Mr. John Davis one of the Senators from Massachusetts to whose lodgings at the top of the Hill at Mrs. Whitwells whither I was bound— He told me that Mr. Grinnell and Mr. Winthrop with his Son were gone to N.Y. I then went to Judge Cranch’s House where I found his daughters Mrs. Rufus Dawes—and Mrs. Brooks—and Mr. Waterston as a visitor The Judge himself had not returned from the Unitarian Church where the Christmas Day was solemnized by religious Services— I met the Judge with Miss Appleton returning from the Church At Coleman’s National Hotel I called to see Mr. Webster but found that he also had gone to the North— Returning home I had a visit from Mr. James Buchanan Secretary of State. He told me that he had formerly visited my father at Quincy and said that in speaking to him of some of the Tories during our Revolutionary War were men of great respectability fine Talents and excellent private character but that they were all deporably loyal an epithet which Mr. Buchanan said had greatly diverted him— We had Company to a Family dinner Mr. and Mrs. Frye with their Son the Dr. and Miss Frye a daughter of Mr. Frye’s brother on a visit to him from the state of Maine and Mr. Theodore L Moody also from the state of Maine, sometime settled in Alabama and now a Clerk in the Land Office— They also spent the evening here and for the first time for many years I took a hand at a Rubber at Whist— I finished reading this morning the Book of Genesis and among the very striking Properties of this first Book of the Holy scriptures I have been more impressed than I had ever been before with what is called the blessing of Jacob upon his children the Patriarch’s of Israel in the 49th. Chapter It is said that when upon his death bed he called unto his Sons and said “Gather yourselves together—that I may tell you that which shall befal you in the last days[”] There is a Prophecy for each of the twelve Sons without notice of what he had before said that each of the two Sons of Joseph Ephraim and Manassa should form a separate Tribe. But of all these predictions there is not one excepting that of Joseph which can properly be called a blessing. The beginning of that of Ruben the eldest son is—“Unstable as water thou shalt not excel[”] and there is barely one of them but portends calamity and wickedness rather than blessing— This Prophecy is understood to be applicable not to the sons themselves but to their remote posterity the Tribes descending from them— The predictions are all obscure highly metaforical and not easily comparable with any fulfilment which afterwards happened to them— It is said for example Benjamin shall ravine as a Wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at Night he shall divide the Spoil— Now in the Book of Judges it is related that this Tribe of Benjamin was nearly exterminated in a Civil War with the other Tribes— In the 2nd. and third verses of the 21st. Chapter of that Book it is said “that the People came to the House of God and abode there till even before God and lifted up their voices and wept sore and said Oh Lord God of Israel why is this come to pass in Israel that there should be to day one Tribe lacking in Israel” This seems hardly a confirmation of the blessing of Benjamin by Jacob— The Tribe of Benjamin was indeed to some extent restored and the first King of Israel Saul was one of his descendants—but the fate of Saul himself and of all his posterity shows in glaring contrast to the prediction of the dying Jacob— The Tribe of Benjamin never recovered entirely from the War in which it had been so nearly extinguished— Of all the particulars of Jacob’s Prophecy that respecting Judah is the most remarkable— He calls him a “Lions whelp[”] and adds [“]from the prey my Son thou art gone up—he stooped down, he couched as a Lion and as an old Lion who shall rouse him up[”] and then the nex verse says [“]the sceptre shall not depart from Judah nor a Law giver from between his feet until Shiloe come and unto him shall the gathering of the People be” this is considered I believe by all the Christian Commentaters upon the scriptures as a Prophecy of the Advent of the Saviour Jesus Christ—and when I was a Student at Newburyport I heard a sermon by the Rector of the Episcopal Church at that place afterwards the first Episcopal Bishop in Massachusetts—delivered on Christmas Day on that text in which this position was maintained and which has dwelt upon my memory to this day— It was in the year 1787. or 1788. but it appears to me that the passage is not susceptible of that construction distinctly precluded by the tenor of the two following verses There is no sufficient explanation of the Grounds upon which the term Shiloe can be applied to Jesus Christ—nor is it apparent how it should be said that the Sceptre should not depart from Judah until he should come— The Tribe of Judah having been carried into captivity into Babylone hundreds of years before the Advent of Christ— "

VII—  I was again restored to the blessing of sleep which came on me very soon after I retired to bed last night and continued till nearly Sun Rise this morning but my sleep was restless and I arose suffering much with rheumatism— Mr. Kavasalas called upon me again this morning and I told him the result of my interposition with the Secretary of the Navy in his favour— That there were complaints against him not only of incompentency for the performance of the duties of his station but even with regard to his moral conduct and I said that if there was any just exception against him in that respect I had assured Mr. Bancroft that I should cease for ever all farther interference in his behalf—but Mr. Bancroft had said that no specific charge or formal report against him had been made and I urged that if any charge existed against him to his disadvantage in the mind of the Secretary it should be made by a responsible person in specific terms and that he should be allowed a hearing in defence and justification of himself— Mr. Kavasalas said he was very sure that no such charge could be made, but that most of the Officers were his Enemies and especially those addicted to habits of intemperance and to the use of profane language of which he was sorry to say there was far too great a proportion and he named to me several from Post Captains down to Surgeons and Midshipmen who were notoriously intemperate from who he had received the most injurious and insulting treatment— I do not repeat their names here but I fear that his charges against them are but too well founded— He added he had no doubt that these same Officers were the same persons who had made these informal and unwritten charges against him which had indisposed the mind of the Secretary of the Navy towards him— I advised him to call upon the Secretary at the Department and to repeat in his own name the claim which I had made for him, that any charges against him should be specifically made and that he should have the opportunity of self defence to repel them— He left me and returned this evening with a sad report of his visit to the Secretary, who received him together with another person a stranger to him and treated him as he said with so much rudeness and insolence that he remained not more than three minutes in his Office and withdrew from it in total disappointment, that Mr. Bancroft upon his entering the Office had accosted him with an air of anger and demanded what he would have—he answered that he was desirous of obtaining from him a private interview, that Mr. Bancroft had replied that he must speak out; what he wanted, or that he must commit it to writing. A short dialogue ensued in which Kavasalas intimated that as a Clergyman he had expected favourable if not indulgent treatment from the present Secretary of the Navy A remark perhaps not unnatural though not very politic for it exasperated Mr. Bancroft who thereupon told him that he saw himself his incompetency for a teacher in the Navy of the United States— After this unfortunate allusion it is apparent that I can do nothing further for this poor man and that he must submit with as much of christian resignation as he can to his fate— The Turks at Smyrna are not more inexorable to his Father and Mother, than a Christian Divine turned into a Secretary of the Navy will be to him— At twelve oclock I attended the Meeting of the House with the expectation of an immediate adjournment but a sparring debate of between two and three hours was sprung upon the motion to proceed to the election of a Superintendant of the Folding room an Officer not recognised by Law or even by the rules of the House, appointed hitherto as a Subordinate of the Doorkeeper by him, but which the House have now determined to appoint by their own election— There was a conflict of Patronage between some of the leading Members of the House at work to animate and prolong this Debate— A Grave question was discussed whether the Election should be made as now usual viva voce or by Tellers— A question which remained undecided in as much as after several motions for adjournment one finally succeeded by Yeas and Nays— While this debate was in progress a Bill came in from the Senate for extending the Laws of the United States over the State of Texas, an effort was made to pass it through the House per saltum, but it was finally referred to the Committee on the Judiciary— "
