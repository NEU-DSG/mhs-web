                "text": "1. V. Saturday.  On looking out of my window this morning, I found the ground as far as I could see again covered with snow. A light snow continued to fall till nearly noon, about 8 inches deep and without drifting, the atmosphere being calm— I called at the Department of State, and saw the chief Clerk Vail. The Secretary Forsyth was not there— I found a voluminous correspondence respecting the Pirates and murderers of the Plattsburg; with Saabye, and Forbes successively Consuls of the United States in Denmark; and between Forbes and Count Dohna then Prussian Minister in Denmark— I examined also my correspondence with Bagot, Antrobus and Canning, in several cases of the demand for the delivery up of persons charged with crimes— Among the rest the case of the man tried at Charleston S.C. taken in the Almeida— I was there nearly an hour and a half; and yet had not time to examine thoroughly the papers in any one of the cases; but I saw that many of them are very important for the discussion of the question of the delivery up of persons charged with crimes—Slaves—and deserters— The opinion of the Attorney General Wirt, against the delivery up in one case was referred to by me; but the opinion itself was not in the Letter Book, and I had not time to wait for a search for it among the files— The subject swells upon me as I look into it— I told Vail that I should move a call for the correspondence in the late cases of demands for surrender, but he was shy of giving me any information what they are— I went next to the Office of the Commissioner of Pensions J. L. Edwards, and found him at his desk— I left with him a Letter from Seth Sprague junr. and an affidavit respecting the pension claim of Lucy, widow of Melzar Stoddard— A Letter from Lewis and Pierce of Brooklyn L.I. to the Commissioner Edwards, with a Certificate of the deputy Comptroller of New-York in support of the pension claim of widow Dinah Benson—and a Letter from the same Lewis and Pierce, with a Certificate from the Comptroller in support of the pension claim of Sibbel, widow of Craig Kelly.— Thence I went to the War Office and reminded the Secretary Poinsett of my recommendation of Mr Samuel A. Turner of Scituate for an Appointment of one of the annual Visitors at the West-Point Academy—of his answer that it was too late for that year, the appointment having been already made—but that Mr Turner would be remembered for the appointment of this year— He took down Mr Turner’s name, and said he should be remembered. I spoke to him also of the Memorial from the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia praying an Appropriation for magnetic observations; and said I supposed its proper reference would be to the Military Committee— He said he thought a select Committee would be preferable. I met at the Department of State Felix Grundy—late Attorney General—now again Senator from Tennesee— Afternoon visit from Mr Dawson of Georgia and Mr Jenifer of Maryland. "

                "text": "1. IV:45 Sunday  I walked to the Capitol, and heard Mr Cookman, the chaplain of the Senate. An English Methodist; settled here within the last two years, and celebrated for his eloquence. His text was from 1. Timothy 4.16.— First clause of the verse “Take Heed unto Thyself” which words he pronounced with a loud voice—a deep emphasis upon each of the underscored-words and a semicolon pause between each of them and the next. He then began by some general remarks upon the characteristic of the present age—which he said was excitement—association—movement in masses—the power of numbers—which he exemplified by alluding to the multitudes of Meetings, of Conventions of Societies for Political, Religious or benevolent purposes— But he was now about to address his auditory individually, in a solitary capacity; and in the words of the Apostle Paul, to say to each man, woman and child who heard him Take—Heed—unto Thyself.— What an easy, natural, beautiful introduction! He made no formal division of his subject; but it divided itself; and he had the skeleton always in his head— First guarding against any imagination that his object was to inculcate selfishness, but only the spirit of that self-love, which is implied in the precept to love thy neighbour as thyself—he successively repeated Take heed what thou thinkest—what thou sayest—what thou doest with obvious considerations of the relative importance of thoughts, words and actions—upon each of which he descanted at considerable extent— Then still repeating the Instruction take heed to thyself, applied it to the several relations with others, he finished with words of exhortation, particularly addressed the younger part of his hearers— Hast thou ever done a good action? I hope thou hast—many—what thinkest thou of them now? do they not afford thee an inexhaustible source of pleasure? Hast thou never sinned? I know thou hast—what thinkest thou of that sin now?— I will tell thee what thou thinkest—with regret—with regret! if not with remorse—thy habitual thought is—I wish I had not committed that sin— Oh think then that on thyself depends whether thy destiny after this life shall be an eternity of blessedness or of woe.— Then after a somewhat over-charged and hyperbolical declamation upon eternal punishment; he closed with saying Oh! think of that dying admonition of a pious father—think of that angel voice of a beloved sister, urging thee to virtue—and Take—Heed unto Thyself!— He closed, and the tears were streaming down my cheeks— I left a card at the lodgings of the Speaker Mr Hunter—and one next door for Mr T. H. Sumpter. I saw Mr John Campbell, and at Mrs Corcoran’s Jos. L. Tillinghast and Governor Lincoln— Met R. Peters, in the street; who promised to send me C. P. Van Ness’s argument before the US. Supreme Court in the Holmes case.— T. B. J. Frye dined with us— After dinner at the Presbyterian Church I heard Mr Wood, from Genesis 32.10. “And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife, to slay his son.” The sacrifice of Abraham— The principle of obedience to the Will of God— I read the Article in the last December number of the Southern Literary Messenger, upon James Smithson— And part of the Instructions to the Antarctic expedition in the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, Septr. 1839— "

                "text": "1. V:30. Wednesday  Mr Lewis Johnson called on me this morning, and stated the present condition of the claim in behalf of the late William Otis’s estate upon the Government.— The final settlement is now before the President for his decision, which may be expected in two or three days. It makes allowance for the sale upon execution of the real Estate, but nothing for interest— The amount will be between ten and eleven thousand dollars, and pay all Otis’s debts leaving perhaps 2 or 4000 dollars for his heirs. Mr Lewis spoke in terms of high commendation of Mr Keys’s exertions and services in the case, both by influence and exertion. At the house, Mr Medill occupied three quarters of the morning hour in closing his speech on the New-Jersey election papers, which has become a mere question of trickery between the floating majority and minority of the Committee— Fillmore took the floor, not without a contest for the remaining quarter of an hour— Randolph attempted to correct one of Medill’s false statement of facts, but was not allowed to do it— Fillmore asked Campbell the Chairman of the Committee, whether the whole of a certain document had been read in Committee when they made their report? Campbell answered that as much of it had been read as had been called for— Fillmore repeated the question—had the whole of it been read? Campbell commenced a narrative of the proceedings in the Committee— Fillmore pressed his question again—was the whole document read—yea or nay? Campbell shuffled, without answering either yea or nay—when the orders of the day were called— Mr Bell resumed his Speech upon his bill, for securing the freedom of elections, and spoke about four hours, upon the abuses and corruptions of the present and last administrations—signalizing the organization of an electioneering system of Government, by the admission of the Postmaster General as a member of the Cabinet—by a sweeping system of removals from office upon political grounds—by the attempt to turn the Bank of the United States into an electioneering engine—and upon its failure, the destruction of that Bank, undertaken, and accomplished— He said he could prove if the House would give him a Committee that there was a great organized central association with the President of the United States at their head, and branching out to every State in the Union, and by whose command every officer not only in the Government of the United States, but in every separate State.— And he concluded with a story of a Vampire with which he compared Martin Van Buren;—but I did not hear this distinctly, and could not discern its point. Immediately after Bell closed, Watterson of Tennessee took the floor, and at the instigation of Weller moved an Adjournment which was carried and before 5 O’Clock— The members of the delegation from Massachusetts received this day six sets of Resolutions, adopted at their late Session, and we agreed to meet Friday Morning at 10. to confer upon what to do with them.

The Chevalier Friederichsthal, attached to the Austrian legation, is going on an excursion in the course of which he intends to visit Boston— I had yesterday written Letters of introduction for him to President Quincy and to Edward Everett which I had promised him, and also one to my Son, which I gave him this morning. In an hour’s conversation with me he told me that he had last Summer visited and traversed the Islands of St. Domingo, Jamaica and Cuba, with the purpose of observing attentively the relative condition of the population in the three different states of long continued freedom, of Slavery and of recent emancipation. It was apparent that the result of these observations was very unfavourable to African, for his great admiration was concentrated on the flourishing condition of Cuba, his anticipations quite unpromising to Jamaica—and his severest animadversions reserved for Saint Domingo. He promised to send me his comparative statistical tables for the three islands which he did this Evening— They fully confirmed my expectations.— His visit detained me so that I found the clerk reading the Journal of yesterday, when I entered the House— Briggs moved to go instanter into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the appropriation Bill; which was done after postponing at the motion of John W. Jones, the report of the select Committee upon the brawl between Bynum and Rice Garland till next Monday— Casey took the Chair of the Committee— Stanly had the floor upon an amendment which he proposed to offer to the appropriations for the public buildings after the rejection of the amendments proposed by Petrikin, which he considered as certain— I could stand this no longer— I rose and asked if Jones, Chairman of the ways and means seriously intended to persist in opposing Petrikin’s amendment—to stop the work upon the public buildings, and to leave the workmen partly unpaid for the wages they had already earned? Jones with some faltering at first avowed that he did; but afterwards worked round to a consent that the appropriation should be increased to 60000 dollars on the Treasury building, to pay the workmen their wages already earned. I gave him a volley for resisting any part of Petrikin’s amendment— He attempted to divert the attention of the Committee to my overheated manner—talked of the shin-plasters of my favourite institutions, and said he supposed I wanted an entering wedge to increase the appropriation for the custom house at Boston— I replied to him with an abated vehemence of manner— Govr Lincoln, Waddy Thompson and Hunt aided me with argument— Stanly consented to withdraw his amendment if Jones would accept the two amendments of Petrikin, which Jones however refused—but upon taking the question by tellers there was a large majority for Petrikin’s amendments— In the course of the Evening Ogle made his second Speech on the furnishing of the President’s House; and replied with extreme severity to some animadversions of Governor Lincoln upon his former Speech— Lincoln now made an instantaneous highly spirited and triumphant defence of himself, and turned the tables and the laugh upon Ogle to universal admiration. But it was a very unprofitable controversy to the whigs. The debate continued again till near Midnight— I walked home. "

Seaton was elected Mayor in the place of Peter Force, who has held the office four years.— I called this morning at the City Hall upon Mr Andrew Rothwell Treasurer of the Columbian College, to ask for payment of the years interest on their bond to me, this day payable. He said he had money; but was so much engaged in the city election that he could not attend to me this day; and I told him I would call again to-morrow.— At the House it was the day for offering regulations. But as soon as the Journal was read, C. Cushing rose to a priviledged Question, and before he could state what it was, Waddy Thompson, acting chairman of the Military Committee moved a suspension of the rules, to take up a Bill for raising 1600 men for the defence of Florida: and he sent to the Clerk’s table a very urgent Letter from the Secretary of War, and Advices from Florida of recent massacres by the Indians of our troops.— Downing, the delegate from the Territory, added his supplicating voice to that of Genl. Thompson; but the democracy would not hear a word of it— The motion to suspend the rules was lost 118 to 94— Thompson then moved the suspension of the rules for this day—lost. 116 to 85— Hunt moved a suspension for two hours—lost 111 to 98. Triplet moved a suspension of the rules to introduce his supplementary pre-emption bill. lost—72 to 121. Cushing finally moved his privileged question which was the reconsideration of the vote of Saturday, accepting Hillen’s report from the Committee of Commerce, which a majority of that Committee had reconsidered, and reversed— Cushing’s reason for moving the re-consideration was that he had found by the yeas and nays that it was a party vote— Clifford moved the previous question Grinnell, a call of the House— Proffit to lay the whole subject on the table—on each of which questions the yeas and nays were taken. The call of the house was refused—the motion to lay on the table rejected—the previous question carried; and the reconsideration refused 84 to 108. And now came the recess— I rode home, dined and returned to the house— At 5 minutes past 4 there were more than 200 members present and debating Atherton’s motion, now offered by Albert Smith— After a confused and riotous sitting this Resolution was carried and the reconsideration of it rejected— During the whole day, I was a silent, passive, humiliated, indignant, helpless, Spectator of the Scene.— I came home after voting for the last motion of reconsideration and while they were taking the yeas and nays— We had a small Evening party. Thomas B. Frothingham came in, just from Boston— High Summer heat. "

IV:45— Wednesday  There was a corner of a thunder shower here last Evening, and this morning the thermometers were down as low as 74 and the feeling, cold— At the house Linn Banks moved a Resolution for the adjournment of Congress on the 20th. of this month. days before and after were proposed, and Petrikin who chuses to have every thing in his own way moved the 15th. and the previous question, both of which he carried—the previous question by 113 to 22. and the day, the 15th. by 105 to 95.— This was no sooner announced than Watterson moved a reconsideration—carried 108 to 84. Question again taken on the 15th. rejected 88 to 113. Then the question upon the 21st. was carried without a division— This is a pattern specimen of the consideration and reconsideration of this previous question house— I asked the general consent of the house to present a report from the select Committee on the Memorial from the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia— Cooper of Georgia objected and my Report was not received. But Cooper came afterwards to my seat, and when I explained to him my reason for asking that the report might be received and printed, he said he would not persist in his objection.— The Report from the Secretary of the Treasury of the Commerce and Navigation of the year was received and after some altercation 10,000 extra copies were ordered to be printed.— The Bill from the Senate for continuing the Charters of the District Banks—all of which expire on the 4th. of this month—was taken upon by general consent out of its time— Petrikin and Mark A Cooper immediately started budgets of burdensome conditions, as amendments, which were sharply debated till the recess— I made a short speech to urge the indispensable necessity of passing the bill in some form before next Saturday. During the recess I went into the Senate where they were debating with much earnestness, the 9th. Section of my revenue bill. Before the recesshad moved to lay the Senate’s Bank Bill on the table, which had been rejected by yeas and naystoafter the recess Cooper’s batch of Amendments in superfetation of Petrikin’s batch was taken up, and divided into parcels, upon each of which yeas and nays were taken—some adopted, some rejected; until about Sunset, when at the motion of Petrikin, the house adjourned.— I came home immediately, and after a very light dinner and went to Mr Alexander Vattemare’s exhibition of Ventriloquism— My wife and granddaughter Mary-Louisa were also there— The sport began with sundry songs and duets by Mr and Miss Manvers, with accompaniment of the Piano—and the recitation of Collins’s Ode on the passions, by Mrs Manvers, very well— Alexandre’s drama is called the adventures of a Ventriloquist or the rogueries of Nicholas, in which he sustained seven parts, old and young, male and female, and imitated the planing of a table, the frying of eggs in a pan, and sundry other strange noises— The House was crowded—and well pleased. I sat between Mrs Paulding, and Mrs B. O. Tayloe— Home between 10 and 11.— Weary. "

We had fixed on to-morrow as the day of our departure upon our return to Quincy, but my wife was so unwell in the former part of this day that it was doubtful whether we should not be under the necessity of postponing our movement, one or more days— Towards evening however she so far recovered her strength and Spirits that she concluded to proceed in the morning— We were all intently occupied and none more so than Mrs. Adams, in packing up, settling accounts and bills, and getting ready to go at six O’Clock to-morrow. Mary has concluded to go, and take her daughter Mary-Louisa, with us. As the order of the Treasurer of the United States in favour of myself as Attorney to Ebenezer Lobdell, promised me by the Secretary of the Treasury, to be forthcoming yesterday was not yet in hand, I called this day noon at his Office and received it from him— It was drawn on the Collector of the Customs at Boston, instead of the new Receiver General Isaac Hill, as I had requested and he had promised— He now said that Mr Hill had not yet quite completed his arrangements for entering upon the execution of his office— I asked him what was the present condition of the Smithsonian funds invested in bonds of the State of Arkansaw.— He said the interest upon the bonds had been hitherto punctually paid, and he was just now receiving proposals for a new investment of the interest of the last half year—and he read to me several Letters containing these proposals.— They were of the States of New-York and others at 5. per Cent a year, and at about 90 per Cent, and of Kentucky and Arkansaw at 6 per Cent interest—the Kentucky bonds at 90 per Cent, and those of Arkansaw at 70. He said he should take the lowest bid. I expressed my strong disapprobation of the Sale by the Secretary of the Navy of Stocks of the States, at a much lower price than he had purchased them at— He said there had never been any sale of the Stocks of the States by the Department of the Treasury.— Besides the struggle to redeem the arrears of my Diary which accrued unavoidably in the last fortnight of the Session, I answered and declined the invitation of Mr A. J. Downing to visit his Botanical Garden, and Nursery at Newburgh opposite Mr de Wint’s— My wife visited this evening her brother Mr Thomas B. Johnson, who has been very sick, but is convalescent. Mrs W. S. Smith left us this day, and removed to Mr Frye’s. My neighbour Mr Parris, and Mr Cutts and his daughter visited us this Evening; and Mr John Bell of Tennessee, with whom I had a long conversation, upon the prospects of the Presidential Election— We agreed that the present appearances were favourable, though by no means certain for a change; but I asked Mr Bell, what were the expectations beyond the change, and found him quite unprepared to answer— He knew not who would compose the Cabinet of Genl. Harrison, and was not disposed to bestow much confidence in advance upon whoever it might be— I told him that at all Events he must be the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and he confessed that it would be the summit of his ambition— I was up packing till near midnight— Dismissed Thomas with a warm recommendation— "

                "text": "1. II:30 Saturday  Stonington— Providence. Boston— Quincy.  Heavy rain in the Night—but little wind, and a smooth Sea so that I slept nearly four hours, a rare fortune for me, in a Steamer— We landed at Stonington in the midst of the rain, a few minutes before 3.— There were upwards of 300 passengers, and of course a scramble for the seats in the Cars.— There is one which they call the Ladies Car, and when my Ladies had gone into it the conductor stoppd me and told me it was reserved for the Ladies— I said I was with Ladies; upon which he said the Car was already full.— With much difficulty I found a place in the foremost Car, and he turned Jerry in the Deck Car—that is a Car next to the Engine, and exclusively for the Deck or half price passengers— These are regulations not used in the Southern boats, and were new to me here— The scramble for places is a vexatious and unnecessary annoyance which would be removed by numbering the seats and furnishing the passengers with tickets correspondingly numbered— The rain continued and the cars flew till we reached the river, at Providence and snatched a cup of Coffee and a cracker while crossing the river in the Steamer. Then took seats again in the line of Cars, and at half past eight O’Clock landed at the railway depot in Boston— There we found a Hack-Stage belonging to the American House which we engaged and in which we were taken out to our residence at Quincy— Here we landed once more at half past nine in the morning—fifty two hours from our house in F. Street Washington and 16 1/2 hours from the wharf at New-York— My first movement is of grateful acknowledgment to a benign Providence which has preserved and protected us all safe and unhurt through the perils of a long journey though performed in a very short time, and to the melancholy catastrophe of one of which I was an afflicted eye-witness. And to the blessing of our own safe arrival is added that of finding all our family here in good health and comfortable tranquility— My Sons two elder sons John Quincy and Charles Francis were at our house when we alighted— He came over immediately after and then his wife with her daughter Louisa Catherine all with cordial greeting— The pangs inexpressible in words of the deep affliction in which we left this place last November, were too acute for the fortitude of a mother’s heart—my own feelings could be and were suppressed. John Kirke and his wife were here expecting us, and prepared to receive us— The rain continued with intervals through the day, and confined me almost entirely to the House I did however visit my garden and Nursery, which I found in no satisfactory condition; but I have lost almost all my interest in them— I unpacked my trunks, and began to write as I could, a Letter to Ebenezer Lobdell, and this Diary from the day before we left Washington.— This occupied the day; and I spent the Evening with my Son and his wife at their House; where I saw their youngest son Henry Brooks— All their children are thriving.— The Revd Joseph Angier, of Milton was a fellow passenger with us from New-York and gave me a pamphlet containing two Sermons, preached at Mobile, Alabama, on the 10th. and 17th of May last, by George F. Simmons—which I read this morning in the Cars— "

                "text": "2. V. Sunday  Communion day at Meeting— Mr Lunt preached his morning Sermon, from Acts 17.21. “For all the Athenians and Strangers which were there, spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing”— It is the doom of the Christian church to be always distracted with controversy; and where religion is most in honour, there the perversity of the human heart breeds the sharpest conflicts of the brain— The Sentiment of Religion is at this time perhaps more potent and prevailing in New-England, than many other portion of the Christian world— For many years since the establishment of the theological school at Andover the Calvinists and Unitarians have been battling with each other upon the atonement, the divinity of Jesus Christ and the Trinity— This has now very much subsided—but other wandering of minds takes the place of that, and equally lets the wolf into the fold. A crack-brained young man named Ralph Waldo Emerson, son of my once loved friend, William Emerson, and a Classmate of my lamented son George, after failing in the every day avocations of a Unitarian preacher and school-master, and starts a new doctrine of transcendentalism, declares all the old revelations superannuated and worn out, and announces the approach of new Revelations and prophesies— Garrison and the Non-resistant abolitionists, Brownson and the Marat Democrats, Phrenology and Animal Magnetism all come in furnishing each some plausible rascality as an ingredient for the bubbling cauldron of religion and politics— Pearce Cranch ex-ephibis preached here last week, and gave out quite a stream of this transcendentalism, most unexpectedly— Mr Lunt’s discourse this morning was intended to counteract the effect of these wild and visionary phantasies, and he spoke with just severity of the application of this Spirit of hurly burly innovation to the most important and solemn duties of the Christian faith— He treated the subject but in part; and promised to discourse further upon it hereafter— Mr Lunt’s opinions favour a compromise between the past and the future; disapproving alike the obstinate and bigoted adherence to establishments and dogmas, merely because they are old; and the restless and reckless pursuit of mere innovation— Mr Peter Whitney was not in the pulpit and Mr Lunt administered the Communion alone. After dinner, Mr Lunt’s Sermon was from Matthew 28.19. “Go ye, therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” This is also a deeply controversial text, and Mr Lunt admitted that it was one of those upon which the doctrine of the Trinity was built, and is advocated— But he thought that Doctrine so incompatible with the first principle of the unity of the supreme Creator of the universe, that it was not worth discussing, and that the Holy Ghost was but the emanation of the Spirit of God, pervading all time and all space but giving no countenance whatever to the Creed of a divine Trinity. I read part of a Sermon of Barrow, upon rash judgments— Coll. Josiah Quincy junr. paid us an Evening visit. "

The Midshipman has recently returned from a two years cruise in the Sloop of War John Adams Captain Wyman, in a Squadron under Commodore Read Captain of the Frigate Macedonian. They have been in the Chinese, Indian and South Seas and visited Brazil, Chili and Peru, the Islands of the South Sea, Canton, Macao, and Manilla— Foster is residing with his mother, who is passing the Summer with her Sister, my brother Thomas’s widow— After dinner two young men from Boston James Thomas Fields and E. Hobart came as a Committee from the Mercantile Library Association, to invite me to deliver an address before them at their anniversary meeting some time in the course of the next Month— Without positively declining, I prepared them to receive my excuses hereafter— My Son went to Boston, but returned home to dine and spent the Evening with us— How great a change in my way of life, from the perpetual action of fourteen hours a day at the Capitol in Washington, to the repose and meditation of this place, with no defined call to business of any kind— Yet my time is wholly absorbed here as well as there. And here as there the only labour of my life is writing— I have not yet retrieved the arrears of my Diary towards and at the conclusion of the Session of Congress; but as always happens, when I have any choice of my own occupation my attention is scattered upon a variety of subjects instead of being concentrated upon one— I would now prescribe for myself the following order of employment for the four months of interval till the next Session of Congress. 1. The Diary—two hours each day 2. Reading the Newspapers two hours. 3. Hearing my Granddaughter Mary-Louisa, read one Chapter in the French Bible of Silvestre de Saci— She began this morning, by reading the first chapter of the Book of Joshua—and I read in the English Bible after her—verse by verse. Breakfast half an hour. Dinner an hour and a half, including a visit to my garden, Nursery, Seminary and Orchard, writing one Letter two hours.— Wastage three hours— Miscellaneous reading two hours, exercise two hours— Writing out Speeches, Lectures, addresses, discourses, two hours—and lastly—Biography of my father— What time is there left for this; the most important of all— I have already looked into Buffon’s natural history of Man; Butler’s Hudibras—Plautus’s Mercator, and Charles brought me out this Evening from Boston, Brownson’s Boston Quarterly Reviewing for July 1840—containing an Article upon Transcendentalism, and one upon the laboring classes— Brownson is a broken Parson, who after losing his Capital of Atheism and Hypocrisy in the pulpit, has transferred the rags and tatters of his religion to the field of politics, and swindles for Van Buren, under the mask of democracy.

Tuesday  Weather still unsettled— Heavy showers of rain this morning and occasional light ones in the course of the day— Morning visit from Mr. Peter Whitney, who was unwell, and not able to attend at Meeting on Sunday— Afternoon visits from Mr Cranch, and Mr Lunt who returned the two Volumes of Winthrop’s Journal, and the old Manuscript Volume of the Braintree town records, which he had borrowed last Summer.— I despatched a Letter to Mr Anthony Collamore of Pembroke, enclosing a pension certificate for Lydia Stetson, and received one from Thomas P. Beal of Kingston, respecting the act for the relief of Ebenezer Lobdell.— I had forwarded the Treasurer’s draft in favour of Mr Lobdell to him yesterday; and this day began a reply to Mr Beal whose Letter burns with politicks— I have yet but partially visited my seedling trees, but enough to find, as I never fail to do; upon returning to them an abundance of disappointments, and here and there encouragement to hope and gratified expectation— No new seedlings of the last Autumns sowing. The cruel distress in which we passed the last six weeks, before our departure; the agonies of our separation from that adored child, the pang of which will go with me to my dying day, the anguish of her long protracted sufferings, and that frightful creeping upon her of Death, from hour to hour for weeks and months in succession disqualified me for all energetic action and extinguished almost all the interest I had so long taken in the cultivation of trees. There were two small plats in the seminary which I had specially given to her and in which she took delight— There were various seedlings upon them— One of them is now entirely overgrown with weeds, except one peach of the second year of stunted growth— On the other a black currant yet stands and bears its first berries, with an unthirsty apple seedling at its side— A self planted violet covered it with blossoms through the whole of last Summer, and there is a remnant of them there now. Oh! if I could describe the Sensations, which I feel on looking upon those two plats, it would be conceived how all the pleasure has vanished with which I was wont to look at the plats which I had given to each of my other grandchildren, as tokens to them of kind remembrance of me, when I shall sleep with their and my fathers. I have thought it would be to them a pleasing though perhaps a melancholy recollection— I did not think of the withered violet—the flower cut off in it bloom— Was not this trial fixed upon me as a warning? I spent part of the Evening in Charles’s porch; with him and Mr Lunt— Mrs Charles in the meantime came down here, and Charles came to return with her at the close of the Evening— In the intervals between my spells of writing, I attempted to read the atheist priest Brownson’s Article upon Transcendentalism which is as dull as it is impudent, hypocritical and provoking.— If his account of Cousins philosophy is correct, Cousin himself is no better.

Wednesday—  I had from the age of sixteen when the beard first presented itself on my face, with a few exceptions in early years, always made the practice of shaving myself.— The Paralytic affection which in 1813 Dr. Galloway at St. Petersburg, told me, I must expect would grow upon me with age, had so far disabled my right arm, that on the 18th. of December I was obliged to send for a barber and he shaved me every third day, till last Thursday morning when we left Washington— On arriving here I found that a young man named William Shaw had been settled here about 3 months and he shaves me— Deacon Spear was here this morning, and gave me some particulars of the present condition of the town— Both branches of its business greatly declined— The waggons laden with granite passing daily in the road before my gates are certainly not one fifth part in number what they were last Summer, when they had already considerably fallen off—the Shoe and boot business fares still worse— The Curtis’s who kept at least thirty men constantly employed have dismissed them all.— Afternoon visit from Mrs Forbes, with her Son John— A Sister of Thomas H. Perkins, I had a slight acquaintance with her before her marriage, and do not remember to have seen her since— How changed! and through how many vicissitudes she has passed. She now resides on Milton Hill; in an elegant house built for her by her Son, when he had returned rich from China— But he has returned to China to get rich again, and now is involved in the troubles there and will probably be obliged to come home. Josiah Adams junr was here at Sunset— Much dissatisfied with the decision of H. L Ellsworth the Commissioner of Pensions that his barkcutter is not entitled to a patent, and yet afraid to incur the risk and expense of appealing from it— He asked my advice which I gave him but which he will not take— Mr Beale and his two daughters were here this Evening.— He is very earnestly pressing my Son’s wife to assume the presiding Station at the Pic-Nic projected by the Ladies of Quincy, and to which those of the whig party throughout the whole County are to be invited.— I brought up this day the recent arrears of my Diary, and have none left of the last thirteen Months— I waded through the Article upon Transcendentalism in Brownson’s Boston Quarterly Review— Hypocritic, perhaps self-delusive Atheism, into which every man irretrievably falls, who begins by setting aside the Bible, and betakes himself to the standard of reason to measure the infinite and the finite—spirit and matter—God and the Universe— All such speculations find no end, in wandering mazes lost— They are all words differently significant to different minds and understood by none— The Germans Schelling and Hegel and Schleiermacher, were novelties to me, as prodigious metaphysicians; and I read also an Article upon Beethoven of whom I had heard as a composer of sundry Symphonies, but whom I now recognize as a wonder of the world.

Thursday  Having retrieved the recent arrears of my diary, I began this day the assortment of my Letters, received many, of which however I packed in my chest to follow me from Washington— This was the first clear morning since I reached home, and I went up to see the Sunrise from the corner of Charles’s house— I finished the reading of Brownson’s Articles on Transcendentalism, and on the labouring Classes— The disorganizing principles of politics, morals, and religion—which belonged to the most ferocious and bloody period of the French Revolution are returning upon us all their savage brutality, modified, by hypocritical professions of religion— Brownson has been successively a universalist minister, an avowed atheist, a Unitarian minister, a newspaper politician, and a democratic pamphleteer— Mr Van Buren has given him the place of Steward of the Marine Hospital at Chelsea, and he earns his stipend by undermining the foundations of civil Society. He is the Editor and almost only writer of a periodical pamphlet called the Boston Quarterly Review, the main objects of which are to unsettle all faith in religion, and to kindle inextinguishable War between the different classes of men— He assumes the mask of profound reverence for Christianity and its founder; but fills his sheets with furious invectives against Priests—and by Priests he means the whole body of the clergy of every denomination— His invective against them is in general terms, without specification and without exception—to expose them to public hatred and obloquy— Next he rails against all the employing class of the people, whom he arraigns as oppressors and tyrants over the labouring classes, whom he instigates to exterminating and indiscriminate butchery against them— He distinctly avows that Slavery is a much preferable condition to that of labourers at wages; and proclaims without hesitation or disguise that the only remedy to raise the labouring classes to his proper level is to abolish the relation between the employer and the workman, and to abolish all hereditary property— He then says that his party must not be held responsible for this particular doctrine, for it belongs exclusively to himself: but that he is sure it must ultimately prevail.— Robert Owen, Fanny Wright, Abner Kneeland, Garrison, Brownson and Emerson are all of one school, and all by different instruments are inflaming to fury the passions of mankind against one another— Is it not every man’s duty to take the field against them— I answered the Letter from Thomas Adams junr. which I had received at Washington respecting the proposed Pic Nic of the Ladies next Month— I read also the Mercator of Plautus, and the translation of it by George Coleman— A Translation itself from the Greek of Philemon— There is nothing of a Merchant in it except the purchase of a slave harlot for the possession of whom the father and son are rivals— The girl boasts of her expertness at weaving. The moral of the play is, that a beautiful girl is a very proper keepsake for a young man, but a very bad one for an old bell wether— The plot is simple and inartificial— Charles and his wife spent the Evening here— Mary quite unwell.

Alpheus Spear was here this morning and settled with me, for two quarters of the Mount Wollaston farm rent, ending the 31st. of March last— Nearly the whole of one Quarter’s rent is absorbed in Bills for repairs—and he told me crustily enough that he could not pay the third Quarter’s rent due the 30th. of June— He complained bitterly, that he could not get paid for any thing, and that the town have treated him with barbarous cruelty, by defeating him in a suit at law, which he in wanton obstinacy commenced against them, for denying to his children the right of attending one of the town Schools, upon a doubtful question, within which of two School districts, his dwelling house is situated— This is a hard working, industrious, ignorant obstinate, self-conceited man, ruined, body, mind and estate by the prevalence of the democracy.— Rival and competitor of Harvey Field, his mind was first unsettled by Harvey’s election two years successively as a representative of the Town in the Legislature of the Commonwealth— Alpheus’s quarrelsome disposition, and his Lawsuit with the town blasted all his hopes of election for himself, but he canvassed successfully for his brother Lemuel who was elected for the year 1839. and in attendance on the General Court caught his death— In the progress of political and religious excitement Alpheus became last Winter became raving distracted, till he was bled and blistered into comparative sobriety; but he is even now on the verge of fractious and fretful insanity. He grumbled about a want of much fencing upon the farm till I told him the lease had not much longer to run, and that when it should expire, I contemplated raising the rent— From the prospects of his present condition he will be no longer a trusty tenant—though I shall have much difficulty and no small hazard to supply his place— I called at the Quincy Stone Bank, made a deposit there, and left my book to be balanced— I then rode with John Kirke, and my Grandson Charles Francis to the Mount Wollaston Beach and took a Seawater Bath, according to my ability with my crippled right arm— Charles went to Boston and returned home to dine— Brought me a Letter from Dr Frothingham, which I answered this afternoon— I had also answered a Letter from Mr A. E. Silliman, President of the New-York, Mercantile Library Association, inviting me to deliver a Lecture before them next November— I declined— Harvey Field was here this afternoon; teeming with the whig Ladies Pic Nic, to which he wished me to invite the future Governor John Davis and his wife, and to dine with me— He wants also to sell me some clapboards to cover a barn, and to trade with me for some poor Lands for house lots.

                "text": "8. V. Saturday  Showery day— Mary quite sick; confined to her chamber— I am dissatisfied with my waste of time without knowing how—seeming to myself day after day, exceedingly busy and finding the day gone, without leaving a trace of usefulness behind— I visited my grounds; garden, nursery, seminary, orchard, all overgrown with weeds—great numbers of my seedling trees perished; others suffering from drought—insects—worms, and causes unknown, for which I am unable to devise a remedy.— The seedling appletree, near my old hickory, and the seed of which was sown in October 1833. bears fruit this year; so that I have my own experience to prove that an apple-tree may bear fruit the seventh year from the seed; but why that tree more than all the rest has been of so rapid growth, and so precocious bearing is a mystery the secret of which I shall never discover.— The one Philadelphia Maple, of a row in the seminary, the seed of which I sowed on the 1st. of June 1835. is about fifteen feet high, and measuresinches round the stock at the surface of the ground. Most of the Medford Appletrees planted in October 1830 are in full bearing— The thrifty and fast growing trees, are the Buttonwood, Ash, English white Oak and Elm— Of these trees, if I were now 30 years of age, I would raise a forest covering many acres, with an intermixture of red and white Oaks, and of shagbark hickory, horse chesnut and white walnut— One of my Nettle trees ten years old bears berries for the first time.— The dwarf Apple-tree; barren last year bears abundantly now; but the fruit is stunted, blighted and worm eaten The look of all the apples, pears and peaches is very unpromising— Both parts of the divided blackjack oak are alive; but the stem of the one in the Nursery has died down within a foot of the ground, and there thrown out a shoot already five feet high—the one transplanted to the garden has died down to the ground, and thrown out shoots from the root— The two Medford Apple-tree stocks which had been girdled by field mice, and which Mr E. Price Greenleaf budded last summer have taken, and are growing, tolerably well— The Orchard Nursery is so totally overgrown with gigantic weeds, that I can only perceive that at least four fifths of the seedling fruit-trees have perished and the remaining fifth have made no growth— My interest in these plantations is a dream, passing away— I have found, and begun to read the 4th volume of Graham’s history of the United States which I had mislaid last Summer, while reading the third— I read also Edward Everett’s Address delivered before the Mercantile Library Association on the 13th. of September 1838. upon accumulation, property, capital and credit— An Admirable, eloquent, argumentative, and affecting discourse. There is with it an amusing poem by James T. Fields, one of the young men who recently visited me. At Sunset, I went to Charles’s house— He and his wife came afterwards down and spent the Evening here. "

                "text": "9. IV:45. Sunday— Sun-rose at 5. beclouded.  Heard Mr Lunt this morning, from 1. Corinthians 14.19. “Yet in the Church, I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.” This was the second part of Mr Lunt’s discourse of last Sunday Morning, against the atheism now fermenting in this Country in the shape of what they call trancendentalism— He was very animated and eloquent; but there are grave difficulties in the subject which he discussed; and others in the text and in the Chapter which contains it upon which he did not touch— The preceding Chapter, in the small compass of 13 verses sets forth the supremacy of Charity as the first and greatest of the Christian virtues, and in which the Apostle seems to include the whole sum and substance of Christianity. That chapter alone gives the key to the purest and most perfect code of morals, ever promulgated to the race of Man— Let that chapter alone be impressed upon the heart, and carried out in the conduct of men, and this world would be a paradise regained— The 14th. Chapter is a comparative estimate of the faculties of speaking a variety of tongues, and of prophesy the latter of which is much preferred over the former— But Faith—Hope, Charity are all acquirable properties, attainable by human energy and exertion— The gifts of speaking tongues and of prophesy were preternatural, and the exercise of them seems to have been hardly a fit subject for exhortation— The argument in the chapter depreciates the gift of tongues, as if it was the practice of those who professed it, to speak in languages which the heares did not understand— The word unknown in the text, is an interpolation—not in the original greek— But when the miraculous gift of tongues was bestowed on the apostles on the day of Pentecost, it was not that they should speak to any one in an unknown tongue; but that the should speak to each in his own— Throughout this chapter, prophesy evidently means preaching and not prediction— Mr Degrand came out from Boston, and dined, and spent the day and Evening with us.— Mr Lunt’s text after dinner was from 1. John: 2.15. “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world— If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” A somewhat beaten subject, but Mr Lunt’s discourses are always interesting— At the close of the afternoon he requested all those who took an interest in the theological institution at Cambridge to remain and hear a communication which he had received relating thereto— It was a written statement shewing the condition of the school, and that unless 10,000 dollars can be raised and added to its funds it must be shut up and abandoned— Mr Lunt said that a collection would be taken up next Sunday afternoon, for the contribution of this Society towards, raising the sum required— President Quincy and his Son were here after Meeting— George W. Beale junr. and Mr Wales, who returned with Degrand to Boston— E. Price Greenleaf engaged to call on me to-morrow afternoon— Time for reading engrossed by company. "

                "text": "10. IV. Monday. Saw the Sun rise 5.1. Crystal clear  Mr Nathaniel Curtis, my Co-executor of the Will of Ward Nicholas Boylston, was here this morning with an account of Administration for the last three years which he has prepared to present to the judge of probate for the County of Norfolk, who is to hold his Court in this town to-morrow.— He and Mrs Boylston will come for that purpose to-morrow.— There is a small spot of Land in Corn Court Boston, belonging to the Estate, about the sale of which he has been in Treaty, first with the Suffolk and afterwards with the Massachusetts Bank. He had a Letter from a young lawyer, N. Bowditch, Counsel for the Bank, questioning the validity of Mr Boylston’s recorded title to the land.— The original deed he says, is dated in 1724. and he supposes there may be some claim in the right of Mr Boylston’s Aunt Mrs Gill, and also in Mrs Elmsley, and in the heirs of the late admiral Hallowell.— Mr Bowditch enquires also as to the right of the Executors to sell the Land, and proposes that they should insert the Deed a Warranty in their own names; but this we have heretofore agreed in no case to do.— The form of all our deeds expressly excludes it— The Will gives the Executors power to sell real Estate, with the restriction, that those portions of it which came from his ancestors shall be the last sold— Mr Curtis had proposed to grant a lease for 999 years; but Mr Bowditch thinks that this might by a late Statute of the Commonwealth be considered as a sale in fee-simple. (Revised Statutes of Massachusetts p. 411) I desired Mr Curtis to prepare a copy of the deed of 1724. and to look up the indentures between Mr Boylston and his brother and Sister, by which they conveyed to him all their rights in Estates coming from their common ancestors in this Country— A young shoemaker, named Horace Faxon, son of Benjamin Faxon came to enquire, if I could accomodate his father with a loan of 500 dollars for a year— No.— The new married couple from Fishkill landing, Mr Whittemore, and Louisa de Wint were here last afternoon— They were married last Tuesday— He is 21. She 18. and they look like two children eloped from school— Whittemore is the son of an inventor of a machine for making wool cards, of whom I have some recollections half a century old— It is said he made a large fortune by his invention, of which this youth inherits a part. Mr E. Price Greenleaf came and visited with me, my garden, Nursery and seminary. He examined several apple and pear trees which he budded for me last August, and most of which have succeeded— He engrafted also last Spring an old pear-stock with sundry slips of Bartlett pears, which had once or twice failed before, but now succeeded: we found on two trees nests of voracious worms.— Peter Turner was here this Evening, and persuaded me to lend him 50 dollars for a week— This succession of visitors, absorbed the day from Breakfast time. Charles spent the Evening here; and his wife with Mary who is yet confined to her chamber— I wrote a Letter of five lines to Mr Grattan the British Consul at Boston, and have read the first Chapter of the 4th volume of Grahame’s History.

Mr Curtis, and Mrs Boylston came about 11—we signed the account as Executors of the will of Ward Nicholas Boylston—which had been prepared by Mr Curtis; and we then attended the probate Court, held at French’s tavern, by the judge Sherman Leland, who administered the oath to us all, but declined examining the vouchers produced by Mr Curtis, observing that all the interests in the Estate were represented by the Executors themselves— Mr Curtis and Mrs Boylston dined with us, and also my Son and his wife— I went with Charles this Evening to Mr Quincy’s where Mrs Charles had already gone to take tea; and where we found Mrs Isaac P. Davis, and Miss Phelps, preceptress to Mrs Quincy’s children— I contracted a sort of engagement with Mr Curtis, to make a trip with him towards the close of this month to Halifax— There is a small property in that Province subject to the disposal of Mr Ward N. Boylston’s Executors, and upon which Mrs Elmsley has some claim— The agent there has not been punctual in the settlements of his accounts; and Mr Curtis thinks it expedient that we should look to him, in person— He left also with me a considerable budget of papers, concerning a deed of gift in October 1818 from Ward N. Boylston to the Inhabitants of the Town of Princeton, for the benefit of the Congregational Society of which the Revd Samuel Clarke was then the Pastor— The town and parish being then the same— And at the same time he gave 500 dollars, to be loaned out in small sums to industrious and frugal young men, each for three years, with interest to accumulate, till it should be sufficient, to build a Hall for Town-Meetings, on the land— With family vaults under it, as a cemetery for himself and his family— And by his Will there is a bequest of 1000 dollars for the same purposes; to be paid if the Executors think proper after the decease of Mrs Boylston.—18 June 1832. Mr Samuel Clarke was dismissed from his Office as Pastor of the Princeton Congregational Society.— 19. June 1833 John P Cowles was settled in his place— 23. Decr. 1833. The Parish organized itself as a corporation separate and distinct from the town— 30. Octr. 1834. Mr Cowles was dismissed from his pastoral office— 26. Octr. 1836. Elijah Demond was settled and 8 Novr. 1839. dismissed from the same Office; since which they have no settled Minister— The Inhabitants of Princeton have instituted a suit in Chancery to ascertain in whom the donation and bequest are now vested, and they have made the Executors of Mrs Boylston’s Will, parties to the suit— Mr Curtis on the 23d. of June last addressed a Letter to the Selectmen of Princeton, expostulating with them, against their being involved in the costs of a suit in which they have no interest, and there is a Letter from Mr Emory Washburn disclaiming all disposition to annoy them.

IV:20— Wednesday—  Bath in the mount Wollaston Creek, at half-tide and low water; but Mr Daniel Greenleafs wharf is in ruins, and the bottom of the creek is so deep with mud, that it is a very inconvenient place for bathing. The Creek itself is rapidly filling up— Afternoon visit from Mr and Mrs Cruft. They are leading a strolling life; by the indulgence of a propensity, which has swayed him many years, and which he has communicated to her.— With a numerous family of children, they find nothing that attaches them to home— Sweet home is unintelligible to them— Home to them is bitter, sour, vapid, any thing but sweet— And so it is to great multitudes of our People in this Country—perhaps to the wealthy throughout the world— The facilities and rapidity of modern travel, give great additional impulse to this propensity— Home is an English word for which there is in the French language no corresponding term— Perhaps there is no stronger indication of National character than in words of peculiar significancy in the language spoken by them— The compound association of ideas in the English word home consists of elements which form the choicest and purests enjoyments of human life.— The word home carries us back to the place of our birth, to the tenderness and anxious solicitude of a mother’s love; to the cares bestowed upon us in childhood, to the affectionate kindness of family relations, of friends and neighbours— It is the place of conjugal, parental, filial, and fraternal endearments— The place where alone we can possess and exercise the practical blessings of freedom— The French language has no word including all these Sentiments— They have a favourite popular song, expressing them all in its first line— “Ou peut-on être mieux qu’au sein de sa famille.”— All this is embraced in the single word “home.” It is a great but very common misfortune of the wealthy to lose the relish for these enjoyments; which may be the result of sickness—of family discord, of casualties incident to the condition of human existence, and perhaps more than all of ennui. The best prevention to this last locomotive is literature— One of the most useful properties of the love of reading is the ligament which it adds to the ties which attach us to home—profound study can be no where else pursued— The vulgar adage that a rolling stone gathers no moss is pre-eminently true of intellectual culture— Travellers may collect facts and accumulate observations.— But travellers to escape from ennui, essentially indolent cannot abide the labour of collecting arranging and committing to writing useful information— Mr and Mrs Cruft returned a few days since from a tour to New-Jersey; and are to depart to-morrow upon an excursion down East— I walked this Evening to Mrs T. B. Adams’s, and found there her son John Quincy, and her sister Foster with her son Francis— Rode home with the Ladies. "

A day of entire leisure, with no interruption, save of a way-faring man—who stop’d at the door to beg, and said he was of the Livingston family of New-York. A vagabond, but apparently a man of education— About Sunset I went up to Charles’s house, and he and his wife came down with me and spent the Evening here— I wrote nothing but the Diary of yesterday, and an answer to a Letter from A. D. Bache President of the Girard Collage, Philadelphia— My time is absorbed by three different classes of reading, which scatter into many others— 1. The Daily Newspapers— Most unprofitable— I apologize to myself for yielding so much precious time to them, by the plea of necessity to keep up with the course of Events— 2. Grahame’s History of the United States of North America—Volume 4. The title is a Misnomer. It should have been called the History of the English Colonies in North America, from their Settlement, till their Declaration of Independence— 3. Jean Jacques Rousseau’s letter to D. Alembert on his recommendation of the Establishment of a Theatre at Geneva. Of the Newspaper reading, there remains nothing useful upon the Memory. The attention is distracted by such a multitude and variety of subjects that it fixes upon none. They succeed one another day after day, and have not even the privilege of the Lord Mayors day in the Dunciad, to live in Settles’s numbers, one day more The Boston Papers, Courier, Daily Advertiser, and Atlas, are now filled with election returns from North-Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana, and Alabama— All for the State Governments and all hitherto more or less favourable to the whigs, as the opposition to the present Opposition Administration of the General Government call themselves. The imposture of Jackson and Van-Buren democracy, would seem to be drawing to its Catastrophe—and yet falsehood, injustice and wrong are permitted by divine Providence to have such sweeping sway over the affairs of men that I scarcely dare indulge the hope that the day of retribution will come even when it seems to approach— Twelve years I have submitted almost in silence to the foulest and basest aspersions upon myself, my administration and my father, of which Jackson took the lead by denouncing me, in his inaugural speech; while at the same time the remnants of the old Hamilton federalists assailed me with a furious onset here in my native Commonwealth. It would have been a waste of time and toil, to have attempted my defence, hitherto. The public ear was not open to me and I have lived slumbering under a cloud— Is the time arriving for me to speak? or must I go down to the grave and leave posterity to do Justice to my father and to me? In humble submission I prostrate myself before the footstool of God, and implore the act of his Spirit, to nerve my will and to prescribe my path "

Call at Quincy stone Bank, where I took my balanced book and return checks— Just after noon I rode with Charles’s wife, her children Louisa Catherine Charles and Henry with his Nurse Catherine, and Mary Louisa, John Kirke and Jeremy Leary to the beach behind Mr Quincy’s house, where they have a bathing house— Kirke and Charles bathed with me on the open beach— Jerry kept the Carriage and horses, and the rest of the company bathed at the bathing house.— A drowsy weariness after dinner succeeded my bath— A short Letter to Mr Frye, and five lines to John Butterfield Lowell, declining to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum at that place next November, were all the writing that I could accomplish besides my diary day. Charles went to Boston and returned home to dine— I went up and saw the Sunset from his porch, at 7:4 by the American Almanac, but about ten minutes before, just a disk North of the apex of the sloping hill in front of the porch—the hill interposing between the Sun and the horizon— Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us, and we had visits from Mr and Mrs Quincy and Miss Sophia Quincy.— My regular reading progress in two books at once is slow.— The 4th. Volume of Grahame’s History begins with the year 1757. and the 5th. chapter of the 10th. Book embraces three years of time.— The inglorious campaign of 1757. which is attributed in considerable degree to the incapacity of Lord Loudoun, yet one of the Counties of Virginia still bears his name— The controversy between him and the Colonial Legislature of Massachusetts Bay, about quartering troops involved the question of the enforcement in the Colonies of Acts of Parliament. The General Court in a remonstrance written by T. Hutchinson admitted the unlimited authority of Parliament to extend their Legislation over the Colonies when named; but not otherwise.— Loudoun was superseded by Abercrombie, of whom the historian speaks not less contemptuously. In 1758 the change of Ministry took place which brought William Pitt, afterwards Earl of Chatham to the head of Affairs, and with it a remarkable change from weakness, languor and discomfiture to active energy, vigorous action and success— The Conquest of Cape-Breton was effected in 1758—and the repulse at Ticonderoga was suffered; where Lord Howe was killed— The reduction of Forts Frontignac and Duquesne was of the same year, and the substitution as commander in Chief of the British forces, of Amherst instead of Abercrombie. The year 1759 is signalized by the campaign which terminated in the conquest of Quebec and the memorable battle on the plains of Abraham; where the commanders of the hostile armies—Wolfe and Montcalm were slain—as if Providence intended to foreshew the final event of the War to both Nations. The account of the death of Wolfe is deeply affecting. "

IV:45 Saturday  Saw Sun rise at 5.6—and set 7.2— but behind the summit of the hill 6.55  Thomas Adams junr. came this morning, and speaking of the proposed Pic-Nic, whig Lady party to be held here on the 3d. of next Month, asked me, if I would write to Ogden Hoffman and Serjeant S. Prentiss and invite their attendance to make speeches.— I observed that having from various considerations peculiarly applicable to myself, felt it an obligation of duty, to abstain from giving my attendance at any public meeting during the pendency of the Presidential election, I considered it as a necessary consequence that I ought not to take any part in the formation of such meetings; as there would be an obvious inconsistency, in my giving invitations to others to attend meetings, which I do not attend myself. He said Mr Prentiss was now on a visit to his relations in the State of Maine, and was to address a public meeting at Portland next Tuesday— He had some thoughts of going down to Portland on Monday, to hear him, and to invite him to come to the Pic Nic—and he asked me, if, in case he should conclude to go, I would give him a Letter to Mr Prentiss; which I promised I would— I had next a morning visit from Mr Lunt, and a long conversation with him; or rather a talk, for it was almost entirely on my side— I spoke of the pernicious doctrines promulgated with so much perverse zeal, and mischievous pertinacity at this time, and connected with the politics of the day.— He mentioned the collection which he had given notice last Sunday, would be taken up to-morrow, in aid of the funds of the theological institution at Cambridge and said that Mr Whitney and he had thought this was the best mode of proposing a contribution for that object to the members of the religious Society here— But he was apprehensive that some prejudice against the appropriation had arisen from the fact that Mr Emerson’s transcendentalism had been first broached there— I said I had no doubt it was so; and that I must acknowledge, my share of that prejudice. He said some of the professors of that institution, were among the most strenuous and vehement opponents of the transcendental school; and had even written against it. He further said he had lately been on a visit to Plymouth, where he had heard enquiry made whether I should be a Candidate for re-election as a member of the House of Representatives of the United-States; and some suggestion of an intention to address the inquiry to me— I said it was perhaps high time for me to retire definitively from all public life, and I was receiving daily admonitions of the fact from the continual erosions of Time and from the casualties of chance. But having as yet received none from my Constituents, I thought I should leave to them the determination whether I should represent them two years longer in the Councils of the Nation, or bid adieu to the service of my Country at the close of the present Congress— Charles’s wife and family went with Mary-Louisa to the bath this day, but I thought it best to intermit— I answered a letter from Henry R. Schoolcraft, informing me of my election as an honorary member of the Michigan Historical Society— Louisa C. Smith came out from Boston— "

Mr Lothrop, Minister of the Brattle street church Boston, but having his Summer-residence on Milton hill, was the preacher for Mr Lunt this day. His morning text was from Romans 10.10. [“]For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness”—a Discourse upon Faith—ingenious, discriminating, argumentative, written in a style of polished elegance and bating a little affection of manner, well delivered— He traced Religious conviction to three sources—Reason—Experience—Faith and the last as belief founded upon Reason and Experience— He distinguished between the Faith of Reason, that of Experience and that of the heart; the belief as described in the text, unto righteousness— The faith of reason is a cold, unimpassioned conclusion of the Judgment, not dependent upon the will, and liable to err from all defects of that faculty— The faith of experience is the belief of facts as they are made known to us by the testimony of our own senses; also greatly liable to err—but the faith unto righteousness is the belief of the heart founded on our confidence in the testimony of others.— This belief is one of the Laws of Nature implanted in the heart of man: for man is so constituted that he must and will believe the testimony of his fellow man, unless he can perceive some motive of the informer to deceive— This is the foundation of historical faith, and the principal basis of belief in the historical part of Christianity is the notorious fact that the evangelists who wrote the historical books could have no possible motive for falsifying the narrative— Mr Lothrop’s analysis of faith was confined to its passive signification of belief in the testimony of others— He took no note of it as the motive of action; as the reciprocal basis of confidence of others— It is the connection existing between these two properties of Faith and their mutual dependence upon each other in the human mind that I wish to see analysed and illustrated, and will attempt it if I can command the time— After the morning service, Mr Lothrop read the same statement of the condition of the theological school at Cambridge which had been read last Sunday by Mr Lunt; and gave notice that the collection would be taken up this afternoon. Mr Lothrop and Charles dined with us.— As we were going over the Hill after dinner to Meeting we saw a large Steamer passing rapidly up the harbour, which we took for the Acadia expected from Liverpool. Mr Lothrops afternoon text was from Colossians 1.9.—[“]that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom, and spiritual understanding.” The collection for the theological institution was taken up; and produced about 40 dollars:— I read the first Sermon of Barrow upon [“]quietness and doing our own business”— Doctrines suited to the restoration age of Charles the second; but not to this time and Country.— Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us.— And we had a visit from G. W. Beale junr. "

They were also fluting out another Pilaster of nearly the same dimensions.— Mr Hobart and Mr Sawyer, two young men, members of the Mercantile Library Association came out and reiterated the urgent invitation to me, to deliver their next Anniversary Address; in the course of the ensuing Month— I had not yet definitively made up my mind, but told them I would send them an answer before the end of this week— And Peter Turner came to ask me to wait till tomorrow morning for the payment of his note to me; which I readily agreed to do— Charles went to Boston and returned to dine— He brought me one hundred copies of my revenue speech for Mr John Fine; and the two Volumes of Bancroft’s History of the United States which I am to read— Also a check for 1060 dollars 76 cents from Mr Nathaniel Curtis, and notice to attend the probate Court at Boston Tuesday the 27th. instt. upon the claim of the Estates of the two Moses Gill’s, on the Administration of Thomas Boylston— Charles gave me also sundry securities of property— Deeds and certificates, a list of which I propose to enter upon this Diary to-morrow morning— The Steamer which we saw go up the harbour yesterday was not the Acadia from Liverpool, as we supposed, but a boat from Portland—Maine— But the Acadia did arrive this morning, after a passage of 12 days and 14 hours, the shortest ever made from England to Boston—and she had touched to land the mail, and passengers at Halifax—where she lay 6 hours at the wharf— This travelling by Steam is producing wonder upon wonder in approximating to each other the inhabitants of the four Quarters of the Globe— Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us.— The day was wasted by me— I know not how— I sent a packet of pamphlets to H.

Mr Minot and Mr Curtis are members of that Committee, and came to enquire, if I would consent to be put in nomination for the Office of President of the Society— I felt myself honoured by the proposal and said I had only two objections against it— One the consciousness of my inefficiency for the Office; and the other a warm regard for the Phi beta kappa Society, and an aversion to join in any measure which would seem to have a bearing of hostility to them. They said that the members of the Phi beta kappa society had themselves originated the proposal of the general association, and almost universally favoured it— Mr Curtis read to me the report, to be made including a Constitution for the new Society— A President, two Vice-Presidents and 7. Directors are proposed for the organization of the Society— Judge Story and Edward Everett are proposed for Vice Presidents— I consented to place my name at their disposal— Josiah Quincy and his Lady came up on horseback and held a colloquy with Mrs Charles at Sunset, before the porch of her house.

Afternoon visits from Mr and Mrs Armstrong, and from Baron Maréchal, the Austrian Minister at Washington—with Mr Austin the Attorney General of the Commonwealth— I enquired of the Baron what we were to think of these rumours of Wars between France and England; brought by the last Steamers, from Liverpool, the Acadia, which arrived on Monday at Boston, after a passage of 12 days and 14 hours and the President arrived yesterday in 17 days at New-York— The Baron thinks there is no danger of War; and that the large armament of Louis-Philippe, is merely a demonstration of Louis-Philippe to put a responsibility upon his Minister, and thereby to get rid of him— The first part of the Evening I spent under Charles’s porch with him and Mr Lunt— Afterwards his wife and then himself were at our house— I attempt in vain to economise time for writing beyond the Diary of the day, and one short Letter— I despatched two packages with 50 copies in each of my revenue-bill Speech, to John Fine, Member of H.R.U.S. at Ogdensburg, St. Lawrence County, New-York, and an answer to an invitation from Samuel Lawrence, to address a public whig meeting at Lowell, which I declined— I continue the daily reading of about 20 pages of the 4th. volume of Grahame’s History of the United States, with which I am much less satisfied with than with the preceding volumes. The narrative until the close of the 7 years war and the conquest of Canada continues interesting, and in all the approaches or premonitory symptoms of the conflict between the Mother Britain and the Colonies, the bias of the Historian in favour of the Americans is constant and overruling— In the Appendix 3. p. 147. Is a statement with a proper mark of reprobation, that in the year 1764 there was despatched from England to America a pack of blood-hounds to assist the British troops in tracking the Indians— He says that the British never stooped to the employment of such auxiliaries, except in their contests with Indians, or with negro slaves.— There is some account from Soskiel of the Moravian Missions— The title of the 11th. Book is, the Progress of the States of North-America, till their Assumption of political Independence— The first chapter contains the account of the commercial restrictions subsequent to the Peace of 1763. and of the Stamp-act—but not a word about the argument in the case of the Writs of Assistance.— Grahame never saw the Massachusetts State Papers, nor Novanglus.

The youngest Son of this Joseph was Ebenezer, and he as has been usual in New-England inherited the family mansion and farm.— It is the old borough—English tenure, the reason of which is fully developed in the natural origin of it, by the law of nature operating upon the state of Society consequent upon the colonization of New-England— The settlers at Mount Wollaston received small grants of land proportioned to the number of heads in each family— As the children grew up to man’s estate— The sons one after another, and the daughters by marriage departed from the paternal fire-side, and went abroad to find new Settlements for themselves leaving the youngest son, to cultivate the farm with the father, and to hold possession of it after his decease.— Thus it was that the first Joseph, the youngest Son, or youngest but one, of the Patriarch Henry, being only 20 years of age, at his death in 1646. inherited the malt house and brewery, which he occupied through a long life and left to his youngest Son Peter— The elder Son, Joseph junr had emigrated from the brew house, and pitched on this spot, a little hermitage remote from the high way; which in 1736, he dying, left to his youngest Son, Ebenezer, whose Son of the same name was, the father of the two brothers, who now at ages of 79 and 77. are still in common possession of the Estate— We found Deacon Josiah at work on his Potato field, and he walked with us to view the ground staked out for the road, from Braintree to the borders of Milton— As usual it trenches largely on my land, and passes very near to the houses of the two brothers— On returning home I found at our door Mr Solomon Lincoln of Hingham, and Mr Fearing, originally of Hingham, but now of Boston— Mr Lincoln enquired whether I should be a candidate for re-election, and whether I proposed to attend any of the public Meetings in the District preparatory to the November elections. I said I did not intend to be present at any of the public meetings; and that whether I should be a candidate for re-election or not would depend upon the people of the District themselves— I should not offer myself; nor should I decline—especially as for the first time since I have represented the district, a formal and avowed opposition to my re-election was announced. He then enquired if I proposed to address the People of the District through the Newspapers as I have heretofore done.— I said I thought I should— Charles spent the Evening here— His wife was unwell, and did not come down.

October upon German Literature— And if I have preserved the Letter, she asks for it, for that purpose. This put me upon the search for my files of Letters of the last ten years, which I found in the great confusion, and after the waste of at least three hours, I was yet unable to find the files of 1831— This is an admonition which I must not disregard to pursue connectedly the determination to assort all my manuscript papers so as to have them at my command— The only step towards which that I could now take was to gather and file upon two steel rings the keys of 14 wooden chests in which most of my manuscript papers are contained— Eleven of these chests are now here, and three at Washington; one of them packed up, and expected soon here— We had this afternoon a very heavy thunder gust differing from those which usually happen at this Season: the shower coming first and the thunder and lightening afterwards— It came up very suddenly and the clouds at no time of it wholly covered the sky. Mrs John Codman, wife of the orthodox minister at Dorchester, was passing by, with Miss Allen, daughter of the President of Dartmouth college, and stop’d with us until the storm was over; about an hour— Mrs Codman gave us an affecting account of the last sickness and recent death of Mr Samuel Adams Welles, only grandson of Samuel Adams, who has left ready for the press a Life of his grand-father with vouchers to comprize Six Octavo Volumes— Mr Welles’s last 3 years have been a period of excruciating pains and after the amputation of a leg, a long agony of death.

Perkins, who visited us on the 5th. instt. with another John Forbes, not as I then supposed him her Son; but of James Grant Forbes, another brother of my old deceased friend and Classmate John Murray Forbes— Ralph Bennet Forbes my Classmate’s younger brother was like himself a martyr to the gout, and in his last days, dependent, with his family upon his brother John for support— But Ralph Bennet’s eldest Son, of the same name went out very young to China, and in a very few years made an affluent fortune— This John was also there and alike successful.— They came back, and built for their mother the elegant house on Milton hill where she now resides. John built and resides in a cottage near the same spot— But Ralph after his return was unfortunate, became poor again, and went again to China, to reinstate himself in prosperity— He is yet there, unless expelled with the other American Merchants from Canton, in consequence of the Opium quarrel between the English and the Chinese. Mr John Forbes is in great anxiety on his brother’s account, and asked many questions of my opinions, both with regard to facts and principles, involved in this controversy— I told him I was very imperfectly informed of the facts; that I could not possibly bring myself to believe that the British would attempt the conquest of China; and I believed that their demonstration of War, was made merely for effecting an accommodation with the Chinese Government upon as good terms as they could obtain, but that if they do pursue the War they will suffer no neutral commerce with China, and that all the American commercial establishments at Canton will be broken up. He asked if they had the right? I answered no, but that in commercial warfare, the British measure of right was power; and they had no other— He said that many persons entertained the opinion that a British army of 15000 men, the force which they have ordered there, will easily accomplish the conquest of all China; there being no organized military force, and the people having no weapons except bows and arrows. I said that with such an immense population, invasion itself would soon organise a defensive military force, and if they should have no other weapons than the stones of the Streets they would be sufficient to crush a European army of 15000 men. He said he had, and would send me a published statement of the facts— "

Mr Lunt preached this morning from 2 Timothy 2.5. “And if a man also, strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.” This was his third discourse against the new, or old vamped up transcendental doctrines— He waxes warm as he proceeds, and gave this day a broadside at Carlyle without naming him for having in his history of the French Revolution, dressed up the character of Mirabeau into a pattern of patriotism— The deadly sophistry of the transcendental school consists in the alliance of Atheism with hypocrisy.— The characteristic of the age is to unsettle all established opinions, and to put into perpetual question all the foundations of human Society— We are to argue pro and con—whether parricide be a crime or a virtue; whether property, is by the law of Nature, or the mere creature of conventional law—whether the contract of marriage constitutes an obligation of duty restrictive of promiscuous social intercourse—in short whether justice or force is at the root of all human institutions— In the process of this argument the transcendentals not only dig up the cornerstones of human Society; but pronounce them decayed, rotten and worthless— The dregs and the froth of the cauldron are boiled up into one impure and poisonous compound and administered to the body politic for healing medicine.— Religion is sapped and undermined by this fraudulent philosophy; the labouring classes are instigated to hatred and violence against the proprietors, and the elements of a civil war of extermination, are stimulated into deadly conflict with one another— Mr Lunt has not yet finished with this subject, but with discourse upon it again— Mr Whitney preached in the afternoon, from Job 14.14.— “All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.”— Upon Death— Mr Whitney has been forty years the settled minister of this Church and Congregation, and he cannot have long to wait for his change— The marks of age are sinking upon him deeper and deeper, every day. The argument of his discourse that Death was not to be dreaded as an evil, but as the necessary proper, and happily devised termination of life, which must of course have an end.— I read two Sermons of Barrow—the second upon quietness, and doing our own business—and the first upon the Love of God.— The following extract is from the Discourse on quietness. “Especially we should not make ourselves parties, in any faction, where both sides are eager and passionate, for then, even they who have the juster cause, are wont to do unjust things in which, it is hard for any man engaged not to have share, at least not to undergo the imputation of them: it is wisdom therefore in such cases, to hold off, and to retain a kind of indifferency; to meddle with them is (as the Wise man saith) to take a dog by the ears; which he that doth, can hardly take care enough of his fingers.”— What a seasonable admonition to me! Charles spent the Evening here. We had two ends of thunder showers, refreshing the air, which has been at sultry Summer heat the last three days. "

Adams, dined and spent the day here, and went home this Evening— Her mother went last week to Medford, and is yet there. Charles went to Boston and to Medford, to return with his wife to-morrow— There was a light thunder shower in the course of this day; I had no interruptions of visitors or of business, and yet passed an unprofitable day— I despatched a parcel of my pamphlet discourses, with a Letter to I. K Tefft corresponding Secretary of the Georgia Historical Society, in answer, and return to a Diploma received from him a few days since, as an honorary member of that Society, with the first volume of their Transactions.— My attempts to arrange and assort my files of Letters for the last ten years have as yet only involved them in greater confusion— I have not found the files of 1831. but in assorting alphabetically the files of summer and Autumn of 1834, which on my sudden, and terrible call to Washington to witness the last moments of my dear and ever lamented son John I had left in chaotic disorder here, and had until now, never since inspected, I found, out of place, and time, the very Letter from Charles Follen, 1. Decr. 1831. for which the Letter from Mr Samuel Cabot, received last week had set me, upon the search— I enclosed and despatched it this day to Mr Cabot— I have a Letter from the Revd. Josiah Adams of Parkersburgh Virginia, containing some genealogical enquiries— I began a Letter in answer to him, which I intended should not exceed five lines, but in which I was interrupted to view from Charles’s porch the setting of the Sun; for which, clear and beautiful as it was, I was not quite a Sun’s disk too late. My Miscellaneous and involuntary reading continues desultory as ever— I have now just read Milton’s Areopagitica; A Speech for the Liberty of unlicensed printing—to the Parliament of England— This speech was not delivered but published in 1645. against an order of the Rump Parliament, prohibiting all publications without the imprimatur—published he says as a certain testimony if not a trophy of his Country’s Liberty— [“]For this is not the Liberty which we can hope, that no grievance ever should arise in the Commonwealth, that let no man in this world expect; but when complaints are freely heard, deeply considered and speedily reformed, then is the utmost bound of civil liberty attained that wise men look for.”— The argument against restrictions upon the press is founded on two principles & authority—the practice of all republican Government, before that time having been adverse to such restrictions—and 2. that the corrections of the abuses of the press belong to the pulpit and not to legislation. The style is throughout oratorical, repeatedly addressing the imaginary auditory in the second person— Lords and Commons of England!— The discourse is replete with beautiful imagery, and fortified with cogent argument; though in antiquated language.— The writers and speakers of modern English can derive little benefit from any of the composers of that age, and from none less than from Milton.

I went to Boston in the Carriage alone, and took with me the 4th. volume of Grahame’s history of the United States to pass the time— I stop’d first at Dr Frothingham’s, but he was not at home— At Charles’s office I found Mr Nathaniel Curtis, and Charles himself soon after came in from Medford— Mr Spooner was also there— I went with Mr Curtis, to the probate office, where was the judge, Willard Phillips, and Mr Fuller the Administrator upon the Estates of the two Moses Gill’s— A question had remained over upon the allowance by the judge last November of my Account as Administrator de bonis non, with the Will annexed of Thomas Boylston, whether the amount of the Note of the second Moses Gill to Mrs Boylston of 5. Jany 1830. for 984 dollars 78 cents with interest should be deducted from the sum to be paid over by me to the Representative of the Gill’s— Mr Fuller still doubted whether as Administrator, he could consent to this deduction, without making himself liable to the creditors who had claims on the Gill estates. I then made a conditional offer, to relinquish on the part of Mr Boylston, the interest upon the Note amounting to 860:63. and the allowance of 600 dollars made by the judge to me as Administrator, if after deducting the amount of the Note I should be authorised to pay over the remainder to Mr Fuller for the heirs of the last Moses Gill—but I added this was not to be understood if the amount to be paid over by me, would go, not to the last Moses Gill’s heirs, but to claimants upon his or his uncle’s Estates, of the validity or justice of which I knew nothing. The judge urged the acceptance of this offer upon Mr Fuller, and said it could easily be accomplished in legal form—but Mr Fuller declined doing any thing without advice of Counsel— The judge therefore adjourned his decision to some future day, to be notified hereafter— I then went to Mr T. W. Ward’s Office; and returned to his clerk Mr Story, the single order for £10 Sterling, upon the Brothers Baring and Co. London, for which he returned to me the 50 dollar Bill, which he had taken for it— I went to the Store of P. and S. Sprague. 13. Commercial Wharf, and there received a set of three Bills at 3 days sight on the same Baring’s payable to me or my order, and upon which Mr Phineas Sprague gave me 2 dollars and 12 1/2 cents change for the 50 dollar Bill— I attended at Noon a Meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society, where numerous donations were received and the Chevalier Friederichsthal was elected a foreign member.— I went to Dr Frothingham’s, where I found Mrs Charles, returned from Medford with her daughter Louisa-Catherine— Charles and his wife, returned to Quincy before dinner— I called to see Mr Abbott Lawrence, just returned from the white Sulphur Virginia Springs, with his family very little improved in health.— R. G. Shaw, Dr Sewall of Washington, and Revd. Andrew Bigelow were there. I dined at T. L. Winthrop’s.— Met there Mrs George Sullivan—General Miller from South-America, George Bancroft and about 15 others— Thunder gust— After dinner I took up Charles’s daughter Louisa at Dr Frothingham’s, and returned to Quincy at the dusk of Evening.

Mr Loring from Hingham was here this morning with two young girls from Pawtucket visitors at Hingham, one of them a relative of Joseph L. Tillinghast the member of Congress from Rhode-Island— Mr Loring said they had fixed upon the day after tomorrow for the fishing party at Cohasset; and I promised to be at Hingham at 6 or half past 6 that day— I had much conversation yesterday with Mr Bancroft, upon the third volume of his History of the United States which is shortly to come out; and of which he told me that my father would be the hero— But I have learnt to estimate the assurances of Mr Bancroft at their value— I promised to shew him the original Letter of my father to Nathan Webb of October 1755. and the minutes of his journal upon his argument before the Governor and Council on the 18th. of Decr 1765. as one of the Counsel of the Town of Boston, upon their petition for the opening of the Courts of Justice without the use of stamps.— Mrs Lawrence had written me a note, inviting my company at her son’s rooms at Commencement this day— I called at their house yesterday to than her for the invitation, and offer my excuses, not intending to go to commencement— And I gave the same answer to Mr R. G Shaw, who gave me an invitation to the rooms of his Son, also to be graduated this day. I dined this day with my Son, and was conversing with him after dinner upon Plautus and his Translators French and English, when Mr E. Price Greenleaf came in with a copy of a Resolution, which he said had been adopted at a large whig meeting, that a committee be appointed to wait on me, and inform me that it is the wish of the whigs at Quincy, to invite the whigs of the 12th. congressional District, in particular, and the Electors generally to meet with them in Quincy, on an appointed day agreeable to me, to pay their respects to me, and request me, to favour them with an Address on the present state of the country, the present administration of the national government, and the prospects of the whig party— I told Mr Greenleaf that I was greatly obliged to the whigs of the town, for their kind proposal, and especially for the personal accommodation to me intended by calling the meeting here; but that I had already declined attending at a similar meeting to which I had been invited to be held at Rochester in the County of Plymouth, and at many others out of the District— I stated the reasons which had induced me to decline attendance at all the recent meetings considering it a duty resulting from my peculiar situation, and desired him to make them known to the whigs of Quincy, and suggest to them the wish that they would receive this informal answer rather than by sending a formal committee cause the necessity for a written answer from me for publication of my reasons, some of which were rather to be felt than argued— He said he would satisfy the whigs entirely with my answer.— Charles’s wife was very unwell all this day—and could not spend the evening with us— Charles himself did.

Fishing party— Quincy—  At half past five this morning, I left home in a Gig, with my son, and went to Mr Thomas Loring’s at Hingham where we breakfasted; with him and a Mr and Mrs Sprague living in his house; another young woman was also there, and the two little girls who came with him to Quincy on Wednesday. After breakfast I went with Mr Loring in his Gig, and the Revd. Mr Stearns with my Son to the small shed at Cohasset, whence we had been upon a fishing party last Summer. A small party soon assembled there now, and six or eight of us embarked from the rocks in a good sized Sail-boat and went out between four and five miles from the shore, and fished for cod and haddock—we changed our position once and caught about 30 fishes, of which I took nine.— At one O’Clock we brought the boat round and returned to the rocks. I should have liked much to continue fishing three hours longer, but the rest of the company were weary and sharp set for dinner, and impatient to return, to which I interposed no obstacle— The Revd. Mr Stearns, Minister of the Parish where Mr Charles Brooks was settled, Dr. John Brazer of Salem with his twin sons John and William, boys about twelve years of age, were of our party— The Chowder dinner company at the shed were about 30 in number among whom were Solomon, and Jotham and Jairus Lincoln, Edward Thaxter James C Doane and others whose names I could not retain— The Revd. Dr W. P. Greenwood, seemed to be in the last stage of a consumption.— After the chowder and some general conversation, I walked an hour with Dr Brazer and Mr Loring to and upon the beach; on returning from which we had a second dinner of fried fish and lemonade, after which I returned with Mr Loring to his house at Hingham, where by his invitation the whole company repaired together with Mr Josiah Quincy junr. and his Son Josiah, who had come at 6 in the evening instead of 6 in the morning, as he had been invited— We took tea at Mr Loring’s and with the light of a bright Aurora Borealis returned home, and alighted at my gate just before the 9. O’Clock Evening Bell.— There was a cold morning fog barely sufficient to discolour the Sun till we reached Cohasset—then a clear sky, smooth water and alternate calm and cool eastern breeze, barely enough to curl the surface of the glass; as fine an autumnal day as the earth ever rolled round her axis— The distant shores of Gloucester and Cape Ann and Gloucester, and the Light house at the entrance of Boston harbour on one side, and the Scituate meeting house on the other bounded the horizon, with the boundless Ocean, dotted with numerous spots of white canvas all over the scene— Mr Loring and Solomon Lincoln told me that the abolitionists of the 12th. Congressional District had held a meeting last Tuesday at Hanover twelve persons present and nominated Seth Sprague junr. as their Candidate for the 27th Congress— That the administration party would nominate John B. Turner, and that Joseph Morton Jackson the old Candidate for the present Congress would be set aside to his sore disappointment. "

I planted in the seminary the plumstones of the fruit brought from Mr Downing’s at Newburgh by Elizabeth C. Adams; and the four stones of the early Ann peach which we have this year from the tree— Mr Thomas P. Beal alighted from the Plymouth stage and spent an hour with me under great political excitement— The whole country throughout the Union is in a state of agitation upon the approaching presidential election such as was never before witnessed.— From the organization of the Government under the present Constitution of the United States, the nominations of Candidates for the Office of President were made in Caucus Convention by members of Congress—and by the members of the State Legislatures. The Congressional Caucus nomination of 1824 was in favour of William H. Crawford, and signally failed.— The State Legislature nominations produced only cross purposes; and have been superseded by party popular conventions, increasing in numbers till that of last May at Baltimore of the young men, to confirm the nomination of W. H. Harrison made before, by a select Caucus Convention at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, last December, amounted it was said to twenty thousand delegates— This has been followed by numerous assemblages in all the States where the opposition is in any strength, and not a week has passed within the last four months without a convocation of thousands of people, to hear inflammatory harangues against Martin Van Buren and his administration, by Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and all the principal opposition Orators in or out of Congress— I received earnest invitations to attend these Meetings and address the People at Nashville, Tennessee, Chillicothe Ohio, Wheeling Virginia, Baltimore, Alexandria, Georgetown, and many other places, all of which I declined both from general principles and from considerations specially and peculiarly applicable to myself— One of these assemblies was held yesterday by a public dinner given to Caleb Cushing by some of his constituents at Newburyport, and a Ball in the evening by him to them— I was invited also there but did not attend— Mr Webster and Mr Saltonstall were there, and a stump speech scaffold, and it is said a procession of 6000 people or more, and a dinner of 1800. Here is a revolution in the habits and manners of the people— Where will it end? These are party movements, and must in the natural progress of things become antagonistical— At the Baltimore meeting one of the marshals of the procession was killed upon the spot— These meetings cannot be multiplied in numbers and frequency without resulting in yet deeper tragedies— Their manifest tendency is to civil war.

                "text": "30. IV. Sunday.  Sun rose and set beclouded— Fair day.  Mr Lunt though much indisposed performed all the services of both parts of this day. His morning text was from 1. Corinthians 6:20—glorify God in your body, and in your Spirit, which are God’s— A Dissertation to show how it is possible for so poor a creature as man to glorify God— By his natural disposition, his experience of the world, his failure of success in his struggles for a respected standing in society, his infirm and alarming state of health, the prospects of a destitute family to survive him, and the warnings of history. Mr Lunt has not a very favourable opinion of mankind; and being of a meek and quiet Spirit, he thinks of himself almost as humbly as of mankind generally— Piety, tenderness, benevolence, with a tinge of melancholy pervade all his Sermons, but I have never been more affected and pleased with any discourse of his than this afternoon when his text was from Ruth 1.16. “And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God. 17. Where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.”— Mr Lunt began by remarking on the peculiar character of the Book of Ruth as distinguished from all the other books of the Scriptures— He said the Bible was generally spoken of as one book; but it was a collection of many books, of very different descriptions— He then enumerated the historical, poetical, prophetical books of the old Testament, the books of Job and of the Proverbs, without mentioning the Ecclesiastes or the Song of Solomon; but considered this Book of Ruth as differing from all the rest— I consider it as belonging to the historical class, an appendage to the book of Judges, and as most essential in tracing the genealogy of David and Solomon, and of Jesus Christ— Mr Lunt dwelt upon the transcendent excellence of the character of Ruth—upon her admirable fidelity and affectionate attachment to her mother in Law—upon her fortitude in the endurance of extreme indigence; upon her active exertions in gleaning the fields for the subsistence of Naomi—and he descanted upon the wonderful vicissitudes of human events in raising from this woman of the detested race of Moab, in the deepest wretchedness of poverty, reduced to glean from a harvested field for daily bread, David and Solomon, kings of unrivalled magnificence and glory; and Jesus the Saviour of Mankind— He finally pointed the moral of his discourse, by exhorting his hearers of both sexes, and of all ages, but especially the young, to emulate those virtues which, exerted in the humblest condition of life under the severest trials with which human nature was ever afflicted, have crowned with unfading glory the name of an obscure Moabitish woman, to be revered through a thousand generations throughout the civilized world— Evening visits from Mrs Miller; her son, and Elizabeth C. Adams, Mr Beale and his daughters and E. Price Greenleaf. "

Preparations for departure on our voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia— Mr Curtis came over from Jamaica Plains to concert arrangements for our voyage.— I despatched a Letter, and a parcel of pamphlets to the Revd Josiah Adams of Parkersburg, Virginia, and a Letter to Mr Thomas Adams junr to apologize for my non-attendance, at the Norfolk County, whig Ladies Pic Nic next Thursday. There was an advertisement in this Morning’s Boston Newspapers requesting that the Passengers by the Steamer Acadia should be on board, by half past 10. to-morrow morning, and that their baggage should be sent on board this evening. but Mr Curtis said Captain Miller had told him he should leave the wharf punctually at noon.— Dijah Bowen came for his papers relating to his claim in the right of Rene Gedeon, to bounty Lands, for enlistment in the Legion of franks at New-Orleans, in February 1814. I thought and told Mr Bowen that I had left his papers on a file at Washington, to be sent round by water to Boston; but after he was gone I found the papers, and a Letter of 30 December 1839. from William Gordon, chief clerk of the Bounty Land-Office to me, adverse to the claim.— I made up a packet of all the papers, and enclosed them to Mr Bowen— DrBowditch and MrBarnard came out from Boston this afternoon and repeated an invitation renewed from last year, and which I had some weeks since received from the Warren street Association, to deliver the introductory Lecture to their course for the approaching Season.— Without positively declining, I referred them to a definitive answer after my return from my proposed excursion.— The Revd. Mr Cornell was here this Evening with youngWood; for whom I made application for a Cadet’s warrant for June 1841. when Zealous B. Tower is to vacate the place of Cadet from the 12th. Congressional District of Massachusetts— The young man is exceedingly anxious to obtain the appointment; and I promised to do all in my power to obtain it for him; giving him fair warning of the crosses, and difficulties and dangers and pernicious temptations of the life that he was aspiring to encounter, and fervently exhorted him if he should persist in his purpose and obtain the appointment, to use all his exertions to make good the place of his predecessor, who for three successive years and ever since his admission has been at the head of his class— My wife was much indisposed all this day and evening— Charles went to Boston, and returned home to dine— Miss Henshaw came out from Boston and is to stay with his wife during his absence— I spent the Evening at his house.

Tuesday  Went into Boston in the Carriage, with my Son, his wife and Son Charles— Stop’d at Dr Frothingham’s— Then Mrs Charles went with me to Chaffin’s shop, and chose for me two black Stocks, according to order. Then at Charles’s Office alone— Found Mr Curtis there— Degrand came in and gave me some Newspapers— Snarl between Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson— Queer correspondence between Daniel Webster and Nicholas Biddle; about National and State Bankruptcy, and the examples of France and England— I had received a note from Lieutenant Sturges of the Revenue Cutter, offering to take me in his barge from India wharf to the Steamer— Degrand promised me to return my thanks to Lieutenant Sturges, and to make my apology for not accepting his offer— Return with Charles to Dr Frothingham’s.— Took leave of him, Mrs Frothingham, their son Thomas, Harriet Welsh and Mrs Charles; and Jeremy Leary took Charles and me in the Carriage to the Winisimet or East-Boston steam ferry boat. There we left Jerry and the Carriage to return home, and went over in a Hack from the Tremont House; and embarked in the British and North-American Royal mail Steam packet Acadia Captain Edward C. Miller, bound to Halifax Nova-Scotia, and Liverpool England— We met there 34 other passengers, all entire strangers to us, except a Son (George) of Coll. Thomas H. Perkins, going to England, and whom his father had accompanied to take leave of him at the ship— Josiah Quincy junr. Benjamin Russell, and W. W. Clapp. Mr Isaac T Smith gave me his card, and repeated an invitation. I had some time since received to deliver a Lecture next November before the New-York Lyceum. I said I had delayed answering the former application from unwillingness to decline and uncertainty whether I could comply with it. I feared this would not be in my power, but I would send a definitive answer after my return from this excursion— Mr Curtis was already on board the boat, and my trunk which Gillet the Stageman had brought in from Quincy; and sent on board— Two minutes before 12 O’Clock the Mail came on board, and the boat immediately cast off from her moorings at the wharf—passed by the Columbus line of battle ship lying in the stream, and glided down the bay with smooth water beneath, a gentle breeze around, and a glowing Sun above, at the rate of 9 1/2 knots an hour.— The wharf at East Boston whence we parted, and the line of wharves on the western side of the stream were crowded with Spectators, cheering with shouts the Steamer as she passed along The Steamers John W. Richmond, and General Lincoln, thronged with passengers escorted her down, the latter to just below Castle Island, the former to point Alderton and the Light at the entrance of the harbour, where they respectively took leave of her with reciprocated huzzas and returned to the City— And now vogue la Galere, East North East for Cape Sable; and before dark we had lost sight of the Boston State house, the blue hills, the Northern shores of Marblehead,—Gloucester and Cape-Ann, the South shore of Cohasset, Scituate and Marshfield; and were floating on the boundless expanse of waters— The day and Evening continued fair—the Sunset not altogether unclouded, but with a clear sky above— At 10 I retired to my berth N. 56. and turned in for the Night.

IV:15 Thursday  I slept little, and from about two in the morning lying in my berth, heard the Pilot on the fore-castle giving his steering orders to the helmsman— Shortly after 3. a gun was fired upon deck which was returned from the shore; and just at 4. the boat was moored to the wharf at Halifax. I rose immediately, and as daylight came on viewed the river and harbour, and the opposite shore, where the small town of Dartmouth in a valley between the slopes of two hills covered with forests of pines forms a picturesque landscape— Halifax itself, like our towns of Haverhill, and New-London, and Georgetown, ranges along in streets ascending like stairs in lines parallel to the course of the river— As the Sun rose, Mr Samuel Cunard and his Son Edward came onboard, and invited us to breakfast with him at 8. In the meantime we landed and took lodgings at the Masonic Hall, kept by a man named Coblentz, said to be the best house of entertainment in the town— We breakfasted at Mr Cunard’s and there saw his four handsome daughters, one of whom two days since was married to a Captain of the 37th. Regiment, named Franklyn.— We here met also for the last time, and took leave of Captain Edward C. Miller, a Lieutenant in the British Navy, and Commander of the Royal Steam packet Acadia.— Half an hour after breakfast, Mr Cunard took us in his chariot, and introduced us to His Excellency Sir Colin Campbell, Lieutenant Governor, of the British Province of Nova-Scotia; who received us politely and invited us to dine with him at 7 this evening— The weather had become stormy, and the rain confined us some hours at the inn, which I was enabled to employ in writing. We met for one moment at the door of the inn Coll. Butler, who had been in 1816 one of the Schoolmates of my Sons at Ealing.— He was now about to embark in the Acadia, as a passenger to Liverpool. I had through the day a number of visitors, inhabitants of the town, and full of kind and courteous hospitality— Among them Mr Archibald, Attorney General and Speaker of the provincial house of Assembly, who was going immediately upon professional business to Cape-Breton; Mr John Fairbanks, son of a refugee from Framingham Massachusetts—Mr James Leander Starr, with whose Lady and her Sister, Miss Throckmorton of New-York, and a little daughter of Mrs Starr. I took a ride of an hour and a half in an open Barouche, in a circle of the country round the town— At 7. Mr Cunard came and took Mr Curtis and me in his Carriage to the Governors to dine. But my Son had been taken, with a severe sick head ache; and could not go with us— The dinner was splendid—served altogether on plate.— The company, eighteen chiefly military officers all in full uniform—Sir Colin wearing the Star of the Bath and the Medallion of Waterloo— Lord Charles Fitzroy appointed Governor of Prince Edward’s Island was there en bourgeois with Lady Mary his wife, another Lady, and a Son and daughter of Sir Colin. Between 9 and 10. a messenger came with advice that the Canadian Mails and Passengers had arrived from Picton, and that the Acadia was unmooring to depart for Liverpool, whereupon Mr Cunard and one of the guests were called out, and Mr Curtis and I took leave of Sir Colin and returned to our Inn.

P.M with the Mails and Passengers from Quebec and Prince Edward’s Island, to go by the Acadia for Liverpool— She was to have departed hence this day to return to Quebec at Noon, and we had proposed to take passage in her.— Lord Charles Fitzroy with his family are here waiting to take passage in the Unicorn, to be landed at Charlottes town on Prince Edward’s Island— But on her passage from Quebec down the river Saint Lawrence she took ground and was detained twelve hours— Her Mails, and passengers were landed at Picton, and came thence by land 102 1/2 miles— They arrived at 9 last Evening and at 1/2 past 11. the Acadia departed for Liverpool— The Unicorn arrived at 8. this morning, and we were flattering ourselves that we should embark in her at Noon for Quebec. But her Engine took some damage by her grounding in the river, and she is detained here for a survey and repairs at least until next Tuesday; and perhaps longer. She is then to take Lord Fitzroy to his Government of Prince Edward’s Island, but will not proceed to Quebec until after the arrival from Liverpool here of the Britannia, expected on the 15th.— Our expedition to Quebec is therefore blown up, and we are put to our shifts to get home as we may— I had many kind visitors again this day among whom Mr Joseph Howe, and Mr Thomas Forrester, representatives of the County and town of Halifax in the general House of Assembly. Mr Howe invited us to dine with him at 6. O’Clock, and in the mean time they both took us a ride of nine miles to the head of the bay which runs up above Halifax, navigable, all the way up— Before going I called with my Son upon Mr Sampson Salter Blowers—a refugee from Boston—said to have turned shortly since, his hundredth birthday— He was the official prosecutor as the King’s attorney defender at Boston of Captain Preston and the Soldiers indicted for the Massacre of the 5th. of March 1770. of whom my father and Josiah Quincy were with him the Official defenders—the lawyers in that prosecution, on both sides sustaining the party to which they were opposed of Preston and the Soldiers— Mr Blowers came from Boston with the British troops, and never returned.— He is one of the Patriarchs of the Province of Nova-Scotia, and was successively Chief Justice of the Superior Court after being Attorney General, Speaker of the House of Assembly, Councillor, and sometime acting Governor— He is now in retirement, said to be wealthy, enjoying bodily health, but with all the faculties of the mind impaired— He received us courteously, and thanked us for calling upon him. I told him I was the son of John Adams whom he formerly knew, but he made no answer— I introduced my Son to him and he enquired what was his age. I said we had arrived in the Steamer Acadia from Boston; he said that was his native place, and he had always retained his affection for it, and rejoiced in its prosperity— He had said it would prosper, and believed it was now the most prosperous place in North-America; and this place was the next— We dined with Mr Howe— His wife a Mrs Godfrey, Mr Howe’s brother, Mr Forrester and Mr Bell the other member from Halifax in the House of Assembly, were of the company— Mr Howe accompanied us to our lodgings, and gave us a Letter of introduction toHaliburton, author of Sam Slick, residing at Windsor, for which we took seats in the Stage to depart at 6 to-morrow morning.

Saturday  Disappointed in the purpose of embarking in the Unicorn for Quebec, we concluded to return home, by the way of Annapolis and the Province of New-Brunswick.— We took the Stage first for Windsor, and left our lodgings at the Masonic Hall, at 6 this morning with four travelling companions; Mr John Frothingham a native of New-England, and merchant of Montreal in Canada, with his son Frederic a youth of about 17. and a Bostonian namedsettled as a merchant at Mayaguez in the Island of Porto Rico, about 30 years of age, with his wife, travelling for their health.— We came to Windsor 45 Miles from Halifax in three Stages of 17. 15. and 13 miles with the same Carriage and driver twice changing horses— We reached Windsor about 1. P.M. but found no Steamer there nor any expectation of one before next Tuesday—wherefore, we determined to proceed immediately, and came on 13 miles to Gasperaux river and ten miles further to Kentville, which is a part of the township of Horton. We landed just at Sunset having travelled 68 miles, in one Carriage, and with one driver— The first forty miles of the road are nearly one continued forest of what the Germans call needle wood trees—white and pitch pine, cedar, spruce, fir and Larch; with intermixture of white and yellow, birch, beech, maple, and here and there, red and grey Oak— Many of the trees were tall and straight, but none of them large— The soil generally sand or rock, with few settlements on the road— One country seat between Halifax and Windsor, belonging to the Honourable Thomas Nickleson Jeffery the Senior member of the Executive Council, was the only mansion the elegance of which and of the ground around it, indicated opulence— Scarcely one village on the road—but at distances of a quarter or half mile from each other single farm-houses with elderly looking barns, were surrounded with green pastures, indifferent apple-orchards, a stout and strong breed of horned cattle; a few sorry horses, pigs and swine of ordinary size— Turkies and ducks not remarkable—fine looking and numerous flocks of geese, and dunghill fowls in abundance— Very few ragged and no squalid looking persons, and no beggars— The general aspect is of a healthy quiet and contented population. The children especially remarkable for fair complections handsome faces, and rosy cheeks— On approaching Windsor, and part of the way thence to Kentville, the soil is more fertile; the country much more cleared of wood and the farms more productive— The recollection that Halifax leaves upon the mind of the traveller, is of a very moderately prospering, and not enterprizing city. A garrison of three regiments of infantry 8th. 23d. and 37th. with a Corps of Artillery and of Engineers, gives it the appearance of a City besieged, and the accomodations for the army and navy account for its population, much more than any of its adaptations for commercial enterprize which are very small. As we stop’d at Windsor only to change our horses we had no opportunity to deliver our Letter of introduction to judge Haliburton— At Windsor we saw a large ship of 600 tons upon the Stocks— It is one of the Ports upon the bay of Fundy, in Steam boat communication with St. Johns, New Brunswick.

Sunday  The Stages in this Province do not travel on the Sabbath and we were necessarily detained here this day; much to my satisfaction, for I was glad to escape from the overflowing civilities of Halifax, before we could be made conscious that they were burdensome to those who paid them, and as time advances, I long more and more for one day of repose in seven— After breakfast this morning my first enquiry was for a Church where we might attend public worship and were informed of a presbyterian Church two miles and an episcopal church four miles distant both in the town of Cornwallis, and of a methodist church nearer, where there would be service in the afternoon— Sallying out to walk to the presbyterian church we soon met Mr Thomas Hardy a Scotchman and keeper of the public school at Kentville, who walked some way with us, and Mr James D. Harris a judge of the inferior Court and Sessions of the Peace for King’s County who overtook us in his gig, and invited me to take a seat with him, which I did. He took me to the episcopal church, where he and his family attend, and where the Revd. H. L. Owen read the morning service of the Church of England for the 12th. Sunday after trinity and preached a short Sermon from Habakkuk 2.15. “Wo unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness.” (mark the grammatical transposition of persons, to the verbs—) a plain and sensible discourse against drunkenness, in which the obvious arguments against that vice, were illustrated by quotations from Scripture preceptive and exemplary; not excepting Noah, Lot, and David.— The preachers reading and delivery were very monotonous and sluggish— The Congregation was small but of respectable appearance— Judge Harris’s wife and part of his family were there. He has six sons and three daughters.— His father was one of the refugee, or as they prefer to be called loyalist settlers of Nova-Scotia in 1783. immediately after the close of the revolutionary War— Mr Harris came from Connecticut, a child—he is a judge, and a private Banker; but he told me he had never been a member of the assembly, nor offered himself as a candidate; having no relish for public life. Mr Owen is settled in the neighbouring town of Aylesford; but was accidentally at Cornwallis, returning from a visit to Halifax— He gave notice that there would be divine service at this Church this day fortnight. Judge Harris took me home in his gig, with his son William a boy about 8 years old.— My companions stopped at the Presbyterian church. I had scarcely returned to our inn, when a Doctor W. B. Webster called and invited me with Mr Curtis and my son to ride with him in his Carryall to see a dam and sluice in Cornwallis constructed at an expence of 5000 pounds currency to dike out the waters of the river. we accordingly took the ride and then took tea at his fathers house where he resides. The father is a loyalist emigrant from Connecticut, and a tory of the first water as is a younger brother—he himself is of the popular party— We returned about 10. to our inn. "

Our Stage carriage and driver were both changed this morning to our disadvantage, but the substitutes brought us safely in the course of the day from Kentville to Annapolis, 60 miles, over a road the first part of which was heavy with sand, and the last hilly and studded with rocks; but altogether a very good road— We had besides our company from Halifax, an outside passenger taken up on Saturday at Windsor, and Mr John Whidden, Clerk of the House of Assembly, and now a Candidate for election as a member of the house—for there is an election to be held in November, and we are told that it will be generally and warmly contested— The Government and popular parties are strongly marked and ardently opposed to each other— Dr Webster told us last Evening that his father and brother were Government men, but that he was of the popular party— This Dr Webster is what the French call an original, and the English an oddity. Curiosity and mobility seem to be the characteristics of his temper, without depths of observation or brilliancy of imagination— His motive for taking us to see the Cornwallis dam yesterday, with the invitation to tea at his father’s house, must have been pure kindness and hospitality— He has a taste also for natural history, and shewed us a number of birds stuffed and minerals indigenous in this Province; all collected by himself. We left Kentville which is a part of the township of Horton, named from the late Duke of Kent, after his death at half past 6 this morning, with an accession of two outside passengers to our company, and an exchange of a very good carriage for one of doubtful solidity and unpromising appearance; but which brought us however safely to Annapolis with the setting Sun— The first stage was of 17 miles to Crane’s, that being the name of the man who keeps the house—there we had a good breakfast, and the house though standing alone had a neat and comfortable aspect— The sound of a spinning wheel in a room adjoining to that where we breakfasted brought back sixty years or more of reminiscences familiar to my childhood, but which from that time have never been revived— To my Son it was an unwonted and unpleasant sound, but to Mr Curtis it was as to me a pleasing revival of incidents in early life long since passed away.— From this place we proceeded by a stage of 12 miles to Gibbons; another of 17 miles to Bridgetown, a small and neat looking village, but where there was no dinner in preparation for Stage passengers, and we took up with a collation or lunch of bread and cheese and a bottle of nut brown ale— Here we crossed a lofty bridge, necessarily so from the common rise and fall of the river at the place which is of more than thirty feet of the tide from the bay of Fundy— Our last stage of the day was 15 miles to Annapolis, the Old French Settlement of Port Royal, and formerly the chief town in the Province. No trace of France is now seen in it; nor would one imagine it to be a capital of any colony—but it is a good looking village, where we find comfortable lodgings though at two different houses; and the Steamer Maid of the Mist, to depart to-morrow Morning for the City of St. John in the Province of New-Brunswick.

Tuesday  Our ride yesterday was through a country much resembling that which he had traversed on Saturday— The first part over a heavy sand, and the latter part, through pine clad hills, interspersed with fertile vallies and solitary farmhouses around which we seldom failed to see oxen and cows of large size and in good condition— Fine looking sheep— Flocks of Turkies, Geese and dunghill fowls in abundance— Swine, not so numerous; nor of breeds so choice, yet good looking. Altogether the appearance of the Country, much like that of the interior of Massachusetts sixty years ago— This morning before our departure a gentleman called on me at the inn, and announced himself as a Son of my old and valued friend Benjamin Pickman, heretofore of Salem, now residing in Boston— He has been settled here, he told me about eight years in consequence of having married a Lady of this place, or as Mr Curtis conjectures because he inherited some of his Grandfather Pickman’s sentiments and opinions— We met here also last evening a Scottish Gentleman of the name of Smith, with his arm in a sling from some recent accident, with which I sympathised, according to Swift’s But should some neighbour feel a pain, just in the parts where I complain &c— He told us he had crossed the atlantic 13 times; one of which last year in the British Queen. He was visited while we were at supper by a young man, collector at the Port of Digby, a nephew of Sir Colin Campbell; and who came down with us in the Steamer this morning to that place, where he landed as did several other passengers, while others came on board there— Among them was a tall elderly, cheerless looking Indian, and a young stout, handsome, active ship carpenter from the settlement at Clare about twelve miles from Digby, the still existing remnants of the old Acadian neutral French— We anchored for about an hour at Digby 18 miles from Annapolis whence we had departed, between 7. and 8 this morning— The collector of the Port, brought on board, and lent us Thomas C. Haliburton’s History of Nova-Scotia, which he had casually mentioned in conversation with Mr Frothingham— He requested that the books might be left with Captain Hennenbury, in the Steam boat, to be returned to him when she came back. I would have purchased the books, but he had not a copy to spare— I occupied no small portion of the passage across the Bay of Fundy, in turning over the pages of the first Volume of this Book— The passage between Annapolis and Digby is a narrow basin, like a river broken in from the Bay of Fundy, through a passage between two rocky cliffs not half a mile wide or long. The course from this gap over the Bay of Fundy to St. John is directly North 36 miles.— We had left Kentville yesterday morning, with rain and mist and dark smoky clouds hanging over the sides of all the hills, but it cleared away by noon, and we had a clear night at Annapolis, and a bright Sun this morning— We opened upon the Bay of Fundy about 11. A.M. and could barely discern the opposite coast of New-Brunswick like far off mountains turning into clouds. The Steamer maid of the mist is small and slow and growing old; but the day was fair and without fog, though clouding up, and with a freshening breeze till 5 p.m. when we landed at the wharf in the City of St. John. The gradual receding of the Coast of Nova-Scotia, with the corresponding rise and approach of that of New-Brunswick had a pleasing effect upon the spirits but the rapid tides of the Bay produced a swell which with the briskness of the breeze sickened some of our passengers— A family from Boston a man, his wife, and five boys, from 4 to 12 years old, were among them. We took our lodgings at the St John’s Hotel. named La Hain— "

I would have purchased the books, but he had not a copy to spare— I occupied no small portion of the passage across the Bay of Fundy, in turning over the pages of the first Volume of this Book— The passage between Annapolis and Digby is a narrow basin, like a river broken in from the Bay of Fundy, through a passage between two rocky cliffs not half a mile wide or long. The course from this gap over the Bay of Fundy to St. John is directly North 36 miles.— We had left Kentville yesterday morning, with rain and mist and dark smoky clouds hanging over the sides of all the hills, but it cleared away by noon, and we had a clear night at Annapolis, and a bright Sun this morning— We opened upon the Bay of Fundy about 11. A.M. and could barely discern the opposite coast of New-Brunswick like far off mountains turning into clouds. The Steamer maid of the mist is small and slow and growing old; but the day was fair and without fog, though clouding up, and with a freshening breeze till 5 p.m. when we landed at the wharf in the City of St. John. The gradual receding of the Coast of Nova-Scotia, with the corresponding rise and approach of that of New-Brunswick had a pleasing effect upon the spirits but the rapid tides of the Bay produced a swell which with the briskness of the breeze sickened some of our passengers— A family from Boston a man, his wife, and five boys, from 4 to 12 years old, were among them. We took our lodgings at the St John’s Hotel. named La Hain— "

Perley, inhabitants of the City, visited us, and offered their services, to shew us any of its objects of curiosity.— They took us first to the Officers barracks of the 69th. regiment of British infantry which is stationed at this place. They introduced us to Captain Blackburne the Senoir Captain in command The Colonel being upon a tour in the States, and now at Boston; and the Major gone home to England on leave— Captain Blackburne is a modest and very gentlemanly man, of pleasing deportment, and courteous manners, without affectation, studiously but not fawningly civil— He and several Officers with him shewed us the barracks of the soldiers; their mode of living, their muskets, which he said were not equal to ours, and the curious furniture of their knapsacks, a list of the articles composing which I was tempted to ask, to compare with ours, but refrained— We saw the apartments in which the Soldiers lodge, six, eight or ten in a room, the apartment where they mess—the kitchen where their food is cooked, and the meat and vegetables, in preparation for their dinner.— All which was neat, cleanly, economical, and comfortable— Also the hospital where in two chambers were the sick men in their beds; one of the chambers containing only the cases of ophthalmia which Captain Blackburne told us was a disease more common among the troops than all others put together. He took us also to the room where the musical band were practicing under the direction of the band master; and they regaled us with several beautiful marches and airs conducting with Kate Kearney— From the Barracks we went to the reading room where our names were entered—to the building now in process of erection for a City Hall and Exchange, and to the foundations laid for a large Custom-house— Mr Whipple then took Mr Curtis and me, [(]while Charles staid behind to write a letter home) to a saw-mill on the river two miles above the City, where we saw the operations of sawing logs in to boards and blocks into shingles— On our return to the Hotel, we were visited by multitudes of the Citizens of the place, among whom the Recorder, who in the absence of the Mayor welcomed me to the City, with an offer of a public dinner which I declined, as we are to depart to morrow Morning.— We dined with Captain Blackburne, and the Officers of the 69th. regiment at their barracks about 20 in number, among whom the names of Dalgetty and Kearney, and a Lieutenant Lord Glamis, son of the Earl of Strathmore were the only ones that I remember— Mr Whipple was the only stranger except ourselves.— They toasted the Queen and the President of the United States— Captain Blackburne complimented me, for which I returned thanks and gave the 69th. Regiment, and then the Duke of Wellington— We came home before 11. "

Friday  Early this morning we had a visit from Mr Black, Mayor of St John who expressed his regret that he had been accidentally here, absent from the city, while we were there; and where he would have been happy to have shewn us any attentions, which could make our visit to the place agreeable. He embarked to return home this morning— We had visits also last Evening, and this morning from six or seven Indians two of whom named John Francis—and Neptune—were of our Passamaquoddy tribe, and the rest of the St. John’s or Micmac tribe within this province. They had all been to a general gathering of Indian tribes held in Canada, last month at the invitation of the British Canadian Government for the preservation of Peace. John Francis is the Governor of the Passamaquoddy Indians, and Neptune, who speaks a little English acted as interpreter. They wanted a certificate or paper in the nature of a Passport from me, and said last Night that they were to have one this morning from Sir John Harvey— I asked Neptune if they had got their certificate from Sir John this morning— He said he was too busy.— I told him that I had been, but was no longer a Chief in my own Country, and that a certificate or passport from me, would be of no sort of use to them— The paper of advice from the Canadian Indians which they shewed to me, was an earnest exhortation to them, to adhere inflexibly to the roman Catholic religion, and not to sell one inch of their Lands— On another paper, there was a statement of the motive of their Journey, and a contribution of £5. annexed to the name of Sir John Harvey, upon their journey to Canada in July; from which they are now returning.— The parade of the 36th regiment was to have been at 10. this morning; but there was rain and a lowering sky and there was no parade. At 11. we went in a Carriage to the Government house, where we were received, with great cordiality by Sir John Harvey— He invited us to take a ride with him to view the country round and to name the hour— I named 2. p.m. he said he should then be at leisure, and had sent for Signor Blitz to come and exhibit before his family— We returned to the Hotel, and called at the House of Major Cairnes to return his visit— Not at home— A Committee of 3. Gentlemen came and invited us to visit the reading room which we did at 5 O’Clock p.m. Sir John Harvey’s open waggon had called and taken us to the Government House at 2.— Signor Blitz there performed some of his wondrous works, before the family— Captain Tryon’s little daughter, 3 years old, on Lady Harvey’s lap, and calling the Governor papa mine— Servants called in to see the show. Sir John then shewed us round his grounds; laid out with taste and elegance along the banks of the river— Kitchen Garden well cultivated— He then rode with us about 3 miles up and 2 miles down, on the banks of the river, and landed us at our lodgings at 4. We went with Mr Street the Solicitor General to the Province house; the Legislative and Judicial Mansion— Undergoing repairs— Portraits of George the 3d. Queen Charlotte, and Lord Glenelg— At 5. we visited the reading-room—Newspapers—Featherstonhaugh and Mudge’s Report and Maps. Dined with Sir John Harvey at 7. Captain and Mrs Tryon— Lieutenant Harvey. Mr and Mrs Shore— Major and Mrs Cairnes. Evening party and Ball— Numerous Ladies— Many Officers— Captains Ross and Hogshaw— Beverley Robertson and brothers— Dancing— Waltzing. Home to our lodgings at Midnight. "

But the river flows through all this scenery; with strings of narrow long islands, most of which are cultivated and present an aspect of fertility. 42 miles from Fredericton, we dined at the house of a Scotchman name Munro.— We got a tolerably good dinner to which our driver sat down with us.— We had witnessed no such usage in Nova-Scotia. The carriage had broken down two or three times, and at Munro’s, was detained nearly two hours for a blacksmith’s repairs— Mr Munro with much complaisance told me that he had heard me spoken of very respectfully, in the ould country— We had at one stage after dinner, a third pair of horses tackled to the Stage.— The accidents we met with, were fortunately without hurt to our persons, but delayed our progress till after dark— But the weather which had been rainy and gloomy cleared off towards Night, leaving bright moonshine— We crossed without difficulty at 8 the second ferry five miles from Woodstock; and the creek there, to Mrs Grover’s house at 9. She is a widow, born at Halifax, and says she kept the Masonic Hall at that place, till five years ago, when he died—after which she came here with her mother, who is yet living.

Mr Baire the Frenchman from Madawaska, went off this morning in the stage for that place— An open waggon with 3. Seats, for 6 persons including the driver— There were 8 persons in it, and an enormous load of baggage, which Mr Baire called le butin, before they left the tavern door; and they were to take up two passengers more. Mr Baire had been silent all day yesterday in the Stage, of which I had not known the cause— On finding that he was French, I spoke to him in that language, and found him very willing to converse and apparently glad to talk; but I had so little time for discourse with him that I learnt very little about the Madawaska settlement— On enquiring for an opportunity to attend public worship we found there were in the neighbourhood of our Inn two Churches—one Episcopal Church of England—the other, Wesleyan Methodist; but that the ministers of both were absent, and that there would be no divine service at either. Afterwards however, Mr English, brother in Law to Mrs Grover, and the Postmaster of the place, came and accompanied us to the Methodist Church, where a young man, a native of the Province (vulgarly called a blue nose) named George Williams, performed the services of prayer, and giving out by semi-couplets the hymns to be sung, and read a Sermon of John Wesley from Luke 12.7. “Even the hairs of your head are numbered.” A sensible and not enthusiastic discourse upon a general, and particular Providence— Mr Williams repeated the prayers with fluency, but is a very indifferent reader.— The Revd. Mr Johnson was the regular preacher, and Mr Williams announced that he would preach the next Sunday— The Church is small, but very neat—the congregation not numerous, but well dressed, of grave and decent demeanour, and highly respectable in appearance— We dined at Woodstock. Mrs Grover our hostess, and her family, a son and daughter dined with us— The weather being fair, and an open waggon the only Stage carriage to Houlton, we concluded to take the ride this afternoon, to escape the chance of rain to-morrow Morning— We started at 3 p.m in a Carryall with 3 seats for 6 persons, a pair of horses and a yankee driver. We had 12 miles of good road; through a wilderness of spruce, pine, birch and fir woods to Houlton where we arrived at 5. O’Clock— The dividing line between the Province of New-Brunswick and the State of Maine is about 2 miles short of Houlton, and just before we reached it, a solitary, long, narrow, and apparently empty house, separated by three partitions, our driver told us was a smuggling shop—on the American side; near the line were two Cash stores.— We saw the boundary line, and the summits of Mars Hill, at the distance of 30. Miles— About an hour after us, arrived at the same Inn Major Graham one of the U.S. Commissioners to survey the boundary line; with Lieutt. T. J. Lee and a surveying party— Coll. Pierce and Major Kirby of the Regiment stationed here, called upon us this Evening. Dr Lawson, and five other Officers, are boarders in the House. I met in front of the house, Mr Houlton, after whom the place was named, and had some conversation with him— Maine election to-morrow— Clear Sunset. "

Many of the trees appeared to have been burnt off. The living trees were lofty, with stems of no unreasonable size, but perfectly straight, from 30 to 50 feet high, and suitable for masts of different sizes— Scarcely any ground cleared, and scarcely an attempt to eradicating the stumps. In some places there was grain, rye or Indian corn or grass on the soil, where the stumps were still standing— We came part of the way, along near the Bank of the Penobscot river, on which Bangor is situated— Yesterday was the election day—throughout the State of Maine, and at every stage at which we stopp’d, and every Post-Office by which we passed we witnessed great excitement of anxious curiosity to learn how the vote of yesterday had gone in the towns through which we passed.— At one town, Lincoln, the Postmaster was in fine Spirits, and said they were looking up; because the democrats had gained 4 votes upon the election in 1838—that of 1839. not having been seriously contested—but in all the other towns the gain had been on the whig side—much to the annoyance of our driver and of most of the Postmasters— About 20 Miles short of Bangor, we took up as passengers a man named Haines, and a young man, a son of Professor Cleveland who said he had come 150 miles, for the single purpose of depositing his vote, and we shall elect Fairfield, said he, by 5000 majority—ten minutes after he said—if we do not carry Fairfield by more than 2000 majority I will go for Harrison in November— Shortly after he asked my Son, if he was acquainted with John Quincy Adams—upon which Charles pointed to me, and said that’s he—upon which he offered me his hand which I readily took. At the Bangor house they shewed me into the Ladies parlour, where there were two ladies and a gentleman— In a few minutes the room filled up with visitors, all strangers among whom were Mr Carr the Mayor of the City—Edward Kent, Ex-Governor and now a candidate for election to that Office; and George Barrell Moody, both Classmates at Cambridge of my dear departed son George—Dr Benjamin Dixon Bartlett, a graduate of 1810—Mr Jerome, formerly of Boston and others almost numberless— Mr Carr the Mayor invited me to receive the visits and greetings of the Citizens generally, to which I assented appointing the hour of 10. O’Clock to-morrow Morning, but I said I must ask them to excuse me from addressing them in a speech. "

O’Clock, the Mayor, Mr Carr came, and proposed to me to receive the Citizens who wished to see, and shake hands with me, in a large upper dancing hall in the Hotel to which I assented— There for about half an hour, I received and shook hands with all that came—two or three hundred— They were named as they came, but were all strangers, not one of whose names I can recollect— Many others came merely to look on, and to hear.— They soon filled the hall, and I saw it was impossible to dismiss them without an Address— I told the Mayor that although I had requested to be excused from addressing the Citizens to day; yet as they were now assembled, I could not possibly part from them after this meeting without saying a few words; whereupon, a gentleman named M’Gaw, I suppose some City Officer, in a style far more complimentary than agreeable to me; and I mounted on a Sopha at one end of the Hall, and spoke for about an hour and a half to the People— I gave them my reasons for the request I had made to the Mayor to be excused from addressing them in public— My position as an Ex-president of the U.S. and as possibly a Candidate for re-election as a member of Congress— Reasons for which I had declined attending any of the large public meetings which have been held within the year, from that of Baltimore last May, to that of Bunker hill last week— I should continue to decline attending all such meetings in future, and should now confine myself to two topics specially interesting to the People of the State of Maine, and to myself— I then rectified certain misrepresentations of my opinions made by Joshua A. Lowell, a member of the present delegation from Maine in Congress, and spoke with disgust of Featherstonhaugh’s recent report on the North-eastern boundary— The crowd still collected in the Hall, and the Mayor proposed to me to adjourn to the steps of the House for fear of breaking down the Hall— I preferred closing my discourse, which I did with an abundance of cheering. Then at 12. O’Clock Mr Pierce accompanied me to visit Mr Philip Coombs; a heavy lame invalid old gentleman, whom more than fifty years ago I had known as a tall, slender, active, sprightly young man, living at his father’s house at Newburyport. Mrs Coombs is a relation of the Harrod family. At 1/2 past 1. we dined, and here met Ezekiel Whitman, heretofore a member of Congress from the State of Maine and now a judge—and here we parted from our fellow traveller Lieutenant Wayne—from 4 to 5 I rode to the heights above the City with Mr Carr the Mayor and several others— The view of the city, and the prospects around it from these heights are extremely beautiful— At 5 we visited at Mrs Hammett’s. Mrs Hammett is a niece of Mrs. Cushing the wife of Judge William Cushing once of Scituate. Mrs Cushing was an intimate friend of my mother, and Mrs Hammett has the whole collection of my mother’s Letters to her— Here I met Mr Hedge the Minister— Tea party at Mr Pierce’s, and from 1/2 past 7 to 10. I received visits from the Ladies, at the Hotel. Mr and Mrs Jerome—Major Freeman from Boston. Mrs Fearon requested two autograph signatures. Note and Books from E. F. Duren— Packed up— Bed past 1. A.M— "

                "text": "17. IV. Thursday.  Up again at four O’Clock this morning. At 5 we embarked in the Steamer Bangor Captain Howes for Portland, and Boston— That was the hour at which she should have departed from the wharf: but although the Night had been clear, and the Sun rose bright, with the Sun there came up a thick fog and there was a bar of a few miles below the City, to pass which it was expedient to wait for the flood tide. It was near 7. when we loosened from the wharf with a multitude of passengers—Men—women and children, among whom as sedom fails in a Steamer one, excessively fractious and troublesome baby— Judge Whitman, U.S. District judge Ashur Ware, and judge William Pitt Preble were also of the company— They all live at Portland and have been a fortnight at Bangor upon an arbitration— Mr Fessenden, an elderly member of the bar at Portland, father of the young man just elected to the 27th Congress in the place of Albert Smith was also of the party, and Mr Dwinell a Gentleman to whom we were indebted for many civilities yesterday, but of whom I know nothing further— It is indeed impossible to conceive of the confusion of the mind, and forgetfulness of names upon the presentation of hundreds of persons at one time— In descending the Penobscot river, we passed first by Frankfort on the right and Bucksport on the left bank of the river— I had yesterday several visitors from Brewer; on the opposite side of the river to Bangor.— Frankfort is about 7 and Bucksport 9 miles below— As we approached Frankfort, guns were fired from the shore, and bells were rung—a crowd of people were assembled on the wharf, who as we parted from it gave three cheers— I supposed it a rejoicing of the whigs at their election victory— As we approached Bucksport, the firing of guns and ringing of bells were repeated— Judge Whitman said to me, that is for you— I said surely not—but for the whig victory— As we parted from the wharf the cheering was a hearty shout— The right of petition—the right of petition—huzza for the man who sustains the right of petition—left no doubt of the meaning of the guns and bells— It was a happy moment leaving me to lament to how little purpose I had defended the right of petition.— We afterwards passed by Waldo, and Prospect, Belfast and Castine on opposite sides at the mouth of Penobscot river and opening to the Bay.— Then Lincolnville and Thomaston—through the whole day, sudden and entire alternations of clear, bright Sunshine, and of impenetrable and perplexing fogs disclosed and concealed some of the most beautiful scenery upon earth— For several hours from 9. A.M. till noon there was nothing beyon the vessel to be seen, and I retired to a birth in the lower cabin and ruminated but did not sleep— We afterwards passed the Fox-islands, numerous ledges of rocks— Seguin island light—Pemmaquid point, and just at Sunset went in to Boothbay harbour and anchored at Townsend. Captain Howes was afraid to proceed in the Night, with a fog he said as dense as he had ever seen— Within half an hour after Sunset however the fog cleared away, and the anchor was soon weighed at 8. p.m. we passed by the mouths of the Sheepscut and Kennebeck rivers and Cape Smallpoint— I had a long conversation upon political topics with Mr Fessenden; and then retired without undressing to a couch in the lower cabin, where I slept till awaked by the fastening of the Steamer to the wharf at Portland, precisely at One, in the Morning.

Parris a member of the present Congress from Maine, but who has just failed as a candidate for re-election— We had barely breakfasted, when Mr C. A. Daveis, called upon me, and proposed to me to walk with him to the hill, upon which my father held his last interview with Jonathan Sewall in 1774 immediately before the commencement of the revolutionary War—as related by my father in the preface to the republication of the essays of Novanglus and Massachusettensis— I went accordingly with him upon the hill, which presents one of the most beautiful prospects, that I ever beheld an extensive view of islands; mountains, vallies, and the distant ocean with that own poor house, bosom’d high in tufted trees— Mr Daveis pointed out to me the spot where he supposed the interview between my father and Jonathan Sewall had been held— The place is now a grave-yard, and a deeply affecting spot for the monuments which it contains over the graves of Lieutenant Commandant Willian Burrows commander of the United State Brig Enterprize, and Samuel Blythe commander of the British Brig Boxer, captured by the Enterprize on the 5th. of September 1813. and brought into Portland— The Commanders of both vessels were killed in the action, and here they sleep in death, and in glory side by side, as if they had been man and wife— Mr Daveis said that he felt some mortification in stating that the monument over the remains of Lieutenant Burrows was erected at the expense, not of the citizens of Portland, collective or individual, but of Matthew L. Davis of New-York. Another Monument, which awakened long slumbering sensibilities in my breast was that of Commodore Preble, one of our gallant naval commanders, whose name carries with it round the world the honour of our Country— On returning with Mr Daveis to the Hotel, we met in the Street the Mayor of the City, Mr Ilsley, in former times Collector of the Customs and GenlWingate heretofore a Member of the House of Representatives, U.S. and whose wife is a daughter of the late General Henry Dearborn— With them there was a throng of Citizens of the place whom the Mayor stated to be desirous of paying their respects to me and of shaking hands with me, which they did for about half an hour in a hall of the Hotel. We then went to a new yet unfinished Courthouse and Exchange building, with a dome on the top of it, which we ascended and there again beheld the fair city at our feet, and the exquisitely beautiful prospects of hills, around and the more distant view of the Ocean— Met judge Ware, in his chamber adjoining the Court room and Mrs Ware was with him. The throng continued to shake hands, and I gave them a short parting address of half an hour in the Court room— At 12. Met General Wingate, Mrs Wingate and numerous Ladies at his house— Mrs Bailey (Charlotte Welsh) Short parting address— Dined at the Hotel— Stage to Portsmouth at 1:30. Rockingham house at 8. "

Wingate had expressly invited me to his house at 12 O’Clock to meet the Ladies, who wished to see me— There were many there; but none with whom I had any previous acquaintance, except Mrs Wingate and Mrs Bailey— Many fine women, but whose very names escape me— My parting address to them was extremely Laconic—on our way back to the Hotel, we met three young Ladies who were going to Genl. Wingate’s, and whom Mr Daveis introduced to me in the Street— At his request we stop’d at one house, where he introduced to me two others— On our return to the Hotel, I received a polite note from Mr Albert Smith inviting me to dine with him at his boarding house— And while we were at dinner at the Hotel he came in, and I thanked him for his kindness and apologized for being deprived of the pleasure of accepting his invitation to dinner by our immediate departure for Portsmouth— In the Stage from Portland we had a very handsome young woman from Newburyport married at Portland, who was going to Newburyport; with a young man, perhaps her brother.

                "text": "20. V:20. Sunday.  Clear morning— I went to the corner of Charles’s house, and saw the Sun—just risen 5:44. Heard the Revd. John Langdon Sibley, this morning, from 1. Corinthians 1.12. “Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul: and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas, and I of Christ. 13. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?” This was a discourse on the diversities of Sentiment and opinions among men, as resulting from the constitution of human nature; and upon the duty of mutual toleration and liberality resulting therefrom— Mr Sibley’s remarks were sensible and judicious, manifesting a Christian temper and benevolent disposition; but not much depth—of observation or of research.— His delivery is good, but not remarkable— Much superior to any thing that I have heard the last two Sundays, since I left home. Mr Sibley was a Classmate of my son Charles at Cambridge— He dined with us— He expressed great curiosity to have mount Wollaston, and the place where John Hancock was born pointed out to him; which I did—walking over the hill to Meeting, after dinner— I had shewed him also at his request, my Library—the Volumes of my diary, and some of my Letter-books and my father’s . The original Letter to Nathan Webb of October 1755. and the Book copy of the Letter to my mother of 3. July 1776.—I gave him also copies of my three Eulogies, of the Oration of 4. July 1837 at Newbury-port—the Speech on the right of Petition in June 1838. The Jubilee of the Constitution, at New-York April 1839. and the Speech of May 1840. on the English system of smuggling.— Mr Sibley’s afternoon text was from 2. Corinthians—6:14—[“]for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness.”— I had not time in the leisure of this day, even to read through all the Letters which have been received here for me, during my absence; among which are invitations of 1. September from the Whigs of Michigan to attend and take part in a whig convention at Detroit on the 30th of September, from the whigs of North-Carolina to attend their Convention at Raleigh, on the 5th. of October, and from the whigs of the Western part of New-York to attend and address a Convention at Buffalo on the 7th. of October— Letters also from E. J. Lee of Alexandria, from Philip R. Fendall and from a Committee of the Proprietors of the second Presbyterian church at Washington, upon various political topics and religious concerns which will require my particular notice, and early attention— Mary-Louisa, my Granddaughter read to me in the French Bible, the third chapter of the Book of Judges, to which she had read before I went away.— Charles and his wife, the Midshipman John Quincy and Elizabeth C. Adams spent the Evening here— I have been several Nights in my sleepless hours brooding over a project of verses upon the memory of childhood. "

My son went to Boston this morning, and returned home to dine— His wife, and Mary, went also to Boston, and took Elizabeth De Windt with them— She had received a Letter from her mother, who had left her here last Friday, and gone herself into Boston to Mrs Keating’s, and now directed Elizabeth to come to her— I went up the hill to Charles’s house it being the equinoctial day, but the Sun rose beclouded—and I could not note the time or place— With the exception of a short visit to my garden, nursery, orchard and seminary, the day was occupied with this diary, in which I have a new arrear of eight days to redeem— About Sunset, I walked to Mrs T. B. Adams’s, and found her recovered from a recent indisposition— Her Sister Mrs Foster is to leave her to-morrow, going on a visit to Bangor— The Midshipman John Quincy walked home with me, with the illumination of a splendid Aurora Borealis— With this sets in the sharp autumnal cold, which kindled a fire in our dining room; and I found one at Mrs T. B. Adams’s— At home I found Mr Price Greenleaf as a visitor, and my Son had a proof print of the portrait of my mother to be published with the volume of her Letters which he has prepared for publication, and which he expected would have been published before our departure for Nova-Scotia. The print is a copper plate engraving, from the Portrait in water Colours taken about 1764 or 1765 shortly after my mothers marriage—during her absence in England, about 1785. this portrait with that of my father taken at the same time were removed from the house at the foot of Penn’s hill, by my aunt Cranch to her house, where they remained upwards of 50 years, till about the this time last year, when I took my father’s portrait to lend to Mr Bancroft at Boston, to be engraved for a forth coming volume of his history of the United States— Since then, Charles has undertaken to publish this small volume of my mother’s Letters, and had this portrait engraved, to front the title-page. But it is wretchedly executed, and he doubts whether to accept and use it, or to publish the book without any portrait. I thought, bad as it is, that it is better than none—and better than to delay the publication till another plate can be engraved— The inconvenience of this would be increased by the fact, that there is already a favourable review of the Book in the North-American Review for the present quarter, which will be published the first of next Month— And so think the Ladies of the family.  And now that I shall at least for some time have no memorable daily facts to record, I ought from day to day to make up a summary of reflections resulting from my observations in a three weeks excursion to the British Provinces of Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and through the State of Maine, and a corner of New-Hampshire— For, to what purpose is travel, but to replenish the mind with observation? and to what purpose is a mind full of observation, but to impart?— Oh! for the mind of a Humboldt!— How poor and barren is mine!

Birth day of my Son Charles’s eldest Son, John Quincy who is seven years old— Cloudy morning, so that I could not observe the rising of the Sun— Miss Abigail Quincy with Miss Phelps and Mr Josiah Quincy junr two younger children Samuel and Mary paid a morning visit to our Ladies— My wife and Mrs John Adams, went this afternoon over to Weymouth— I planted the stone of a very large peach, with two Nova-Scotia plum-stones 6. Shagbark walnuts in the drupe, and 6 English white-oak acorns in patch 3 row 7 of the seminary, opposite the old plum tree— I had a large young Peach-tree, transplanted into this patch last autumn; which being now dead, I had taken out of the ground, and these Stones, nuts and acorns put down in its place— There is a black currant-bush, and an Apple-seedling growing in the Georgiana patch, where the violet blossomed through the whole of last Summer, and is not yet extirpated. I cannot approach the place but with sweet and bitter tears— I paid a visit to Mr Thomas Greenleaf of the early part of this Evening— Charles and his wife were here the latter part of it— We had fire in the dining room, and I had need of some self-controul to abstain from having one made in my Library where I was writing to retrieve these arrears— In our recent excursion the observation frequently recurred to me of the results upon the physical, political and moral face of the country, under the colonial, and the independent condition, compared with each other— The aspect of the Provinces of Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick constantly reminded me of that of Massachusetts-Bay, in the days of my childhood, as far back as I can remember. The Provinces are prosperous—their population increases from year to year— The British Government, taught by woful experience the absurdity of expecting to raise revenue from these Colonies, passed to the other extreme, and pours forth from her own funds, with a lavish hand— They maintain their authority over the Provinces at enormous sacrifices of men and money. The Salaries of the Lieutenant Governors of Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, fall little short of that of the President of the United States. An army of 16000 men, is now maintained in these two Provinces and the Canada’s. The whole army of the United States is now 12500. Nearly doubled as it has been within the last 3 years— There are three regiments, the 8th. 23d. and 37th. stationed at Halifax besides divisions of Royal Artillery and Engineers— Twenty-three regiments of Nova-Scotia-Militia, all armed, officered and trained—a Navy of 26 armed vessels and 6 armed Steamers—all together presenting the aspect of a community clad in complete steel and prepared for defence against the most formidable assaults— There is a regiment the 69th. at St. John, and a Regiment the 36th. at Fredericton— In the Canadas are many more; and a Governor General, holding a Court, and maintaining an Establishment little less than royall. All this for a population less than one half equal to that of the State of New-York—and all this maintained at the expense of the British Nation— These possessions are cherished as destined to hold in check, and under controul the growing power of the United States of America, an object for which John Bull considers no sacrifice too great.

Morning visit from the Chevalier Hulsemann, Secretary of the Austrian legation; whom we met in the Steamer Bangor to Portland, and on our return to Boston at the Tremont house. I did not then recollect his name, having seen him not more than once or twice at Washington last winter— He told me that he had been out here with Mr Caleb Cushing at the Pic Nic on the 3d. and they had visited our family—but the Ladies had not remembered him any better than I did, and until this day knew not who he was— Mr Beale and his daughter Caroline were here this Evening; and Charles and his wife of course.— I walked this afternoon to Mr John Greenleaf’s, and saw him and his two daughters, Mrs Lucy and Mrs Mary Dawes. He is 78 years of age, of which he has been upwards of 60 years blind, and for some years past hard of hearing, though not absolutely deaf.— Mrs Greenleaf, my Cousin, once Lucy Cranch, is but three months younger than myself. She is now confined to her chamber, by a dropsical disease, from which there is no hopes of her recovery— I called next at the house of Mrs T. B. Adams, but she was gone with her son John Quincy, to visit Mr John Marston at Taunton, and Elizabeth was at Mr Edward Miller’s. My last visit was Dr Woodward who is building a house— There I met two young women daughters of Henry Wood— His wife is a daughter of Deacon Ebenezer Adams, first cousin both by father and mother’s side to my father. I did not know them. There is hardly an old family in this town, with whom I have not some affinity in blood— But to return to the province of Nova-Scotia— Mr Curtis purchased for me at Fredericton, Thomas C. Haliburtons Historical and Statistical account of Nova-Scotia, in two 8vo. Volumes, published in 1829. a very valuable work.— From this it appears that the population of the Provinces in 1790 was about 30000. in 1817. 82053. and in 1827. 123,848—besides 30000 in the Island of Cape Breton: Hence within the last half century the population has more than quadrupled; and has kept a full proportion to the average increase throughout the United States; though in no wise comparable to the increase in our Western States, or New-York or Pennsylvania— Two thirds of this population of Nova-Scotia proper consists of the remnants and descendants of 20000 loyalists or refugees from the North-American States who settled there in 1783 immediately after the close of the American revolutionary War— The numbers of the people now including the Island of Cape-Breton must exceed 200,000— The territory of the Peninsula covers an Area of 15617 square miles nearly double that of the State of Massachusetts; and with a population of 100 to a square mile, which is about that of Massachusetts, would number more than one million and a half of inhabitants— It is not probable that it will ever feed such numbers— Its situation however is favourable to commerce, and its climate to the establishment of manufactures. Of these there are now none, the policy of the mother country being to furnish them for the Province— They are imported duty free, and there is neither capital nor shill in the colony to start or maintain a competition with the manufacturers at home.

The day of the monthly meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society, which I did purpose to attend; but on reflection, I thought it would be a useless waste of time, and concluded to stay at home. Since my excursion of three weeks, I find propensities of dissipation stealing upon me which it is advisable to controul, and to return as far as possible to the duties before me— Returning home last Evening, I met Mr Richards of the Quincy Lyceum who had called at my house, to solicit a Lecture from me for that Institution, which I promised to deliver before my departure for Washington— As yet the arrears of the Diary absorb all my time, excepting a morning hour, which I have devoted on resuming the perusal of Bancroft’s history of the United States— Elizabeth C. Adams dined and spent the evening with us— Charles attended a Meeting of the democratic party this Evening, at which George Bancroft, Collector of the Customs at Boston, Superintendant of Light-houses within the Commonwealth, and Commissioner for building a Custom house at Boston, delivered an electioneering democratic address— This practice of itinerant speech-making has suddenly broken forth in this Country to a fearful extent.— Electioneering for the Presidency, has spread its contagion to the President himself—to his now only competitor; to his immediate Predecessor—to one at least of his Cabinet Counsellors, the Secretary of War—to the Ex-candidates Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster, and to many of the most distinguished members of both Houses of Congress— Immense assemblages of the People are held—of 20, 30, 50,000 souls, where the first Orators of the Nation, address the multitude, not one in ten of whom can hear them, on the most exciting topics of the day— As yet the parties call and hold these meeting separately and seldom interfere with each other— But at the Baltimore convention last May one of the Marshals of the procession, a respectable mechanic of the city was killed, by an attempt of individuals of the opposite party to break it up— At a meeting a few days since on long Island, Mr Webster in a speech of two hours and a half, observed that there was to be held a meeting of the opposite party another great meeting at the same place on the next day; and he gave what was equivalent to a challenge to Silas Wright and all the administration leaders to meet him on the stump.— A hand bill was this day circulated in this town, severely reflecting on Mr Bancroft, for coming to deliver this address— Charles says that at Medford there has already been hostile collision between the parties—and the tendency of all this undoubtedly is, to the corruption of the popular elections, both by violence and fraud— Charles came in after hearing Mr Bancroft’s address, which was delivered at the Universalist Meeting house— Bancroft is an apostate federalist, as are almost to a man the leaders of the mock democracy of this State— Most of them, have cast off their caterpillar skin within the last five years— My father used to say of such "

New-Moon—  Morning visit from Mr Thomas Greenleaf, my neighbour, and Mr Thomas Payson of Peterborough, New Hampshire, Classmates at Harvard University, and graduates of 1784. I have been for a few years past in occasional correspondence with Mr Payson, who at the age of 76 after a life not prosperous in the smiles of Fortune, retains great vivacity and sprightliness. He laughs as heartily as if he were but 25— Mrs De Windt and Harriet Welsh came out from Boston to spend the night here. Charles went to Boston, and returned to dine. He and his wife spent the Evening here— I gave an hour in the seminary, and planted English white oak acorns, and shagbark walnuts, with a peach and a plum stone, in patch 3. row 4. and patch 4 row 5. Walking up the hill to see the Sunset I met Mr Josiah Brigham at my Son’s house.— Settled Mr Curtis’s account of our expenses on our recent tour— Among my remarks during that excursion, was the contrast between the excessive election excitement, which we left behind us at Boston, and found again blazing out, on the very day of our entrance into the State of Maine, and the calm and almost lethargic condition of the British Provinces. The British Government makes itself felt there only by its favours— Levies no taxes; pays nearly all the charges of Government—keeps an army at great cost, and a considerable naval force, for the protection and defence of the Country; and humours the people in every thing— They have also made excellent roads through the forests of Nova-Scotia; and are now doing the same in New-Brunswick— No Government upon earth probably so assiduously labours to make itself acceptable to the people under its rule as these Colonial authorities— There are however representative assemblies in both Provinces, and in each a Legislative and an Executive Council— Their provincial Parliaments were like the House of Commons at home elected for seven years; but that of Nova-Scotia, is already reduced to four, and they are expecting the same alteration in New Brunswick— There is in Nova-Scotia, however, a sharp and sturdy opposition in the house of Assembly, and that body last year passed a vote of censure upon Sir Colin Campbell, the king’s Governor.— The British privy Council, fully approved the measures, censured by the Assembly; but they recalled Sir Colin, and since we were there Lord Falkland has arrived in the Steamer Britannia, at Halifax, and has taken his place— This is a very convenient mode of adjusting dissensions between the Legislative and Executive authorities— An election for a new house of assembly is now about to take and the prospect was of a large majority to sustain the last house, and against the Governor.— Lord Falkland will find no difficulty in disarming this majority; if he walks in the footsteps of Sir John Harvey— His qualification for the office is that his wife is a cousin of Queen Victoria; being a daughter of Mrs Jordan, and of the Sailor king, when duke of Clarence.

Fahrenheit 42  My daily task is the diary of the preceding day, and the redemption of one day of recent arrears— It failed of accomplishment this day, because I wasted my time in idle researches among newspaper advertisements— Mrs De Windt and Harriet Welsh, had intended to return this Morning to Boston, but finally concluded to stay and dine at my Son’s— I dined there with them, and Mr Beale and Mr Lunt— Immediately after dinner, my wife and Mrs John, and Mrs Charles, took Mrs De Windt and Miss Welsh into Boston left them at Mrs. Allyne Otis’s and returned home this evening.— Charles was not here— Mrs De Windt had with her the first copy of the volume of my mother’s Letters. It deserves notice how very little intercourse there has heretofore been between the People of the United States and those of the adjoining British Provinces, and most especially with Nova-Scotia— Yet they well deserve to be studied by a young American Statesman; for they are destined to have hereafter a very powerful influence over the condition of the North American Union and especially over its Northern and Western Sections. The Policy of the British Government has been to excite and main divisions of interest among the colonies themselves as well as to nourish and stimulate their animosities against the neighbouring States. In 1784. the Province of New-Brunswick was set off from Nova-Scotia, and constituted a separate colony— So was the island of Cape-Breton, which has however been since re-annexed to Nova-Scotia. There are very perceptible mutual rivalries and jealousies between the Provinces and, a great indifference in both to the Canada’s.— They levy an impost duty of five percent upon all imported goods from one to the other, and it is very apparently part of the political system at home to keep them as much as possible alienated from each other; that all my be more perfectly dependent upon the common parent— Another precaution at home is a rigorous prohibition to recruit any of the regiments in the provinces— Of the ten companies constituting a regiment they always retain four in England in depot; and send them out from time to time, to supply the vacancies by death or desertion. The last are very rare— The men are enlisted for life, and as they are all taken from the paupers of the three kingdoms, and are fed, clad and lodged at the king’s expense, and trained exclusively to the performance of military service, they are nested in a condition of existence from which they have little temptation to depart, especially at the risk of capture and severe punishment— Yet on the day that we were at Saint John, a Court martial was held upon a Soldier who had deserted from the 69th. regiment, and who one of the Officers said had been taken at Portland— I mentioned this at Portland, to their great surprize— "

Sun rose beclouded— Fahrenheit 60—  Mr Motte is the Pastor of a small congregational Church in Boston.— He is a native of South-Carolina, and was a Classmate, and two years chum of my dear Son George at Harvard University— He was educated and ministered sometime in South-Carolina, as an episcopal clergyman, but upon consciencious conviction became a convert to the unitarian doctrine, and was for sometime settled as Minister of the Unitarian church, at Washington— For the last ten years he has been Minister of the South Congregation, Washington Street Boston— He preached this day at our Church, by exchange with Mr Lunt— His morning text was from James 5:11. [“]Behold we count them happy, which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.” and he read part of the first, and of the last chapters of Job— Patience under affliction was the exhortation of his discourse, and I thought he had selected this Sermon for delivery here, with reference to my misfortunes, and to his former relations with my beloved Son— I felt grateful to him for his intention— He dined with us. But the conversation which seemed most agreeable to him, was upon European politics. His afternoon text was John 20.31. [“]But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.”— Upon the evidences of Christianity. My attention and thoughts were too much absorbed by the volume of my Mothers Letters which my Son has published, and of which he sent me this morning a copy— An admirable Memoir of her life, written by him is prefixed to the Letters, and the reading of it affected me till the tears streamed down my face— It disabled me for all other occupation, and the arrears of this diary, and the Sermon of Barrow were forgotten Charles was here this Evening; but his wife was detained at home by the rain which fell copiously. I had heard Mary Louisa read two chapters of the Book of Judges in Saci’s french Bible, and had read the 6th. chapter of the first Volume of Bancroft’s History of the United States— This chapter is entitled restrictions on Colonial Commerce— It is a very lame account of the English Navigation Act, and a florid panegyric upon the first settlers of Virginia; upon the soil, and climate of that Country—upon the Indian Monarchs, Powhatan and Opechancanough in equal measure. Bancroft is that combination of sycophant and slanderer, which formed Shakespears Iago— The “flatteur dehonté, et calomniateur au besoin” of Mirabeau. With all this he has transcendent talents and indefatigable industry— Every page of his history teems with evidences of profound research, quick perception and brilliant imagination— It is extremely entertaining— The style diffuse and declamatory; far less chaste, though more fascinating than that of Irving or of Prescott. The morality ostentatious, but very defective. "

Smith, who came to me on the first of this Month on board of the Steamer Acadia, with a repeated application to me to deliver a Lecture next November before the New-York Lyceum— I answered again indecisively but discouragingly and promised an answer definitive at an early day. In the afternoon I had a visit from Mr James L. Curry late President of the Boston Mechanic Apprentices library Association, with his Successor the present President of the same Society, requesting me to deliver the introductory Lecture, about the first of November to their Winters course— Mr Webster had encouraged them to expect that he would perform this service for them— But he is now itinerant as a political orator, and has informed them that his engagements will not admit of his being here in time to discourse as he had promised them. These perpetual, and almost numberless applications are to me very distressing: between the wish and the inability to comply with the request of a favour, itself importing kindness and respect— I have however declined, upon the chance that I may be called to Washington, before the close of the next Month— Mr Curry has ceased to be President of the Mechanic Apprentice’s library Association, because his apprenticeship has terminated. Mr Haley was the Secretary when I prepared the two Lectures for them, and delivered one of them last November— I this day brought up the arrears of diary into which it fell during my recent excursion, but leave many remarks which I ought to have made, never to be recorded.— In the account of the visit that I made to Sampson Salter Blowers, at Halifax I was mistaken in the statement that he had been the prosecutor of Captain Preston, and the Soldiers of the 29th. Regiment, for the Tragedy of the 5th. of March 1770— He was on the contrary one of the Counsel for the accused, with my father and Josiah Quincy. The Prosecutors were Samuel Quincy, and Robert Treat Paine— Blowers however named as one of the Counsel for the Soldiers, appears to have taken no part in the argument— There were five indictments, one for each of the five inhabitants killed in the fray, each charging first the soldier, whose fire killed the individual charged in the Bill as murdered, and then charging Captain Preston and other soldiers of the guard as accomplices in the murder— The first indictment against Wemms charged also four individuals not soldiers as accomplices in the crime; they were however separately tried, not till the next December, and were all acquitted—on the five indictments, Preston, and six of the eight Soldiers were acquitted— Two Matthew Killroy, and Hugh Montgomery, were found not guilty of murder, but guilty of Manslaughter, and were discharged upon the claim of the benefit of clergy and the brand of cold iron upon the hand— There is more curious matter in this trial which would make a good Lecture— Midshipman John Quincy was here this Evening.

Bancroft’s history— Speeches, and pamphlets—and above all newspapers; which steal the hours away and leave nothing for memory to record— Having redeemed my last arrears, I expected to have this day several hours of leisure; but could accomplish nothing more, than the record of yesterday, and an answer to John H. Weedon and sundry others, Committee of a whig Tippecanoe association of Pawtucket, Rhode-Island, from whom I have an invitation to appoint some day, to go and address them upon the Presidential Election— I declined— Afternoon visit from Dr Palfrey; and Mr Lothrop, the Minister of the Brattle Street Church and Society. Dr Palfrey’s object was to repeat the solicitation to me to furnish two Articles for the North American Review—of which he is now the Editor and Proprietor— One a biographical account of William Tudor junr. and the other an Article upon the present condition of the Empire and trade of China; and particularly upon the case or prospect of War between Great-Britain, and the celestial Empire— It is impossible for me to prepare an Article upon either of these subjects because I have not, and have never been able to obtain the material facts of the life of Mr Tudor—and because I have no particular information; nothing but loose, disconnected, Newspaper Reports upon the controversy between Great-Britain and China— I received a few days since from Mr John M Forbes, a folio volume of 458 pages, being the Correspondence relating to China, laid before both Houses of the British Parliament, last Spring by command of Queen Victoria— With the aid of this volume together with the information which I might collect from other sources, which it will indicate, I might make out a tolerable Article, but for the want of time. As it is, I shall have more than enough to do, to prepare a Lecture for the Quincy Lyceum, which I have promised, and the subject of which is yet floating in uncertainty upon my mind— In addition to all my other troubles, I took last Saturday, I know not how, a severe cold, and catarrhal cough, which torments me ever since. Visited my garden and nursery this afternoon— Gathered sundry Shagbarks and English white oak Acorns. Two rows of which, 6 of each in each row, I planted—at the left hand of the garden gate next North of the House— I have numerous fruit and forest trees of growth from one to ten years old—but twenty years are necessary to raise an orchard, and thirty years for a forest so that I might leave the accomplishment of that purpose to my Successors— At the dusk of Evening, I walked to Mrs T. B. Adams’s to deliver a Letter to her daughter Elizabeth which I had received this morning— But Mrs Adams, and Elizabeth, and John Quincy were all gone to Medford, and are expected to return to-morrow Evening— Dr Palfrey spoke to me this afternoon of an Article in the National Intelligencer; upon Featherstonhaugh’s report on the North-eastern boundary, with a map, which I have not seen— "

Deacon Spear was here this morning, and I had much conversation with him concerning my property in this town, and the necessary measures for the prudent and economical management of it; a subject exceedingly irksome to me, and for which I become from day to day more and more incompetent— The Mount Wollaston farm, the Penn’s hill farm—the Mansion house farm, the Salt-marsh and the woodlands, the repairs and preservation of buildings, the making and maintenance of fences, and the continual laying out of roads, all require persevering care, and skillful attention, nearly all of which I have committed in trust to my Son, but of which a small portion remains sufficient to be burdensome upon my spirits, and to tax my time— I agreed to go into the woods some day next week with Deacon Spear, and Mr Lemuel Humphreys the Weymouth surveyor in search of a woodlot of which I am part proprietor, but how much, and with whom as tenant in common I know not— I am and for many years have been taxed for the whole; and as the wood upon it is now in condition to be cut off and sold, I propose to exercise that right of possession for the whole, responsible to each of the other proprietors for his part of the proceeds— Lewis Bass was next here, collector of the town and County tax. 288 dollars which I paid by a check on the Quincy Stone bank— Bass and Harvey Field are joint Lessees of my Penn’s hill farm— The lease expires next April and Field and Bass are desirous of having a new lease each for himself of the whole. I told Bass that I should prefer to have him sole tenant for the whole, but referred him for final arrangements to my Son.— He and his wife, and three elder children dined with us, and about an hour before dinner Mrs De Windt came in from Boston with a young Clergyman named Simmons, who has acquired some notoriety by preaching two Sermons at Mobile in the State of Alabama, where he had been two years settled, exhorting his hearers to emancipate their Slaves— This was no longer ago than last May; and the immediate consequence was that he was exhorted to depart from the City and the State, which he did, without delay. Since then he has been some time preaching at Fishkill landing, and became an inmate in the family of Mrs De Wint. They dined with us, and returned this Evening to Boston— After dinner I took him with me into my garden, Nursery and Seminary to view my seedling trees; and then up the hill to the porch of Charles’s house to view the prospect of Boston Bay and City, Mount Wollaston, and the villages of Quincy.— While we were at dinner, Mr Barnard, brother of the one who came on the 31st. of August with Dr Bowditch came for an answer whether I would deliver a Lecture before the Warren Street Association— I promised an answer within ten days.

Thursday  Rain all Night, and almost the whole of this day.— I had a fire at last made in my Library, having kept if off, for the last ten days, perhaps at the expense of a severe catarrh— I had been unable yesterday when I gave a check to Lewis Bass, to find my Quincy stone bank check book, and after a vexatiously fruitless search for it, had conjectured that I might have left it at the Bank, the day before my departure for Halifax— I therefore walked this morning to the Bank and made enquiry for my book but it was not there. I then bethought myself of looking for it, where upon my return home I found it; in the pocket of my trunk. There I had deposited it for special safekeeping; this is one of the now almost daily warnings of the decay of Memory, which is growing upon me, and for which I would in vain seek a remedy. The very excess of caution produces the effect of total heedlessness— My early rising enabled me to effect more this day than usual, though three hours of it were occupied in reading Mr Webster’s Speech to a great meeting of Merchants last Monday, at New-York— One of the most remarkable peculiarities of the present time is, that the principal leaders of the political parties, are travelling about the Country from State to State, and holding forth like methodist preachers, hour after hour to assembled multitudes, under the broad canopy of Heaven. Webster and Clay, W. C. Rives, Silas Wright, and James Buchanan, are among the first and foremost in this canvassing Oratory, while Andrew Jackson, and Martin van Buren with his heads of Departments are harping upon another string of the political Accordion, by writing controversial electioneering Letters— Besides the prime leaders of the parties numerous subaltern officers of the administration, are summoned to the same service, and instead of attending to the duties of their Offices Rave, recite and madden round the land— Mr Bancroft’s lecture last week, though said not to have been acceptable to his own party, because not sufficiently violent has yet given to the whigs of Quincy so much uneasiness that they applied to my Son, to deliver a Counter-lecture to them this Evening, which he did at the same place, where Bancroft spoke, at the Universalist church— I went and heard him. He spoke about an hour and a half between 7. and 9. O’Clock, professedly in refutation of Bancroft’s Lecture— The house was crowded as full as it could hold, and the discourse was received with frequent, and finally with long continued applause— After he finished, Adam Curtis one of the whig committee read a notice that to-morrow evening at the same hour, and in the same place, Mr Abel Cushing of Dorchester, would deliver a Lecture in reply to Mr Adams— Charles rode home with me— His wife was here, but as it was raining and the road was muddy they both went immediately home in the carriage— I began a desperate attempt to write a Lecture upon Faith to be delivered here before the Quincy Lyceum. The subject is a perfect Chaos in my mind, and I dare not indulge the hope of shaping it into a discourse of at least an hour— But I must try. "

                "text": "2. V:30. Friday  Another dull gloomy day, with alternate rain, mist and fog— It confined me to the houses, till the twilight of Evening suspended my writing.— Daniel Hardy of Hanson came while we were at dinner, to enquire concerning the condition of the claim of the widow Eunice Everson to a revolutionary War Pension— I told him it was suspended upon two obstacles—first a deficiency of evidence; and secondly upon an empty Treasury, and a consequent stubborn opposition in Congress at their last Session, to all further extension of revolutionary War Pensions— He said she was very old, and destitute and greatly needed the pension— And that her friends had collected all the testimony, believed to be now attainable to support her claim— That Mr John Smith of Hanson, who had heretofore corresponded with me on the subject, had requested him to call on me, and make these enquiries, and to ask my opinion of the prospect of obtaining the pension at the next Session of Congress— I told him that if Mrs Everson’s friends would transmit to me the testimony which they have collected, I would present the claim again at the Commencement of the next Session of Congress, and do whatever might be in my power to obtain a decision in its favour— But that with regard to my opinion I could give little encouragement to hope for its success, at the next Session—the short Session, with a worse than empty treasury, and either a prospect of immediate change of the responsible agents of public affairs, or a confirmed fixture of those in power, releasing them from the obligation of all pledges or bonds for good behaviour; and from all tender concern for the claims of revolutionary worthies or their families. their chance with the next Congress, might be more propitious— At dusk I walked to Mrs T. B. Adams’s, and found her at home with Elizabeth and the Midshipman, John Quincy to whom I gave a Letter from his brother Isaac Hull.— Miss Mary Harrod was also there—yesterday from Portland— I walked home in darkness and through the mire, without stopping to hear Abel Cushing’s reply to Mr Adams, at the Universalist Church. Charles went to Boston and returned home to dinner. He brought me Lord Brougham’s translation of the Oration of Demosthenes for the crown— Miss Hannah Adams’s Memoir of her own Life, published by Mrs H. F. Lee; a gift from Mrs Hannah Bigelow—with a note from Harriet Welsh and an extract from a manuscript Memoir of MrsHay, by her niece Mrs Lee—and lastly, from Dr Palfrey, a copy of his funeral Discourse on the late President Kirkland— What a scattering of temptations to read; with Bancroft’s history, my mother’s Letters and the daily newspapers already on hand— I could not resist Lord Brougham’s introduction, where with self complacency somewhat ludicrous, and yet not without plausibility he insists that none but a practical orator can be competent to translate the Oration for the crown— He cites the example of Cicero—but Cicero translated into Latin the Oration of Eschines against Ctesiphon, with that of Demosthenes for the crown.— Brougham should have done the same in English— The Oration of Eschines, is indispensable, to appreciate the full power of the answer to it, by Demosthenes.

                "text": "3. IV:30. Saturday.  The third successive day of rain, mist and fog, confining me to the house, but enabling me, to write more of my Lecture upon Faith—a subject upon which I have long meditated, and formed opinions, perhaps worthy of being communicated to the world, but immature in my own mind, and which can never be wrought into consistency, but in the form of a Dissertation— My principal difficulty consists in the dryness and hacknied nature of the subject profoundly metaphysical, and buried in the bottomless depths of religious controversy— Can I take it up without encroaching upon the province of the pulpit? Can I touch it, without getting entangled in the theological snarl, between Salvation by Faith and by Works? Can I trace, and unfold to demonstration the indissoluble union between religious and moral faith? can I show that it is the link of responsibility between man and his maker, and the only bond of Association between man and his brother? that it is the characteristic of his immortal nature? that it is the adamant of all human Society the cohesive principle of the gregarious animal man? Can I define its legitimate powers— Its vitality to the institution of government? to the relations of domestic life? to the peace and justice of independent communities? to the intercourse of trade and commerce? to all the public and all the private duties of man? Can I mark its limits— Its modifications of active and passive faith—of confidence, and fidelity? Can I sift the question how far Faith, is or is not dependent upon the will? and above all can I approach the question when and how far Faith may be violated without wrong—when and how its violation may be matter of indifference—when and how it may become a dictate of indispensable duty? And can I dress up all this matter—with seasoning to make it palatable for an hour and a half to a popular auditory who would not endure for a half an hour in a Sermon? I make with intense and foolish anxiety the attempt— Foolish, because after all a dull Lecture, would not be a very crying sin— My mothers Letters, Bancroft’s History, Broughams Oration for the crown, and this Evening Brownson’s defence of his Article on the laboring classes divided with newspaper trash, the reading hours of this day. I read half a dozen of my mothers Letters every day—economizing exquisite enjoyment, by taking it in small parcels— I can read scarcely one of them but with a stream of tears.— Charles hopes the publication will succeed, and says the bookseller told him he had sold 200 copies in five days from its first exposition for sale— This is moderately promising, but if the whole edition is not sold within a month, there will be little demand for the book ever after— As a double monument of Memorial to my mother and Son, it affects me so deeply, that my judgment of it, is all absorbed in feeling. The Ladies took tea, and spent the Evening at Charles’s house— I walked there in the dark; but the road was so miry that I rode with the Ladies home— I took with me Augers French translation of the Oration for the crown to compare him with Brougham— As to Mr Orestes Augustus Brownson I must use him at leisure, for a trial of temper.

                "text": "4. IV:30. Sunday.  Sun set 5:39.  Communion day— Mr Lunt preached this morning, from Matthew 11.25. “At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth; because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes”—an argumentative and eloquent discourse upon the character and history of the Christian religion, comparing the obscurity, and feebleness of its origin with the magnificence and grandeur of its results. The lowliness of its founder with the sublimity of its purpose, and the vastness of its expansion— This is a theme upon which it is easy to be impressive, and impossible to exaggerate— If the personal history of Jesus Christ were all a fable, the miracle of the system would remain as inexplicable to human reason as it is to account for the facts. Mr Whitney joined, and took his part in the administration of the Communion—but he has passed the critical corner of three score years and ten, and is tottering to the last stage of all, which ends this strange eventful history— Mr Lunt’s afternoon sermon was from Matthew 3.11. “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you, with the holy ghost and with fire.” The humility of John the Baptist, in proclaiming himself only the precursor of the Messiah was particularly noticed—but I want from Mr Lunt, an entire discourse upon the history, character, genealogy, birth, life and death of John the Baptist—of whom Jesus himself declared that among those that were born of women there was not a greater prophet— With regard to the language of the text Mr Lunt remarked that there in physical nature three materials of purification—Water Air and fire—and that the saying of John the Baptist, had allusion to this when he said figuratively that Christ would baptize with the holy ghost, and with fire.— Mr Lunt gave notice that from this time forward, for the winter the Sunday morning bell would be rung at half past ten, and the afternoon, at a quarter before two— The day was fair and the sky clear— I saw the Sunset in all his majesty from the porch of Charles’s house— The midshipman John Quincy, and his Sister Elizabeth spent the Evening here, as did Charles and his wife— I read a few of my mother’s Letters and a few pages of Bancroft’s History; but the burthen which now weighs me down is the Dissertation upon Faith, into the metaphysical part of which I am wading beyond my depth— My argument is assuming a religious complection from which I was desirous if possible of escaping, but which I perceive is unavoidable. As yet I am labouring it to lengthen it out, but before I finish, I may perhaps find it necessary to contract the field of discussion— I give myself till this day week to finish it, but shall find it necessary to labour in season and out of season, to bring it to a conclusion.

Deacon Spear was here this morning, and told me that Mr Humphrey the Surveyor had agreed to come with him next Thursday, if the weather should be fair, and if not, the first fair day, afterwards; to go into the woods and measure the lot of woodland, derelict for want of an authenticated owner, but of which I am part owner, and the whole tax upon which the Assessors fasten upon me— They are to come at 9. O’Clock in the morning, and I desired Deacon Spear to ask my Son to go with us. Mr Peter Whitney, paid us also a morning visit— Very much gratified with my Son’s Lecture of last Thursday evening, which he wished might be published— He spoke also with warm approbation of the Memoir prefixed to my mothers Letters; and of the Letters themselves—and said he wished to see more of them.— This experiment is still upon trial— Mr Rogers of Marshfield, with his Son Dr Rogers came to converse with me concerning the petitions from the towns of Marshfield, Hanover and Pembroke, for a new survey, preliminary to an appropriation for the clearing out of obstructions in North-river— I told him that the petitions had at the last Session of Congress been referred in the House of Representatives to the Committee of Commerce, together with the old Petitions from Scituate for an appropriation to effect the improvement recommended by the report of the former survey— I observed that the petitions were in conflict with each other, and asked if the parties interested could not come to some compromise among themselves, as the effect of which their petitions would not clash with each other— Mr Rogers complained that Mr S. A. Turner, and the people of Scituate harbour had not been quite fair, in their exertions to obtain the removal of the obstruction at the precise spot most favourable to them, who in point of numbers bore no proportion to those who wished for the new survey; but he did not encourage any expectation that the parties could come to any agreement respecting their opposite petitions— He expressed a wish that I would go and visit them at Marshfield, for which I fear I shall not be able to find time this autumn; and he requested me ask Mr Webster for perusal of the papers which they sent to him with their Petitions last winter, which I promised to do— Charles told me that Mr Fuller, the Administrator of the two Moses Gills, had determined to decline accepting the proposal I made at the probate Court in Boston, to compromise the matter of the claim upon the Estate of Ward Nicholas Boylston, and had called upon John Lane Boylston for an Account as trustee for the annuity which his father had secured to the second Moses Gill— He thinks Mr Fuller is advised to go into the Law, upon this matter, and that it will cost him more than the whole amount of the claim— I am so much engrossed with the Lecture upon faith, that I have no time now to give continuous attention to any thing else— Charles and his wife spent the Evening here.

The Caledonia, the third of Mr Cunard’s line of Royal Mail Steam-packets from Liverpool to Halifax and Boston; arrived at the wharf East-Boston last Saturday Morning, having left Liverpool on the 19th. of last month, the day of our return from our excursion— The Acadia had arrived at Liverpool on Sunday the 13th. at Midnight, the day of our arrival at Houlton— It is scarcely possible for me to realize the rapidity with which these Steamers accomplish the passage across the Atlantic— I chanced to be reading my mother’s journalizing Letter to my Aunt Cranch, of her voyage from Boston to Deal in June and July 1784. fifty six years bygone an excellent summer passage of 30 days.— And now in 34 days, I have learnt here the arrival in England of the vessel in which I embarked for Halifax on the first day of September. There is one more ship to be put upon this line—The Columbia, after which they are to depart twice every Month— The three ships in succession the Britannia, Acadia and Caledonia have performed their voyages in an average of 13 days, touching at Halifax both coming and going.— Harvey Field was here this morning, and spent with me two or three hours talking of trade, farming, house building and selling and politics— He is collector of the parish tax, and I paid him 209.12 the amount of my tax for the present year, 149.25 of which was his payment of rent to me, for the Penn’s hill farm— He is desirous of having renewed the lease of that, together with Lewis Bass and Mr Wilde for 5 years more. I referred him for all this to my Son. He asked me for a list of all the towns in the 12th Congressional District, which I gave Charles for him— He was much delighted with Charles’s Lecture last Thursday Evening, and wishes him to deliver another.— Mr Smith came out from Boston again, with another, elder Sister to repeat the invitation from the New-York Lyceum to deliver a Lecture before them, sometime in the course of the next Month— Wearied out with importunities, I gave him a conditional promise that I would comply with the invitation if it should be in my power. His Sister also asked me for an autograph of my father; and I promised to look up and send her one— Charles went to Boston, and returned to dine— He purchased for me ten shares of the Boston and Providence rail-road stock at 95 1/2 for which I gave him a check on the Quincy Stone Bank for 955 dollars— The ladies took tea at Mrs. T. B. Adamss—and I walked with Charles there in the Evening— Found Elizabeth De Wint there.— Her mother left Boston to return home to Fishkill Landing last Saturday. Mr Simmons had also been this afternoon at Mrs Adams’s, but was gone before we got there.— We walked home— In the reading of my mother’s Letters I have reached the period after the close of the revolutionary War, and a smoother Sea. They still affect me beyond expression— I read some pages of Brownson’s defence— To pass from my mother’s Letters to the effusions of this viper, is like a leap from Paradise to Purgatory— I went to Charles’s house and saw the Sun rise at 6:3. and again and saw him set at 5:36 Fahrenheit this morning at 48. Day warm with clear Sunshine— "

While we were at breakfast this morning, I was called out by two young men, who introduced each other by the names of Bannister and Moore— They wished to see the Library given by my father to the town, which I accordingly shewed them. Mr Moore said that he was a lawyer, and might wish occasionally to consult the books in the Library. He had heard that it was open for the use of the Inhabitants of the town. I told him that it was so, and that if he wished to come and consult the books, I would have a table placed in the chamber for his convenience— I had heard that this young man had recently come to this town to practice the law, for which John M. Gourgas appears already more than enough— The next visitors were judge Thacher from the State of Maine, and Mrs Thatcher, a daughter of the revolutionary General Henry Knox— The other daughter is at present the wife of Mr John Holmes— Judge Thacher spoke to me of a claim of the children of General Knox, for 1100 acres of land under a resolve of the old continental Congress for his service in the revolutionary War. He did not know whether the General had ever received the land or not, and enquired if I thought the information could be obtained at Washington— I supposed it might, at the general Land Office, and offered to make enquiries when I should go on to Washington as I propose next Month— He promised to write me a statement of the claim, and of the particular information desired, of which I take note to be remembered at the proper time He said it was reported in Maine that the present Legislature of the State, now in Session had it in contemplation to take the choice of electors for the ensuing presidential election from the people, and to choose them themselves, which I can scarcely credit— Mr Lunt was also here this morning and introduced Mr William Joseph Adams, a teacher of one of the public schools in Boston, who is engaged in compiling genealogical notices of the family and descendants of the first Henry Adams of Mount Wollaston— I lent him the copy of his Will which came from Jedidiah Adams; and also the transcript from the first Volume of the original town Records of births and marriages and deaths at Braintree— This William Joseph, is a lineal descendant from the second Henry, of Medfield through a succession of four generations by the name of Moses.— his elder brother is the 5th. of that name.— George W. Beale junr was here this Evening.— I found in the National Intelligencer of the 3d. inst a curious Article upon John Forsyth and the Pope Gregory 16. with the Popes Bull of 3. December 1839. against the African Slave trade. Mr. Forsyth in an electioneering Letter to a democratic committee in Georgia attributes this Bull to English influence— I had long been wishing to see this Bull, of which I had before heard, but which had not been published in any of our Newspapers. Forsyth’s Letter is in Niles’s Register. "

Mr William Joseph Adams, came this morning, and returned the Volume copied from the Braintree Records and the other papers that he had yesterday borrowed— Neither his researches nor those of Dr Shattuck have discovered much additional information concerning the Adams family to the scanty notices which had been collected before. Immediately after breakfast, Mr Humphrey the Surveyor came with Deacon Spear and his Son, and we went with my Son, and surveyed the lot, the property in which has not yet been fully ascertained, but for which I have been many years taxed— On the 14th. of October 1834. I visited this woodlot with Deacon Spear, notice of which is in my journal of that day. Vol. 12. p. 421. since which I have done nothing concerning it— We now surveyed it regularly with chain and compass, and Mr Humphrey will make a plan of it, upon which we can afterwards proceed. We returned just in time for dinner. I invited Mr Humphrey to dine with us, but he declined. Ruth Turner is here, upon mantua making work.— Mrs T. B. Adams her daughter Elizabeth, with Mary Harrod and Elizabeth De Wint took tea here, and spent the Evening— The Midshipman John Quincy came in after tea— Charles and his wife was here of course.— My excursion into the woods cut short my journal for the day, but I did not intermit the portion of writing on the Lecture upon Faith— Yesterday Morning I waked up not knowing the hour, and upon lighting my lamp, and coming into my chamber found it was two O’Clock— It was warm so I sat down at my desk in my loose gown, and wrote upon my lecture till four—then went to bed again, and dozed till six—broad daylight, and just before Sun rise— Brownson’s defence of his Article upon the labouring classes, and my mother’s Letters, occupying my reading time for the present— Brownson covers his attack upon religion—by pointing it against the priests—under which denomination he includes all regularly settled clergymen— He professes the Quaker creed, and greatly admires their meetings of silent meditation— But his greatest of all abhorrencies is poverty, as a remedy for which he proposes to abolish all hereditary property— Men are to dispose of their property at their pleasure while they live, but when they die it is to revert to the community— This he deduces as an irresistible consequence from the natural equality of men, and from the principles of Democracy. Brownson has a petty Office, given him by the Collector of the customs at Boston George Bancroft, whom he accordingly bedaubs with fulsome flattery— The drift of all his discourse is to inflame the passions of the poor, against the rich, and as Van Buren’s policy must be to sustain the institution of Slavery, Brownson stoutly affirms that Slavery is better than the system of free labour.— Some of his opinions are so odious that the leaders of his party dare not endorse them—they complain that he has brought them out too soon— He replies to this objection by repeating the doctrines, and blustering about his Independence— "

                "text": "9. IV:30. Friday  The last four days have been so warm, that I have had no fire in my library; but I was obliged to come to it again this afternoon. Charles went to Boston this morning, and returned to dine— He and his wife and two elder Sons, dined with us, and Mr Lunt, who told us that George and Augustus Whitney, had prevailed upon the Sexton of the Stone Meeting house to open the tomb in our grave-yard, where all the past Ministers of the church lie buried— That a parcel of bones was all that they found there except a small piece of wood, the remnant of Mr Wibird’s coffin, and a tinplate— That his skull was entire—that George Whitney took it out of the vault, and expressed some desire to carry it away.— The whole procedure struck us, as neither very regular, nor very delicate— Charles and his wife did not stay to tea, but came in afterwards and passed the remainder of the Evening here— I was occupied nearly the whole day in endeavouring to retrieve the lost time of yesterday—without success— I got through the reading of Brownson’s defence, and incline to prepare a Lecture upon Democracy. I am drawing near to the close of that which I am now writing. It will be as long as I could have desired, but is altogether unsatisfactory to me, and I fear likely to be not less unsatisfactory to the hearers. I have not been able to gather into it all that I wished to say on the subject; nor to methodize it into a regular dissertation— The two main positions which I wish to establish, are truths infinitely important to religion and morals. 1. That religious faith, and moral faith are one and the same principle and 2 That religious faith is dependent upon the will— The great fault of the subject is that it is Dry as dust, and I fear will prove as tedious as a dull Sermon, while it must be as long as three. The part which I have failed to work into the composition is the successive enumeration of the Covenants of God with man, recorded throughout the Bible, and an impressive series of illustrations of the transcendent importance of faith as a rule of morals.— I ought to write this Lecture over again, or another on the same subject— My mother’s Letters continue deeply to affect me, as I read them; about half a dozen a day.— They bring back to my recollection so many scenes that I passed through, and which were almost obliterated from my memory, so many persons, with whom I was acquainted, and some of whom were my dear friends, and above all so many tokens of tenderness and affection more that maternal, which she heaped upon me throughout her life, that I can scarcely touch the book, without falling back into childhood— The merit of the Letters as literary compositions, though always known to me, never struck me so forcibly as in this collection. Very favourable notice of them has been taken in the North-American Review, the Boston Daily Advertiser, and this day in the Courier.— The Bookseller told Charles this day, that about half the edition of 1000 copies has already been sold.

Jonathan French some time my gardener, now teacher of one of the town schools, came with one of his boys, a son of Mr Gillett the stage driver, and asked to see what he called the record of the Adams family; by which he meant the old table of concentric circles made in 1799. by Elijah Adams of Medfield, which I shewed him— He said that Gillets son wanted to make out a similar table of his own family; but I imagine that the teacher wanted it as much as the pupil. This passion for genealogy, seems to be anti-democratic, but it is deeply seated in human nature— I feel it intensely myself, and often regret that the first and second Henry Adams, left no memorial of their emigration from England, whence they came and when—and what relatives they left in England.— Of the first and second Joseph Adams, the birth, marriages and death are recorded on the parish or town books: the copies of their Will, and town records contain a few very scanty notices of incidents in their lives, but not a book or scrap of paper remains— Willards body of Divinity is the only book of my grandfather’s that has come down; to that folio volume, printed in 172he was a subscriber, and in a blank leaf before its title page are entered in his own hand-writing the date of his marriage with Susanna Boylston, and of the births of his three Sons, John, Peter Boylston and Elihu— He was a Selectman of the town, and Deacon of the Church, but his education was only that of the town school, and his condition of life, much like that of the brothers Ebenezer and Josiah Adams of the present day— That I suppose was the condition of the family from the settlement at Mount Wollaston—till my father. Harvard College, made my grandfather’s elder brother Joseph Minister of Newington, and my father’s Cousin Zabdiel Minister of Lunenburg. A spark of etherial fire in the Soul of my father, kindling at the lamp of that call made my father a scholar, a lawyer, a patriot, a Statesman and one of the prime founders of the greatest republics that ever honoured the race of Man. That father, a mother worthy of such a husband, Harvard College, Leyden University, seven years of youthful travel, and the blessing of Heaven, have made of me a common-place personage, par negotiis nec supra—just able to sustain the position in which they placed me, and about to disappear from the Stage, leaving nothing behind me worthy of being remembered in after ages.— Having lived with unceasing aspirations for unfading glory as a benefactor of mankind.— The spark of ethereal fire descends not from sire to son— A proof of this will be seen, in my Lecture upon Faith, this day finished—for the measure of a man’s mind is in every paper that he composes for public exhibition— If I try again it will be with no better success.— My wife, with Mrs John and Mrs Charles went to Boston this afternoon and returned to tea— I visited my garden and Nursery and gathered walnuts and English Oak Acorns, but planted none.

                "text": "11. V. Sunday.  Sun beclouded— Cold rain. Evening clear.Full Moon  Morning Sermon from Mr Lunt Ezekiel 1.28.— “This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.” He had read the whole first chapter of Ezekiel, and had given out the 100th. Psalm, and the beautiful hymn of Watts, the 61st. of Belknap’s collection— The Sermon was an admirable exposition of the vision, with the narrative of which the prophet introduces his Message from the Lord.— He noticed the time and place of the vision—the fifth day, month and year, by the river Chebar in the land of the Chaldeans— The whirlwind from the North, the living creatures with their four faces of a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle—the wheel within the middle of the wheel—the firmament over the living creature,—the noise of the wings like the noise of great waters—the throne above the wheels, and the likeness of a man upon the throne— The allegorical meaning of all this was explained with great ingenuity, and how it all concurred to form the likeness of the glory of the Lord— The connection between this Book, and the Apocalypse of the New Testament was not alluded to, nor the supposed designation of the four evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John— The remarks upon the temper of mind suited to the discharge of the duties of the prophetical office were impressive and their application to the prophetical functions of the Christian ministry of modern times, though not directly made were sufficiently perceptible in the tenour of the discourse— The afternoon text was from Acts 17:11. “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so”— The comparison between the Thessalonians and the Bereans, with regard to the reception of the gospel, is more of a common topic for a sermon, than the vision of Ezekiel— There can be no novelty in the discussion, but Mr Lunt always commands the attention of his auditory, and always gives them matter for useful meditation. He read this afternoon a notification that the annual convention of the friends of education in Norfolk County would be holden in this first Congregational Church, next Wednesday at ten O’Clock in the forenoon— That an Address would be delivered by the Honourable Horace Mann, the Secretary to the Board of Education, and that several interesting questions would be discussed in relation to the best modes of governing and examining schools. All interested, as well ladies as gentlemen were requested to be present, especially School Committees and teachers—and friends of the cause from other parts of the State— The Norfolk County Association for the improvement of Common Schools are to hold their meeting at the same time and place, and a full attendance is desired— Mr Degrand came out from Boston; dined with us, went to meeting with me this afternoon, and spent the remainder of the day and evening with us— He brought us the Boston and other Newspapers, which give favourable accounts of recent elections held in the States of Delaware and Maryland— The prospects at present are that Martin Van Buren’s Administration will terminate on the 3d. of March next, and that William Henry Harrison of Ohio, will succeed him as President of the United States— Quod felix faustumque sit— I have not yet dared to indulge myself with the hope.

Mr Lysander Richards the present President of the Quincy Lyceum came to enquire if I could deliver the Lecture which I have promised, before that Institution next Wednesday week; and I engaged accordingly; but the pressure upon my time is insupportable— I received this day a Letter from Joseph E. Sprague of Salem, most earnestly intreating me to deliver a Lecture there— I have three applications pending from Boston, and one from Brooklyn Long Island besides numbers which I have declined— I commenced this day a second Lecture, to succeed the one which I have finished upon faith—but I have no plan for this second one, and I know not where it will lead me— I have debarred myself from the discussion of political subjects while all others are uncongenial to my taste, and foreign to my qualifications— I find indeed that upon whatever subject I begin, my thoughts involuntarily run both into religion and politics. Subjects frequently occur to me upon which I fear to begin; apprehensive that they would absorb more time than I can bestow upon researches necessary for treating them suitably— And there is something consummately ridiculous in travelling 3 or 400 miles, to deliver a lecture which nine-tenths of the hearers will yawn through the meeting where it is to be pronounced— Mr Cornell, and Mr Moore the young Lawyer recently moved into this town came this afternoon—requesting to visit the town library— Mr Moore borrowed the first Volume of the Quarto Blackstone, and Mr Cornell the first and second Volumes of Goldsmith’s History of England— Mr Moore boards with Mr Cornell, and the Mr Chamberlain who came here with him last week is now preaching at the orthodox church.— Mr Baynes who brought me last autumn a letter of introduction for Dr Codman, did not remain here more than three months, and is now preaching at Amesbury. Mr Cornell has about 20 scholars and repeated the invitation to me to visit his school— I called at the Quincy Stone Bank, and took my balanced book, and occupied a considerable part of the morning in settling some of my monthly bills.— After dinner I wrote two very short Letters—one to George Fuller of Medford, and the other to Francis Hall joint Editor of the Commercial Advertiser, who had written to me, requesting a copy of my Oration upon the life and character of La Fayette, for a correspondent of his in lower Canada.— I send him a copy accordingly. The volume of my Mother’s Letters still holds out, and still affords me a daily hour of exquisite enjoyment— Several of the Letters I had never before read.— Those to myself are more admirable than they seemed to me when I received them— Charles and his wife spent the Evening here, and E. Price Greenleaf.— Ruth Turner is still at work here; and Miss Sampson up the hill at Charles’s. "

Alpheus Spear was here this morning; and paid the quarter’s rent due the 30th. of last Month— We left for after arrangement to which I must not fail to attend, the parish tax upon the Mount Wollaston farm, and the releasing of the farm, from and after the 31st. of next March. The Midshipman my namesake was also here this forenoon, and Mr Loring of Hingham after dinner.— He told me that the administration party of the 12th. congressional District had held their Meeting yesterday, and had nominated Morton Jackson as their Candidate for the next Congress, and he seemed apprehensive that the abolitionists of the District would also vote for him, and he was evidently more uneasy for the result than he was willing to acknowledge— The aggregate vote of the 24 towns in the District, last year was a majority for Governor Morton, although the abolitionists voted for Mr Everett. The abolitionists this year have nominated Seth Sprague junr. but he is absent in Europe, and Loring thinks they will vote for Jackson; a fiery abolitionist. He said that Mr May of Scituate was friendly to me, and wished to see and converse with me, upon the subject— That he had been sore upon my declaration against the immediate abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia, but that he was disposed overlook that on a pledge from me in favour of a prohibition of the Slave trade in the District— I told him I should be glad to see and converse with Mr May; but I gave no encouragement to the idea, of calling upon me for a pledge— The whigs of the District are to hold their Convention at Plympton to-morrow. It is probable, but not certain that they will nominate me. If they do, and the abolitionists vote for Jackson, he will carry the election against me— If they vote for Sprague there will be no choice.— There is not in the United States a District in which the issue is more uncertain, and my mind must be made up to bear the last stroke of dismission from the public service, by the total abandonment of the people— Mrs Edward Miller, Elizabeth C. Adams, and Mary Harrod, were also here— Miss Harrod takes her departure to-morrow for New-Orleans— Mrs Morton and Sarah Apthorp called to visit my wife; but she was engaged, and I thought she was out. Mrs Morton is four-score years of age, and retains a ruin of her former beauty—with apparent good health— Charles went to Boston, and returned to dine; and sent me the unexpected intelligence of the success of the whigs at the elections in Georgia— I rode with the Ladies to Mr John Greenleaf’s, and saw in her chamber his wife, my Cousin, once Lucy Cranch.— She is suffering with a disease which it is apprehended she cannot long survive— She told me she believed the wife of our ancestor John Norton was a daughter of Daniel and Elizabeth Mason. I walked home. Charles and his wife were not here this Evening. "

Just before ten this morning I called at French’s tavern, and enquired for Mr Mann who was there— I found Mr Pettes with him, and Mr Lunt— I invited them to dine with me— They were both engaged to Mr Lunt, but he released them in my favour— The meeting of the Norfolk County Association friends of education and the Society for the improvement of common Schools, was exceedingly slender, certainly not amounting to one hundred persons including at least one half women.— Even of the Committee of Arrangements who had been appointed to rally a numerous meeting, Mr Pettes was the only one present; Mr Cozzens being out upon a journey; and Mr Ira Cleveland detained by the necessity of attending a political Caucus— A Committee of 3. was appointed to report sundry Resolutions for the Convention to consider and they reported them, all apparently prepared by Mr Mann, and which were adopted after some discussion, and an amendment of the first resolution which left it much as it was— Mr Barnard a Secretary of the board of Education in Connecticut made some very interesting remarks respecting the condition of the School houses in that State. Between 12 and 1. they adjourned till 2. and ten of the company whom I invited came home and dined with me, together with my Son— While we were at dinner Mr E Wright came with a subscription paper for a translation of La Fontaine’s Fables with a Lithographic caricature print to each fable.— As I could not well attend to this gentleman now he promised to come again to-morrow. As we were returning to the Church after dinner, Mr Barnard said he was charged with an invitation from a joint literary historical association at Hartford, and New-Haven, to deliver an introductory Lecture before them on my way to Washington. I promised an answer at an early day— These invitations multiply upon me, most oppressively— The afternoon meeting was rather more thinly attended than that of the morning— The Officers of the Association were re-elected for the ensuing year and Mr Mann delivered his address; occupying nearly two hours, though he appeared to read not more than half what was written— A truly eloquent discourse upon the duties of Parents in the education of their children— The Convention adjourned at 5. O’Clock— Returning home I stop’d at Charles’s house and saw the Sun set. Coll. Josiah Quincy junr. and his wife were there, and took tea. They had been at the afternoon meeting— Mrs Charles had a severe head-ache— So had Mrs John, and our Evening party at home was small. "

I forgot to mention yesterday that Mr Lemuel Humphrey brought me the plan of the woodlot which we surveyed last Thursday, and for which I paid him 4. dollars— This morning Mr Wright came again with his subscription paper, for his translation of the Fables of La Fontaine— There are to be three editions at a price from 3 to 10 dollars for a copy. I had read several of those in the little volume he had left with me, and thought them very flat—much more so than the translations of several of the same fables that I had myself made,—a circumstance which doubtless biassed my judgment— I declined subscribing for the book— Mr Wright told me that he had been a Secretary of an Anti-Slavery Society; but that has now become a very unprofitable concern. Mr George G. Spencer of Hartford, Connecticut, brought me a Letter of Introduction from Mr Joseph Trumbull, a member of Congress from that State— Mr Spencer came to invite me to deliver a Lecture, before the young men’s Institute; the same which had been mentioned to me yesterday by Mr Barnard.— I told him that being uncertain when I shall proceed to Washington and whether I can take my way through Hartford, or not, I could not give him a definitive answer now, but would write to him in the course of a few days. Mr E. Price Greenleaf called this afternoon, and returned one volume and took out another of Muratori’s Annals of Italy from the town Library.— He told me that the whig convention, for the 12th. Congressional District had their meeting at Plympton— That the meeting was numerous, and had unanimously nominated me for re-election to the 27th. Congress— That the Delegates from Quincy had been instructed to urge the nomination of me, but had no occasion to produce their instructions— That no other person was named or thought of— That there were several abolitionists among the delegates, but they all concurred with the rest— He said Mr Rowe had been appointed a delegate from Milton to this Convention, but had mistaken the day, supposing it was this day, and had thus not attended yesterday; but that he would have voted with the rest.— I went this afternoon with my wife and Charles and his wife to Milton to visit Mrs Forbes, the widow of Ralph Bennet Forbes, and sister of Coll. Thomas H. Perkins, but she was not at home— Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us— Yesterday morning I finished reading the printed volume of my mothers Letters— They fill a duo decimo volume of 500 pages; and three volumes more might be published of those which she wrote, scarcely less interesting. I am still drudging upon a Lecture on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and upon Democracy. "

I received this morning a Letter from Mr Horace Mann the Secretary of the board of Education; mentioning that he had brought out a copy of the Abstract of the Massachusetts school returns for 1839 and 1840, intending to give it to me; but had forgetfully left it in his chamber at French’s tavern, where he requested me to call and claim it— I went accordingly, and it was delivered to me by Mr French’s Son.— It is an octavo volume of nearly 500 pages— At the Stone Bank where I called to make a deposit and draw 100 dollars by a check I found an Atlas extra with later and more favorable reports of the election in Pennsylvania than those received yesterday.— The election of Charles J. Ingersoll to Congress, by a majority of more than 1600 votes, in the third District, was a heavy damper to the exultation of the whigs, for it shews the public opinion has definitively settled down in the district, against the validity of Naylor’s election in1838. But the Atlas shouts Io triumphe for New-Jersey, where it boasts that the whole ticket of the whigs rejected last winter, has now been elected to the 27th. Congress— This is five times in number, and 500 times in principle, an equivalent for the loss of the third District in Pennsylvania— Naylor had sometime since declined standing as a candidate for re-election, which had cast ominous conjecture on the whole success. Mr John B. Newhall now of the territory of Iowa, being upon a visit to his friends and relatives in this State of which he is a native, called merely to indulge curiosity in seeing me— His father is living and resides at Lynn.— He emigrated in 1835 to the western country, and lives at Burlington, the principal settlement in Iowa, where he says there is now a population of 1500 Souls.— He gave me a crooked stick which he said was cut off from the spot where had stood the wigwam of Black Hawk, and he shewed me a beautiful map drawn by himself of the territory of Iowa, shewing that he has no lack of talent.— He left me at Noon to return by the Plymouth Stage to Boston— Mr and Mrs James H. Foster were also here before dinner, and Mr E. Price Greenleaf after dinner— He walked with me round my Garden and Nursery and Seminary, all which are looking desolate with the falling leaf and frost-bitten flowers— Charles and his wife were here this Evening, and I read to the family my Lecture upon Faith; to consult them whether it would be expedient to deliver it here or any where— It occupied an hour and ten minutes— They thought it might do at Quincy; possibly at Boston, but Not at New-York. I am making steady, but very indifferent progress in the composition of another. "

Congressional District, held last Wednesday the 14th. instt at Plympton by the whigs, to inform me that I had been unanimously nominated for re-election to represent the District in the 27th Congress, and he gave me a Letter signed by the three members of the Committee, containing the same information, with a request that I would accept the nomination— He read to me also from the Hingham Patriot a Resolution of the Convention declaring their unabated confidence in me; and left the paper with me— I told them that I accepted the nomination with a grateful sense of the Resolution with which it was accompanied— That I would answer their Letter; and should avail myself of the occasion to repeat what I had already stated to Mr Lincoln, that I had felt myself under a peculiar obligation to abstain from attendance at all the public meetings which had been held in the course of the present year having reference to the approaching Presidential Election— That a sense of propriety, had heretofore prescribed it as a rule to all Ex-Presidents of the United States, to abstain from all interference in the election of their Successors; and although the last President, Jackson had departed from that rule, as the present President Van-Buren has departed from another rule forbidding any candidate for the Presidency to canvass for himself, disapproving of these practices; I am unwilling to give countenance to them by following the example— That besides this any active electioneering on my part would be liable to the imputation of personal envy, resentment or revenge, and to the further interested motive of seeking to promote my own re-election to Congress. I had therefore refrained during this recess of Congress even from addressing my Constituents by Letter as I had repeatedly done before. Mr Lincoln intimated a wish that I should allude in my written answer to the Committee to these reasons for my silence, which I promised to do.— After dinner Dr Bowditch, and Mr James M. Barnard came, and repeated again the invitation to deliver a Lecture to the Warren Street Association—which I promised to do on Tuesday the 27th. instt.— I am to meet them at the chapel at half past 7 in the Evening, and they are to have a Carriage there ready to bring me home after the Lecture is over.— Ruth Turner has been working here as a seamstress several days, and took leave this Evening. Mary-Elizabeth Dawes is here, a companion to our Mary-Louisa. "

                "text": "18. V. Sunday.  Heard Mr Lunt; this morning from Hebrews 2.4. [“]God also, bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.” The necessity of the performance of miracles, by Jesus Christ himself, and his Apostles, to authenticate his mission from God, was stated and well-reasoned so far as it can be sustained.— The necessity cannot be demonstrated any otherwise than by inference from the fact— It was necessary because it was the will of God—for independent of that what necessity was there for miracles then, any more than now— Miracles, exhibited now, would propagate the gospel more effectively than any merely uninspired preaching.— And we see not why the Christian system of religion and morals could not have made its way by its internal evidence then as well as now. The truth is that at this day, the history, is the chief obstacle to the belief in the doctrines— There is great difficulty to believe the Miracles— The religious and moral instructions are all surpassing beauty— And Mr Lunt dilated with admirable eloquence upon the miracles achieved by Christianity upon the hearts and upon the conduct of mankind— This is a perpetual miracle and an inexhaustible theme. Mr Lunt dined with us; as did my Son. The afternoon text, following a prayer by Mr Whitney, was from Matthew 22.30. [“]For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the Angels of God in Heaven”— This was the answer to a captious question from the Sadducees who disbelieved a future state. They enquired which of seven husband that a woman had married successively on earth would be her husband in Heaven. The answer is that the relation of husband and wife will not be continued in the future world—whence it follows that there will be no relation of parent and child there. Mr Lunt speculated ingeniously, and feelingly upon the possibilities of our future state of existence; but there is little satisfaction in anticipations founded upon mere conjecture.— The resurrection of the dead to reward or punishment is a cheering promise and a tremendous commination, but what the reward or the punishment will be is veiled in impenetrable darkness— As there is no marriage, there can be no distinction of sexes; and though Milton says that Spirits can assume either sex at pleasure he had no warrant for the assertion, and knew no more about it than one of us.— There is no reason to believe that the Angels or Spirits of the just made perfect possess in Heaven the power of reproduction; or that they multiply otherwise than by recruits from Earth. Mr Lunt’s visions are pleasant—but I cannot take them for promises. Charles and his wife spent the Evening with us. "

Mr Clendenin a travelling bookseller who brought here this morning a Quarto Volume called Pictorial Geography—by Samuel Griswold Goodrich, but with whom Mr Clendenin says that Mr Jared Sparks is associated in the composition of the work. It is a system of Universal Geography with very few maps, and those on so small a scale as to be quite useless but with several hundred wood cuts a fashion of modern printing which may be, or might be made instructive— I declined subscribing for, or taking the book, the price of which was 7 dollars, and I supposed to be worth 3. Mr Goodrich himself called on me this afternoon, and in the Evening delivered an Address of an hour and three quarters before the whig Association of Quincy, at the town Hall— He told me what had entirely escaped my Memory that about 15 years since he went to Europe, that he visited me at Washington with an introductory Letter from his uncle Chauncey Goodrich with whom more than thirty years I had sitten in the Senate of the United States. I have only an indistinct recollection of having received such a Letter from Mr Chauncey Goodrich— I went to Charles’s house at their teatime, and met there Miss Sampson the seamstress— Charles went with me to the town Hall, where we were much amused with Mr Goodrich’s Address— A species of Oratory which he possesses in an eminent degree— Free, fluent, familiar he mingles up desultory argument with frequent droll, laughable stories, exactly suited to the taste of his auditory. He was continually cheered by shouts of laughter and clapping of hands.— The Hall was crowded to over-flowing— His topics were the anti-tariff and anti-bank, and anti-currency policy of Martin of Kinderhoek, and most especially upon the great plea for the subtreasury that it will reduce the working man’s wages.— As soon as Mr Goodrich closed his Address, Mr Brigham read a notification, that next Friday Evening Mr Isaac Hill of New-Hampshire would deliver an Address to the Democratic Association of Quincy— The political excitement is so great that scarcely an evening passes without a political Address; and the parties take the nights alternately— It has opened a new school of Oratory, which I fear will not deserve the name of a school of eloquence— After returning home I answered the Letter of notification of Messrs. Lincoln, Brigham and Richards the Committee of the whig Convention of the 12th. Congressional District, accepting the nomination— I am excessively cramped for time, to fill the daily record of my existence, and two pages of preparation for a Lecture— I am so hurried with that upon which I am now engaged that the composition will be the worst that I ever delivered.

I am hurried and worried with invitations to deliver lectures, till I know not what to do, and neglect business which ought to be indispensable— One of its consequences is that it sets my mind to wandering in search of subjects to make a variety and scatters my thoughts from those on which I have undertaken to discourse— I am drawing towards the close of the second of those which I am preparing for the present Season—and they are both too grave and dry— I rack my brain for one which will be amusing— This requires wit and humour of which I am lamentably destitute; and reflection whispers that the attempt to make others laugh recoils upon him who makes the experiment, and raises the smile at himself, when he is too heavy to carry the hearer with him— A very serious danger is that of ruining my Style by over hasty composition. General Dearborn, and Mr Joseph E. Sprague of Salem were here— I had received a Letter from Mr Sprague with an urgent invitation to deliver a Lecture before the Lyceum which I now agreed to do on Wednesday the 4th. of November. I had much conversation with these Gentlemen, on the recent news from Europe, and the prospect of a general War.— The Acadia arrived at Boston last Saturday Morning, having left Liverpool on Sunday the 4th. of this Month; and been detained 10 hours at Halifax— From the 1st. of September to the 17th. of October is 47. days both included, in which time this ship has completed both her voyages to and fro— This is marvellous in our eyes.— The prospects of War, are for the final dismemberment, and it is to be hoped extinction of the Ottoman Empire; and for breaking down the impenetrable barriers of the celestial empire of China— Here are two new doors opening wide for the extension of the power of man over the globe of earth— The prevailing opinion in Europe and here, yet is that there will be for the present no War, but there are strong indications of a kindling martial and mutually hostile spirit— The elections in the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio have just been held and the returns coming in daily keep up a constant excitement— There never has been so hotly contested an election and the result is yet extremely doubtful. My time was absorbed the whole of this afternoon from dinner till dark in searching for two papers, neither of which could I find— Miss Sampson was here. "

My wife, Mrs John, and Charles and his wife went nevertheless to Boston, and returned to dine; the Ladies having passed most of the morning at Dr Frothingham’s, and been obliged to postpone most of their shopping, to another day.— I was intensely occupied with the Lecture upon the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and democracy, till the carriage returned at 3.p.m— I find that when I commence a Lecture, I know not where it will lead me. I have begun a lecture on the Constitution of Massachusetts, with reference to democracy and I find myself slumping into Sir Robert Filmer, Algernon Sidney and John Locke— I have not Sir Robert Filmer’s works within my reach— But I have Locke and, I went over and brought from the town library two Editions of Sidney’s Discourses concernind Government.— One in 2. Volumes 8vo. Edinburgh 1750. with my fathers name 1766. written with his own hand on the blank leaf before the title page; and the other one quarto Volume—London 1772. With his Letters and his trial in addition to his Discourses concerning Government— Looking into these books I found not only matter pertinent to my Lecture but leading into the temptation to write another Lecture exclusively concerning Sidney, his life and writings—but this absorbed a considerable part of the day.— There is a deep shade of melancholy hanging over the whole life of Sidney, whose opinions seem to have resembled in many respects those of La Fayette.— The motto on his standard “Sanctus amor patriae dat animum”—the perseverance of his spirit—the harshness of his father, who contrived to keep well with all the prevailing parties during the civil wars and at the restoration of the Stuarts resumed his seat in the house of peers and became a privy Councillor—the abandonment of him by all his relations, and friends—his long exile of 17 years before his pardon was obtained, and the horrible baseness and cruelty of his trial and execution sink the spirits to read.— This afternoon Mr Green the editor of the Quincy Patriot, came with a message from Mr Lysander Richards President of the Quincy Lyceum requesting me to postpone till this day week the delivery of the Lecture which I had promised for this day, to which I readily assented, there being no prospect of an auditory in the foul weather of this Evening.— Charles spent it with us, but not his wife— I brought over also from the town library the report of the proceedings of the Convention of 1820 for amending the Constitution of this Commonwealth; but had not time to consult it this day.

The rain and foul weather continued through the Night and till noon this day, when it cleared off with a Northwester cold— Alpheus Spear was here, and brought a load of wood from the dead trees on the mount Wollaston farm— He spoke about his fence which he said he must remove if the Lease should not be renewed, before the frost should take hold of the ground. And that he would not give the same rent, on the renewal of the lease in the present condition of the meadows. I told him he might remove his fence when he pleased— The farm would be advertised, and he might renew the lease or not, at his pleasure; but not for the rent at which he now has it— My Son, his wife and three elder children dined and spent part of the Evening with us; but he was suffering with a very severe headache, and they left us early in the Evening. Russel Freeman was here this afternoon— He came from Sandwich on Tuesday, and now on horseback from Boston— He came to ask my advice about his prospect of recovering his place of Collector at New Bedford, from which Andrew Jackson removed him immediately after his inauguration as President in March 1829. He said he considered it as settled that General Harrison would be elected President—that the present Collector Smith’s commission will expire in January 1842. That all the respectable merchants at New Bedford are in favour of his restoration, but he believes Mr Clifford, an influential whig would be glad to obtain the place for his father in Law— What would I advise him to do— I said, to wait— General Harrison was not yet elected— It was not certain that he would be— If he should be I thought it probable that Mr Webster would be Secretary of the Treasury, in which case all the papers, which he Freeman had exhibited to the present Secretary Woodbury, would be on the files of the Department, and his prospects would be very fair. If Mr Van Buren should be re-elected and Mr Woodbury should remain in the Treasury Department, there would be no chance for any application from him— He told me over again the story of his poverty and the gradual decay of the little property that he had: but he said he was much comforted by the advice and hope that I had given him— Good wishes are all that I have or shall have to bestow— I was buckled down to the table the whole day— I was hurried through Algernon Sidney upon whom were it not that the theme is so melancholy I could occupy a month to great advantage. I took a short walk at Sunset, and plucked a few red wedge apples from the tree for seed— I finished my Letter to Mrs Henrietta M Dawson, and wrote one to Mrs M. Harrison Smith. "

My wife with our two daughters, and Mary-Louisa went to Boston and returned to dine—the Ladies for shopping and Louisa came back with a heart and cross for a necklace.— Mr Wright came, and took back his sample of the fables of La Fontaine in English verse, of which I advised him to publish rather a cheap edition, within the reach of every purse rather than a large book with magnificent caricatures to cost from 3 to 10 dollars— He thought it would be best to publish the splendid edition by subscription first, and the cheap edition afterwards— We conversed much upon abolition and anti-slavery Societies, about which, and their dissensions I gave him very freely my opinions— I told him that many of the them acted more like Bedlamites than like reasonable men, and instanced the ferocious attacks of Garrison upon him, and his crack-brained woman, no government, and non-resistance balderdash— He gave me a Massachusetts abolitionist extra of which he said he had several with him, but of which he is no longer the Editor.— He charged Garrison with having wronged him in publishing a private and confidential Letter which he Wright had written, but spoke of him with much reserve, and said the cause of abolition would prosper and triumph, in spite of all these snarlings among its advocates— He adhered tenaciously to the third party nominations, and was sure that however feeble they may now be, they would ultimately triumph.— This afternoon Mr and Mrs Abbot Lawrence, with their two daughters and younger Son came out from Boston and visited us— Mr Lawrence is slowly recovering his health and strength; but is, I fear immedicably diseased— Since he resigned his Seat in Congress, Mr Robert C. Winthrop has been nominated to succeed him and will undoubtedly be elected. Mr George W. Beale and his Son were here this Evening; and Charles, but not his wife, who was fatigued with her morning visit to Boston— The pressure upon my time, and upon my brain increases— This day I finished the second of the Lectures that I am to deliver before sundry Lyceums, and other associations, and began an attempt at the third; a subject from which I shrink as I approach it—China— At the first entrance upon its threshold, like a bather at a shelving beach I step forward to meet the tide and an overwhelming surge sweeps me back upon the land; too happy, if in its recoil, I can cling to the ground, and save myself from being swept back beyond my depth, and sunk into the fathomless deep— My first page has plunged me into the Laws of Nations, and I am frightened at the anticipated sound in my own voice— Vattel and Martens, and Ward, and the Parliamentary correspondence relating to China, what shall I do with you, in the compass of one fortnight?

                "text": "25. V. Sunday  Anniversary of my father’s marriage in 1764— New Moon—  Mr Stearns of Hingham preached morning and afternoon from Ephesians 6.13. [“]Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.” Fortitude against evil by the weapons of religion— This Epistle was written from Rome, when Paul was there in prison—written to cheer and encourage the church of Ephesus under the persecution which he and they were enduring— In this and the preceding chapter he has been urging upon them the system of Christian morals in contrast with their moral condition before they had been converted to faith in Christ— The whole epistle is a summary of Christian doctrine and ethics— He declares himself an Ambassador commissioned by God to unfold to them the mystery, of the admission of the whole heathen world to the blessings which had in preceding ages been confined to the chosen people of God. He then exhorts them to the practise of all the virtues—of Temperance, Prudence—Benevolence—to observe the relative duties of husbands and wives of Parents and children, of Masters and Servants, and lastly he summons them to Fortitude, to fervent prayer, to vigilance, and calls on them with reiterated solemnity to put on the whole armour of God, to stand against the wiles of the devil—a spiritual and defensive warfare, not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. This militant figure of speech is beautifully carried through in detail. The combatant must have his loins girt about with truth—he must have the breastplate, the greaves, the shield, the helmet, all defensive weapons, and lastly the Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. It is apparent that all this is especially applicable to the time when the Epistle was written, to the state and condition of the writer himself and to the Church of Ephesus to which it was addressed. Heathens converted to Christianity. This consideration should never be left out of sight in applying the precepts of Scripture to the present times. Christianity is still a spiritual warfare— Its powerful and inveterate enemies now are not the Jews and Heathen-Romans, but Infidels, and Profligates— Mr Stearns’s sermon took a different view of his text; and considered the Christian Fortitude enjoined in the text as bearing only on the ordinary evils incident to human nature. He dined with us; the weather was chilly and raw, portending snow. Charles and his wife spent the Evening here: but I was absorbed in the perusal of the voluminous Report to the British Parliament of the Correspondence relating to China. Not having time to read it deliberately through, and having undertaken to review it in a Lecture, I am compelled to skim it over, and I fastened upon it this Evening and glanced at the whole correspondence to the end, till it was near two O’Clock in the morning when I retired thoroughly chilled to bed.

I was upwards of an hour recovering from the chill with which I went to bed. About 3. in the morning I was awaked by a tremendous long reverberating thunder clap, soon after followed by another— Rising by broad daylight, and looking out of my library windows, the whole surface of the ground as far as sight could range was covered with snow, like Lapland in January, and the snow continued to fall with intermission till near noon.— Charles had intended to go to Boston, but postponed his visit there till Wednesday— In the intenseness of my desire to make progress with my review of the parliamentary document concerning China I lost the day for the diary and it went in arrear— I got entangled with Vattel, and Rayneval upon the Freedom of the Seas; and Bell’s account of the Russian embassy to China in 1719. and th account of Lord Macartney’s embassy in 1792. in Mavor’s collection of Voyages and travels, and Selden’s Hebrew Law of Nature and Nations; but above all the Newspapers swallowed up the daylight, till the dusk, when I went up the hill, and spent an hour at Charles’s, after which he and his wife from 8 to 9 in the Evening were here— I was worn out with multitude of occupation and by 10. retired to bed— The Newspapers are full of the charges of conspiracy of frauds to carry the presidential election, bandied between the two parties at New-York— In these frauds, Governor Seward, Mr Grinnell the member of Congress, a Mr Wetmore of New-York, Mr Swift, now Mayor of Philadelphia, on one side, and Benjamin F. Butler, ex-Attorney-General, of the United States, now District Attorney for the Southern District of New-York, Jesse Hoyt, collector of the customs at that Port, and a man named Edmonds, with many others on both sides are deeply implicated. The explosion began by a clandestine examination before a party judge of a criminal court in New-York, of two worthless characters, named Stevenson, upon hearsay from the other named Ghentworth, charging these distinguished members of the whig party with having imported from Philadelphia in 1838 men to vote and who did vote at the Election in New-York. The tables are now turned, and Ghentworth upon whose expected testimony the whole charge of whig fraud and bribery rested, has made an affidavit, charging Butler and Hoyt, and Edmonds with attempting to bribe him with promises of money and office to accuse Governor Seward, and the whig leaders with these frauds.— This mutual crimination and recrimination is exasperating the parties against each other to such a degree, that there is imminent danger both of fraud and violence at the approaching Presidential Election, which will terminate no otherwise than in civil War and a dissolution of the Union.

Mr Ellis Gray Loring of Boston, and Mr Lewis Tappan of New-York, called on me this morning, and earnestly intreated of me to assume as assistant Counsel to Mr Baldwin of Connecticut, the defence of the Africans captured in the Amistad, before the Supreme Court of the United States at Washington, at their next January term— I endeavoured to excuse myself upon the plea of my age and inefficiency—of the oppressive burden of my duties as a member of the House of Representatives, and my inexperience after a lapse of more than thirty years, in the forms, and technicals of argument, before judicial tribunals, and said I would cheerfully do, what I had heretofore offered that is give any assistance of Counsel and Advice to Mr Baldwin, and any other person charged with the argument before the Court— But they urged me so much and represented the case of those unfortunate men as so critical, it being a case of life and death, that I yielded, and told them that, if by the blessing of God my health and strength should permit, I would argue the case before the Supreme Court; and I implore the mercy of Almighty God, to controul my temper, to enlighten my Soul and to give me utterance that I may prove myself in every respect equal to the task— They promised that Mr Baldwin would furnish me with a complete brief and Mr Tappan left with me two scrap books, containing in slips from the Newspapers all the publications relating to the trials from the time of the capture by Lieutenant Gedney.— Mr Whitney came to take leave of us previous to our departure for Washington— Mr Lunt came afterwards— He is about to compile a new Hymn-book, for the use of the Church and Society here, and he asked me for the loan of my version of the Psalms with liberty to select any of them for publication in his book, to which I agreed, but could not find my manuscript. I promised to look it up, and bring or send it to him— I lent him Goode’s version of the Psalms— We dined at 1. and immediately after dinner, I went with my wife and Mrs John Adams to Boston— They set me down at Mr James H. Foster’s; after which they went shopping and returned to Quincy at the dusk of Evening.— I went to Charles’s house, where I saw Catherine— Then to Mrs S. A. Otis’s, to see Harriet Welsh; but she was out. Then called at Samuel T. Armstrong’s and Abbot Lawrence’s— Neither of them at home— Then at Mrs Samuel Dexter’s, and found her confined to her house with Lumbago. She seemed however cheerful, and is always intelligent— I then found the Warren Street chapel—went and spent an hour with Dr Frothingham— Then at 7. to Mr Foster’s, but he was gone. Charles Foster went with me to the Chapel where I delivered my Lecture upon Faith, from half past 7. to 9.— Then returned to Quincy in a Hack provided for me, by the Committee of the Association— Home at 10.

Wednesday—  Last Evening, after closing my Lecture, I received a note from Mr Abbott Lawrence inviting me to come and lodge at his house— Mr Foster had given me a similar invitation.— Mrs Felt, who was at the Lecture, did the same.— Harriet Welsh and Elizabeth De Wint, were also there, and Miss De Wint told me she wished to go with my wife and family to New-York— The chapel last Evening was full; but there were at least four women present, to one man— Except my own Relations, and Degrand, I saw there none of my acquaintance, except old Joseph May whom I had not seen for many years— Dr Bowditch asked if I should be willing to give the Association a copy of my Lecture, for publication, but I declined, as I proposed to deliver it at sundry other places—and indeed it is not worth publication.— As the carriage to bring me home was waiting at the Chapel door, I could not answer Mr Lawrence’s Note, but Mr Barnard promised to send him word, that I had previously arranged to return to Quincy— One of the Committee offered to come out with me, but I thought it too severe a tax upon his complaisance, and came alone. Dr Bowditch’s wife, an English woman said to me that an ex Subject of the very fine girl thanked me for my Lecture— This morning Deacon Spear and Harvey Field called together; and had some conversation with me about my farm, and a house and lot bordering on the Quincy Canal which Field wishes to sell— He returned last evening from a trip to Bangor to make a purchase of lumber, and brought back my Umbrella, which had been left on board the Steamer Bangor, when we landed in the Night at Portland. The Deacon spoke about making sale of the wood on the lot which we surveyed on the 8th. of this Month—but I referred him for all my business here to my Son, who went this morning to Boston, and returned to dine.— Mr Minott Thayer was here with a young man by the name of Ides.— My Son delivered a Lecture last Evening, to the whigs at Braintree, with which Mr Thayer was highly delighted. He promised to send me the 50 copies of my address of last year delivered before the Inhabitants of Braintree at Mr Storrs’s Meeting house— Mr Loring invited us to a political whig meeting at Hingham to-morrow Evening to hear Mr Caleb Cushing, but I have other engagements, and Charles has promised to deliver a political address to-morrow evening at Cohasset.— Mr Loring brought and shewed me a Letter from me to his Aunt Hannah Thaxter dated 16. Jany 1775 now in possession of his Sister Mrs Whittemore—and he told me that Mrs Nehemiah Parsons had a file of Letters from my mother to Mr John Thaxter.— This Evening at 7 O’Clock, I delivered at the town Hall the introductory Lecture for the Season, before the Quincy Lyceum. Charles went with me.— The Hall was full, but not crowded— Home at 9. "

I began the day this morning with the record of yesterday which I finished before breakfast— I then resumed my Chinese Lecture, and from the multiplication of matters for discussion in treating it, found that it cannot be properly considered in the compass of one Lecture; and made still more clearly the discovery of my own incompetency to discourse upon the subject at-all— And yet having undertaken it I must go through— The very first principles of the Laws of Nations are involved in the controversy, and the accredited writers, especially Vattel, rather offuscate than clarify the investigation— The History of China, and especially of the twenty-second of Tsing dynasty now occupying the throne, gives occasion for earnest enquiry, which I have not yet found the means to satisfy. I have thumbed over Vattel and Ward, and found sundry questions for debate. The Abbé Raynal’s Philosophical and political history of the European Establishments in the two Indies has an article concerning the origin of the Portuguese Settlement at Macao and a summary of the history of China, absolutely romantic— There was a fashion at the time when the Abbé wrote, among the philosophical French writers of extolling the Governments of all other Nations over that of France.— He himself was ultra-republican in all his opinions, and declamatory in his manner of presenting them; and yet he puffs up the Chinese government as if it were a model of perfection. The most absolute despotism upon earth, rotten with the filthiest corruptions affecting to look down with scorn upon all other Nations, one would suppose from his narritive the very model of perfection— It is impossible it shoul be true— A general description of China, translated from the French of the Abbe Grosier 1788 from which I have been unable to collect nothing of any value— An abstract in Mavors collection of voyages from the writings of the Jesuité Le Comte and Du Halde; not more profitable; and lastly Sir George Staunton’s account of Lord Macartney’s Embassy to China in 1792, which I had not even time to skim— There was rain early in the morn—and a heavy gale, with torrent showers was gathering the whole day— My Son, with his wife and three elder children dined and spent the day with us—and Ruth Turner— Captain Drew of Duxbury came to enquire the state of his petition before the house, for remission of a fine levied upon him at New-Orleans— I could not tell; but must ascertain at the approaching meeting of Congress.— Captain Drew said he was going to New-Orleans, and Europe again; but not to sail till after the 9th. of next Month. I wrote Letters to Mr Nelson Moore at Waltham, and the Revd. Charles W. Upham at Salem— "

IV:30 Friday  A Gale, almost a Hurricane, with heavy Showers of rain continued through the night and part of this morning.— The wind then subsided and it cleared up towards Night. Charles had some difficulty in getting home with his family and Ruth Turner who had been here at work. I was busily occupied all day.— Charles and his family dined with us, it being the last day before their return to the City for the Winter— Last Saturday Captain Josiah Bass came and introduced Mrs Harriet Spear who has a Son, enlisted as a boy in the Navy under the act of Congress, and now on board the Columbus in Boston Harbour.— Both mother and Son, are extremely anxious to obtain his discharge and she came to solicit my influence to obtain it— I advised her to write a letter to the Secretary of the Navy soliciting his discharge, and to send her Letter to me, promising to forward it, with an additional recommendation of my own— I have accordingly received her Letter, and this day, wrote to the Secretary of the Navy, enclosing it— I wrote also to Mr Nelson Moore, at Waltham; offering to deliver a Lecture there Saturday Evening of next week— At the dusk of evening I walked over the hill; the only exercise I have taken for two days— I continue my investigations for my Chinese Lecture, and deeply regret that I have not another month to examine, and discuss the whole subject— I am now on a critical analysis of the three first principles of the Law of Nations, laid down, by Vattel, and shewing their inconsistency with each other.— I am looking also for Chinese history, and especially for the succession of Emperors of the Mantchoo Tartar or Tsing Dynasty being the 22d. I find in the great Work of Du Halde that Tsong-te ascended the throne by conquest in 1644—but died immediately— His Son Chun-Tchi reigned seventeen years till 1661. succeeded by his son Kang-hi who reigned 60 years till 1722—then his son Yong-tching 13 years till 1735. the reigning Emperor when Du Halde’s work was published.—Then came Kien-Long—another reign of 61. years till 1796. when he abdicated in favour of his Son Kia-king— Kien-Long died in 1799 and Kia-King reigned till 1820. when the present Emperor succeeded— The newspapers still teem with the New-York plot and counterplot; the basest part of which is the tampering of the U.S. District Attorney, with two men of infamous character to run down the whig party with false charges of fraud at the Elections of 1838 and 1839. and the Star-chamber inquisitions of the Recorder Morris.

Saturday  My Son went this morning into Boston, with his family for the Winter— I was distracted with the settlement of monthly bills, and with arrangements for our departure next week for Washington. My wife and family propose to go on Monday. I have to deliver Lectures next week at Charlestown, at Salem, at Waltham, and perhaps at Boston— And I propose to stay till after Monday the 9th. of next Month being the day of the Elections— I called at the Quincy Stone Bank, and took an assortment of Bills and specie for the expenses of my family’s journey to Washington— At the town Hall where the Selectmen gave me a minute of the particulars of my tax bill for the town and County.— The Selectmen, are Charles A. Brown, Charles A. Cummings and Daniel Baxter— Cummings said he could not find the particular statement of my personal property, which my Son had given in— I called also at C. Gill’s shop and paid his bill for book-binding— Met J. A. Green in the Street, and requested him from this time to send my Quincy Patriot weekly to Washington— Mr Carr came with a subscription book for the whig Association reading room— I gave him a small contribution to purchase books for the room, but declined joining the association as a member having never been a member of any private political Society— Elizabeth C. Adams dined and spent the Evening here. Her brother John Quincy came and escorted her home.— I received this morning a Letter from Charles Johnston member of Congress from Dutchess County New-York, inviting me to deliver a Lecture at Poughkeepsie— I have also received similar applications, from Schenectady in New-York, and from Springfield in this State— Also from the College at Brunswick, to deliver the ΦB.K— Oration there next Summer. I find it impossible even to answer all these Letters; and fear I shall be obliged even to leave my lecture upon China unfinished— I took up this day Sir George Staunton’s account of Lord Macartney’s Embassy, and found much matter of entertainment, and much to the purpose of my Lecture— The name of the present Emperor is Taou-Kwang and he succeed Kia-King in 1820. This is therefore the 20th. year of his reign— "

[“]Evil pursueth sinners.”— A plain Discourse easily divided into illustrations of the manner in which evil pursues the different classes of Sinners.— The dishonest man—the intemperate man—the profane swearer—he did not touch upon the gambler, the fornicator, the infidel; nor specially upon the hypocrite— He had difficulty in reading his Discourse—his eyes, his teeth, his voice, his Memory are all in decay; his articulation is so indistinct, and his utterance so feeble that I heard not more than half his Sermon— Mr Degrand came out from Boston and brought budgets of newspapers and news from Philadelphia and New-York.— Richard Haughton Editor of the Boston Atlas came from Philadelphia yesterday morning at 9. O’Clock and brought reports of the election of Presidential Electors, the day before in Philadelphia, and the adjoining Counties of Bucks, Chester and Delaware— The result in the four Counties is favourable to the whigs, but the authenticity of the returns is not sure, and the gain is so small that there is little hope of Pennsylvania— The New-York papers are filled with electioneering plots and counterplots from which I cannot escape the conclusion that fraud and violence, are creeping and breaking fearfully into our elections— These practices were first introduced by the mob government party, who call themselves democrats, and one of their most impudent devices, is to charge their adversaries with their own crimes.— This they did but too successfully in the case of the New-Jersey election, and they are playing the same game over again in New-York. Mr Lunt performed the afternoon services, and preached from Genesis 25.27. [“]And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.” a beautifully contrasted character of the two brothers and of their fortunes and descendants— He attributed this to the difference of their religious principles: and while tracing the sublime and melancholy series of vicissitudes which have distinguished the children of Israel from the days of their progenitor down to their present dispersion all over the earth he marked its transcendent superiority over the brief prosperity and awful extinction of the race of the Edomites and the recently discovered ruins of their city upon the rock, now called, Petra. He referred to the 49th chapter of Jeremiah, the 25th. of Isaiah, and the prophesy of Obadiah.— Mr Degrand left us about 8. P.M. Mr Beale and his daughter Caroline were afterwards here. John Quincy and Elizabeth C. Adams dined with us. "

Smith came from Boston this morning with his Sister and proposed to change the day upon which I should address the New-York Lyceum, as I had conditionally promised on the 11th. of this month. I agreed to substitute the 18th. or the 25th. not being certain that I can reach New-York so early as the 18th and promising that if I cannot, I will give him timely notice. Miss Smith repeated a request which she had made before, and which I had forgotten; for an autograph of my mother, and one of my own— My Son also came out for an hour or two but returned before dinner.— He is nominated as a candidate, one of 35. from Boston, to the House of Representatives in the Legislature of this Commonwealth— It was urged upon him last year, but he declined. We had an early dinner; and at two O’Clock P.M. my wife, with Mrs John Adams, her daughter Mary-Louisa, and Jeremy Leary, left our House at Quincy to take the Stonington Railroad Cars at 4. for New-York, and Washington. Elizabeth C. Adams who had passed the Night here, went home to her mother’s, and I remained with Louisa C. Smith to go to the City to-morrow— I was under peine forte et dure with occupations—but Mr William Ellis of Dedham came and spent two hours of the afternoon, with me about the Pension claims of Relief Dunbar and others, the Pension of Benjamin Buzzey, Ogle’s speech, the furniture of the President’s house and other gossip. About Sunset Mr Horatio Moore, and Mr Burton came in from Waltham. I had written to Mr Nelson Moore, that I would deliver a Lecture to the Adams Association there next Saturday evening. They came to say, that by a previous engagement of the whig Association at Waltham the town hall would be occupied by Mr Robert C. Winthrop and Mr Franklin Dexter, in addressing the whigs on Saturday Evening, and it would be necessary to change the Evening for my Lecture to the Adams association, and I accordingly agreed to go, next Tuesday Evening, instead of Saturday— They wished me also to go to be there at an early hour of the Evening; and I agreed to be ready at my Son’s house, from half past 3 to 4 of the afternoon for the Carriage which they are to engage to take me to Waltham and back.— Being in some perplexity with regard to the second of my political Lectures, which is dry, dull, and too political, I took an old unfinished Essay upon Society written about twenty years ago, and wrote two pages, merely to bring it to a close, and I shall endeavour to pass that off for a Lecture.— It was written at leisure and is therefore much better composition than any thing that I can write now— Of course my labour upon the Chinese lecture is suspended, and I am ready to give it up in despair— I wrote unremittingly from the dusk of Evening till half past 11. when I retired to my solitary bed.

Brewster, Secretary of the Lyceum at Portsmouth N.H. inviting me to deliver a Lecture before them on Tuesday the 17th. or any other day of that week— Mr Foster said he was going this day to Portsmouth, to bring home his wife who has been spending some days there at his brothers. I desired him to inform Mr Brewster that I shall be obliged to proceed to Washington, on the 17th. and to say that I would answer his Letter— Mr Curtis of Roxbury came and left with me a Letter, from Petty Vaughan, unimportant and invited me to dine with him, next week on Thursday, and to deliver a Lecture that evening before their Lyceum; which invitation I accepted— I returned to Mr Curtis the Note from Moses Gill to Mrs Boylston— I visited at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s, Mr B. W. Crowninshield’s, and Dr G. Parkman’s but neither of them was at home— Dr. Frothingham called and passed an hour with me.— and afterwards Dr. G. Parkman—with whom I promised to dine, next Wednesday— As I was preparing to start for Salem, Mrs Charles told me that Harriet Welsh had been with her, and advised that I should deliver this Evening at Salem, and to morrow at Boston the Lecture on Faith, and not that upon civilization; several persons who had heard both, much preferring the first.

O’Clock—but I was wide awake, and Charles’s study adjoining my bed chamber was well-warmed— So I sat down in my flannel gown two hours, and wrote the diary of yesterday— I then returned to bed, and lay till 7. in repose, if with little or no sleep— Mr Foster came with a Letter from Charles W. Brewster, Secretary of the Lyceum at Portsmouth N.H. inviting me to deliver a Lecture before them on Tuesday the 17th. or any other day of that week— Mr Foster said he was going this day to Portsmouth, to bring home his wife who has been spending some days there at his brothers. I desired him to inform Mr Brewster that I shall be obliged to proceed to Washington, on the 17th. and to say that I would answer his Letter— Mr Curtis of Roxbury came and left with me a Letter, from Petty Vaughan, unimportant and invited me to dine with him, next week on Thursday, and to deliver a Lecture that evening before their Lyceum; which invitation I accepted— I returned to Mr Curtis the Note from Moses Gill to Mrs Boylston— I visited at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s, Mr B. W. Crowninshield’s, and Dr G. Parkman’s but neither of them was at home— Dr. Frothingham called and passed an hour with me.— and afterwards Dr. G. Parkman—with whom I promised to dine, next Wednesday— As I was preparing to start for Salem, Mrs Charles told me that Harriet Welsh had been with her, and advised that I should deliver this Evening at Salem, and to morrow at Boston the Lecture on Faith, and not that upon civilization; several persons who had heard both, much preferring the first. I walked down to the ferry boat at Lewis’s wharf, and precisely at 6 p.m crossed to Chelsea; took the Cars of the Eastern rail-road for Salem, and at a quarter before 7. found Mr N.

I had obtained from Mr Silsbee pens and ink, to write this morning before day-light— I rose at 5. but found the chamber so cold that I was obliged to give it up.— I returned to bed, and lay till 7— After breakfast Mr Silsbee walked with me, and I called to see Mr Upham, but he was not at home— We returned to Mr Silsbees, where several Gentlemen called to see me.— At 11. Mr Silsbee accompanied me to the depot, where I found Mr and Mrs Upham (she is a daughter of the late Dr Holmes of Cambridge, and a Grand-daughter of Oliver Wendell of former times[)]. There were several others among others Mr Treadwell who came on with me in the Cars to Boston— At the landing at East-Boston, I met Mr Kavenagh recently returned from Lisbon, where he has been several years chargé d’Affaires of the United States and where he has concluded a Treaty— I found Charles’s servant-man Edward waiting for me at the depot. After crossing the river I met Mr Stephen C. Phillips, now Mayor of Salem, who was absent from that City yesterday, and now returning home.— I reached Charles’s house, a quarter past 12. and Doctor George Parkman almost immediately after came in, then Mrs. Angier from Medford, who wished but had been unable to procure tickets for this Evening’s Lecture at the Masonic temple— The Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge, issuing no tickets for one evening but only for the whole course; but Dr Parkman undertook to procure two tickets for Mr and Mrs Angier; and did procure them, and they were sent to Mrs Angier, at Mr Edward Miller’s where she dined. Then Harriet Welsh, who held an argument with me to prevail upon me to deliver the lecture on Faith, instead of that upon civilization—and Mr Warren from Charlestown, who gave me a note from Mrs S. C. Alden, wife of Lieutenant Alden, one of the Officers of the exploring expedition, with a sample of a small fragment of stone from an Iceberg on the newly discovered Antarctic continent, and a slip extracted from a Sidney Newspapers, in New South Wales. Mr Warren told me that the Managers of the Charlestown Lyceum had determined to give the 15 dollars which according to their rules they had offered me, and which I had declined accepting to an infant school Association, with direction to receive it a donation from me— Immediately after dinner Mr Degrand came in with MrSturgis who has been several years in China; and with whom I had some conversation relating to that Country— Charles went and delivered a whig Lecture at Quincy— Mr and Mrs Carey came about 6. and Mrs Charles and her daughter Louisa Catherine went with them. Mr Gould accompanied me to the Temple where I delivered the Lecture on Civilization—house crowded— The Lecture well received. Harriet Welsh and Thomas Frothingham walked home with us, and passed an hour here. Bed about 10— "

Mrs Mary Jane Lawrence came, this morning, and represented to me with many tears her distressed condition, for want of the pension to which she thinks herself entitled as the widow of a man, who served as a Soldier in the last War with Great-Britain, and died in the service— Her case is one of those, upon which the existing Law grants a pension for five years which she has received. She cannot perceive the humanity of a Law which grants a pension for five Years and then stops it.— Nor do I— But Congress have hitherto inflexibly adhered to it, and I could not give Mrs Lawrence any cheering hope of a more liberal temper at the approaching Session— Dr George Parkman was here, and proposed to me to go with him to morrow Morning and visit the pauper establishments of the town at South-Boston, of which he says there are three, and I agreed to go— He told me that the man of the ticket office at the Masonic Temple, told him that there were 5000 persons turned off last evening, because there was no room to admit them into the Hall— Perhaps 5000 meant 200— Harriet Welsh came and I went with her and visited Mrs George T. Lee, to thank her for a copy of a Memoir of the Life of Miss Hannah Adams written by herself, and which Mrs Lee had printed a few years since, with a preface by herself— It was not printed for publication; but Mrs Lee had sent me a copy of it at the time when it was printed— I wanted last Summer another copy to send to Mrs M. Harrison Smith, and Harriet Welsh obtained it for me from Mrs George T. Bigelow— I sent it to Mrs Harrison Smith, and received a few days since from her a Letter of thanks; saying that she valued so highly the volume that she could not think of parting with it, and would have it transcribed to send to Mr Vail the information which he wanted.— While we were at Mrs Lee’s, Mr. Simmons the ex-abolition preacher at Mobile came in— They spoke of my last Evening’s Lecture, and Mrs Lee expressed a wish to read it— Her hearing is impaired, so that she attends no public Lectures.— I consented to her reading it, and Harriet Welsh asked my leave to take a copy of the two Stanza’s on wedded love, which I introduced into it, last Evening, which I also yielded— She took the Lecture to Mrs. Lee with a promise to return it, in a day or two— Charles returned from Quincy, where he delivered last Evening an Address to the whigs.— Mrs Frothingham, Dr Bigelow, and William Gorham were At 1/2 past three I went with Charles and dined at Dr Francis Parkman’s, with the Trustees of the humane Society— Mrs Parkman the only lady at table.— I had some conversation with Dr Palfrey, about his book and about China— We came home at 8. and Charles and his wife occupied two hours in collating my mother’s Letters for a second Edition.

The hospital for the sick, the bake-house and the kitchen were in different parts of the building and all appeared to be kept in perfect order— The arrangement of the workhouse was similar to that of the hospital, excepting that there was a separate call for each convict, and no common entry where they could communicate with each other. It was just as the men had dined each in his cell, and they were marched out in Indian file, in total silence, and each man, with his arms folded as he marched— The women were all in one large upper chamber seated in rows of chairs one before the other all sewing or knitting in silence without speaking to one another— The are two other establishments in that neighbourhood which we did not see.— The house of correction for vicious boys, and the asylum for the blind— Returning homewards Dr Parkman left me at Mr Abbott Lawrences door, and I paid him a visit— At home, Mr Ripley, the Minister of Waltham invited me to his house when I go to deliver the Lecture, next Tuesday. I said I had engaged to go, to be there about two hours before the Lecture and would cheerfully go to his house, if no other arrangement had been made by the Gentlemen, who are to come for me— Visits from Harriet Welsh, and Mr Edward Brooks, while I was out— At 4. P.M. I went with Charles and dined at the Tremont house, with the managers of the Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge. 16. at table—Dr Frothingham—N. Hale, B.

J. J. Carr came, and urged me to go and vote immediately, for he feared that they would close the polls, before dinner— I went with him and took a printed ticket on which were the names of Governor; Lieutenant Governor, Senators for the County—Electors of President and Vice-President U.S. Representative for the 12th. Congressional District and Representative of the town in the State Legislature— My own name was on the list for Representative in Congress— I tore it off, and then tore from it the name of Mr Brown, for Representative of the Town— I then offered the two fragments of the ticket, which the Select-man declined receiving— I then said I should not vote at all; and they consented to receive my two papers pinned together. After dinner I went first to the Bank, and took up a check for 100 dollars— Then to Mr Lunt’s, but he was gone to Boston—next to Mr John Greenleaf’s, where I met C. P. Cranch andDawes and saw Mr and Mrs Greenleaf, both of whom are confined to their chamber, probably never to leave it— I returned to Mrs Greenleaf the two Letters from her father to Dr Eliot the biographer, and to Mrs Elizabeth Guild— She says she believes that the maiden name of the wife of John Norton the minister of Hingham was Mason— Mrs Greenleaf’s two daughters Lucy and Mary Dawes are living with her— My last visit was at Mrs T. B. Adams’s, but she went on Saturday to visit her daughter, Mrs Angier at Medford, and had not returned. Mrs Phineas Foster, Mrs Stebbins, and Elizabeth C Adams were there, and the midshipman John Quincy Adams, who is waiting for orders from the Secretary of the Navy— I came home just before Sunset, having trudged all the afternoon through the rain and over shoes in mire— Alpheus Spear was here almost the whole evening—talking about the renewal of his lease: and he paid me the parish tax of 1840. on the farm— "

Wednesday  The life I lead is trying to my Constitution, and cannot be long continued with impunity— Repose and regularity of hours and occupations, are essential to my health and to what remains of my capacity for useful labour— I live in continual bustle; a succession of Chinese Shadows, successive banqueting, late and early hours and political excitement and conflict, which stretches my old machine upon the rack— My eyes are threatening to fail me—my hands tremble like an aspen-leaf— My Memory daily deserts me—my imagination is fallen into the sear and yellow leaf, and my judgment sinking into dotage— The day before yesterday, my Son was elected one of 35 representatives of this City of Boston, in the Legislature of this Commonwealth— This is his first entrance into public Life, and may the blessing of God shield, and protect, and cheer and prosper him in this career— On the same day I was re-elected to represent the 12th. Congressional District of Massachusetts in the House of Representatives of the United States— Should my life and health be spared to perform this service, I shall have been the only representative of the District during the ten years of its existedce— I had represented in one Congress the preceding District of Plymouth— Before the next Election for Congress the Districts will be re-organized and new modelled; and then will be a proper time for me to withdraw, and take my last leave of the public service. This morning I went with Charles’s wife, and her daughter Louisa-Catherine, and visited Mrs Dexter, and Mrs King, widow of Edward King of Cincinnati, Ohio, and daughter of Thomas Worthington, with whom I sat five years in the Senate of the United States.— She has been residing several years at Cambridge, superintending the education of her two Sons and of three nephews, all of whom have now been graduated— Her Sons are now at Philadelphia, whither she proposes to remove, to finish their education, one for the Law and the other as a merchant. We next visited Mrs Amory, whom I once knew as Mehitable Sullivan; then as Mrs Cutler, afterwards wife of my classmate Jonathan Amory, and now his widow— She is now 70 years of age and I knew her at 16. She was then as she is now an example for her sex, living in health and competence with a promise of many more years more of respected age— Mrs Charles then left me to go to her Sister Mrs Frothingham’s, and I called to see my old friend Benjamin Pickman, whom I found with his daughter, and his Sons widow, daughter of my mothers cousin William Smith— I told Coll Pickman I had seen his Son, at Annapolis Nova-Scotia, but he said he was not there with his approbation. At half-past 4. I went and dined with Dr George Parkman— His brother, S. T. Armstrong, R. G. Shaw, Mr Chapman, the Mayor, and others—of the company— Home at 8— "

                "text": "12. V. Thursday—  North-east and South-east rainstorm, the whole day and evening through— But after journalizing for yesterday—I wasted the remainder of the morning. Mr Isaac Waters was one of the Appraisers appointed by President Monroe at my recommendation, when the Law of Congress authorizing those Officers was first enacted— He held the Office, till General Jackson came to the Presidency in 1829. and was then immediately dismissed. He came now to put in his claim for restoration—and to solicit my influence in his favour.— He could not have sought a more inefficient patron; but he announced his intention to go to Washington to the inauguration of General Harrison next March— I called soon after noon at the Secretary of the State’s Office, in the State house, and requested him when the Governor and Council shall meet to count the votes, and issue the credential of my election, to make out and send me a list of the votes returned from the 24 towns of the 12th. Congressional District; which he promised to do.— I visited also Mr. Felt’s room, and requested him to ascertain, if among the provincial records there is one of the grant of Lands to my ancestor Coll. John Quincy, in consideration of his public services.— Mr Felt promised that he would— He said Deacon William Spear had been with him, and spoken about the woodlot in Braintree, in which Mrs Felt and I have a joint interest— Just then Mr Lincoln a member of the State Senate came in, and we were obliged to suspend the conversation— I called at Dr Bigelow’s— He was not at home, but I saw Mrs Bigelow, and thanked her for the copy of the Memoir of Hannah Adams, which she gave to Harriet Welsh for me, and which I sent to Mrs M. Harrison Smith— I visited at Mr Sidney Brooks’s, but the house bell wire was broken, and I could not rouse a Servant to come to the door.— Dr Frothingham was not at home— I came back to Charles’s, and found Mr. Nathaniel Curtis waiting for me.— I went with him and my Son to Jamaica Plains Roxbury, and dined with him at his house. Mrs Boylston and her two grandsons, Ward Nicholas and Thomas, sons of John Lane Boylston were there— Mrs Curtis, their Son and his wife, and General, and Mrs William H. Sumner, also.— General Sumner had invited me to tea, and to pass the Night at his house— I accepted the first part of the invitation; but had engaged to return this Evening to Boston. At General Sumner’s, we met Dr Thomas Gray, and Mr George Whitney Ministers of the Congregational church, at Jamaica-Plains, and a young man by the name of Cleveland— At 7 in the Evening we went to the Jamaica Plains Meeting house, where I delivered the Lecture upon Faith— Mr George Whitney announced another Lecture for next Tuesday Evening.— The Auditory was small, for it poured with rain the whole Evening.— The house was badly lighted— My dinner, and coffee and milk, had affected my voice and my eye-sight, painfully, and I got through my Discourse as I could.— Immediately after which, Mr Curtis’s Carriage took me with my Son back to his house at Boston.

After a storm of ten days duration, floods upon floods of rain, and alternations of chilly and sultry atmosphere, the sky took this day to clear up.— I resumed the writing of an Article upon the quarrel between Great Britain and China, but made slow and very little progress in it. Miss Harriet Welsh came with her nephew Thomas Welsh who gave me a Letter to the Secretary of the Navy soliciting the appointment of an assistant Surgeon in the Navy.— With it there is a certificate from Dr Jacob Bigelow that Thomas Welsh has studied medicine under his tuition one year and upwards; attended Lectures and hospital practice, and borne a good character— The certificate is also signed by D. Humphreys Storer and Edward Reynolds— Withal, a Letter to me soliciting my assistance to obtain the appointment, which I promised— Call at Charles’s Office, where I saw Mr Spooner, and signed powers to Charles to receive dividends on Mercantile Insurance company and Providence Rail-road Stock— Then at Loring’s 122 State-Street, to examine a patent Perryian filter inkstand advertised for sale, but of which except two of the smallest size there were none left— Met Dr W. P. Greenwood there— Call to see Mr. William Foster at his lodgings Mrs Le Kain’s, Summer Street— Not at home—then next door at Sidney Brooks’s— Bell-wire not repaired— At Dr Frothingham’s— He was to have dined with Charles to day; but was confined to his chamber, unwell, and sent an excuse— He appeared to be depressed in Spirits.— Dr Thomas Gray brought me copies of my versions of the 23d and 104th. Psalms, which I had given him, and yesterday requested him to lend me for the use of Mr Lunt: I gave them to him in 1831— He brought also a leaf of a new hymn book, which has been recently compiled, and published by him for the use of his church, and in which 5. Stanzas of my lines on the death of Mrs Ann Hellen’s two infant children, are inserted as a hymn, on the death of an infant.— Dr Gray said that on losing an infant grandchild he had found exquisite comfort in those lines— May I be forgiven, for the joy which this saying gave me. Mr James Haley, President of the Mechanic Apprentices Library Association, came to enquire, if I could deliver a Lecture for them next Monday— I told him I should be under the necessity of leaving the City on that day— He thanked me in the name of the Society for what I had done for them; and I promised to send him Congressional Documents for them, as I had done to their President James L. Curry last year— Edward Brooks, Isaac P. Davis, Samuel K. Lathrop, William Minot, John G. Palfrey, and Josiah Quincy junr. dined with Charles this day—and we had a jovial time from 4 to 9. P.M. "

Mr Samuel Lawrence with Mr Edwards and another person whom I did not know came this morning to enquire if I thought the bill for the more effectual collection of the revenue would be resumed at the approaching session of Congress.— I said I thought it would not; I believed that the policy of the expiring administration would be to diminish rather than increase the revenue— Mr Edwards was well satisfied that the bill as it was returned last Summer from the Senate did not pass, though that was not Mr Lawrence’s impression at that time— I had made an appointment yesterday with Isaac P. Davis to go with him this day at Noon to go, and see an Original Venus of Titian, but I forgot the appointment, and, and paid a long morning visit to Dr William Ellery Channing. We conversed much upon European and foreign politics, but not upon our own. The Doctor thinks that Peace has become such an overruling principle of policy in the popular feeling of all Christian Nations, that there is little or no present danger of War— I did not altogether concur in this opinion, but thought the war fever running very high, especially in France— After I returned to Charles’s, Dr George Parkman, Mr Richard Fletcher, and Louisa C. Smith successively called to see me— Mr Peter C. Brooks, dined with us at Charles’s, and immediately after dinner—Charles brought me out to Quincy— It was pitch dark when we got out, between 6 and 7 O’Clock in the Evening, and he quite unexpectedly to me returned immediately to Boston— I sent John Kirk to Mr Lunt with a request that he would come to me, and he immediately came— I gave him the manuscript copy of the first thirty Psalms of my version; with the two which Dr Gray had lent me, and the leaf from the hymn book containing the lines on the death of an infant and the version of thechapter of Isaiah— I told him that he might select all or any of my psalms for his compilation at his pleasure— And that if he could find it for his own interest to publish the whole book of the Psalms, I asked his acceptance of the copy-right— He thanked me, without expressly accepting my offer; and said that in the manuscript that I had sent him there were passages which would require my revisal— In fact the copies never were collated with my first draughts. He enquired if my version was not all in one measure. Most of it is in the 8 lined Stanza, of 8 syllabled alternate rhymes— But some are in the 8 and 6 line and some in the six line measure— Mr Lunt left me after 9. I could write but little. "

He is the Treasurer of this company, and President of the Providence Rail-road. He introduced me to the Son and daughter of Mr Nathan Appleton, who with another Lady were going to Springfield— At 7. the Cars started— There had been a sharp frost and it was bitter cold— But the Sun rose clear, and the day was fine— The first stop was Framingham.— The second at Westborough, and at each of them was a horse shoe table, with Coffee-grounds, cold tea, and stale gingerbread for such as chose to snatch a breakfast— At the Westborough Station I met Dr Palfrey who was in the Worcester Car—going to see a child he has there— About 10. we stopped about ten minutes, and then proceeded through Brookfield and Warren to Springfield where we arrived at 1/2 past one, and found the worst dinner that has fallen to my lot for many years— At Springfield, a letter was delivered to me from George G.

W. Ellsworth came in, with two or three other Gentlemen, and accompanied me to the presbyterian Church where I delivered the Lecture on Faith— The house was crowded— The pulpit whence I spoke indifferently lighted— My head swimming, after a chilly day, a ride of 120 miles, in Rail-way Cars and Stages, and since breakfast a very scanty meal— But this I believe carried me through— The audience were deeply attentive, and manifested no impatience— Many came up after it was over, and shook hands with me, among whom were judge Williams, and Mr Wadsworth, a Son of Coll. Jeremiah Wadsworth, at whose house I dined in August 1785— Governor Ellsworth returned with me to my lodgings, where after a very light refreshment of a cracker and cheese, and a glass of water, at 1/2 past 9 I retired to bed— "

He introduced me to the Son and daughter of Mr Nathan Appleton, who with another Lady were going to Springfield— At 7. the Cars started— There had been a sharp frost and it was bitter cold— But the Sun rose clear, and the day was fine— The first stop was Framingham.— The second at Westborough, and at each of them was a horse shoe table, with Coffee-grounds, cold tea, and stale gingerbread for such as chose to snatch a breakfast— At the Westborough Station I met Dr Palfrey who was in the Worcester Car—going to see a child he has there— About 10. we stopped about ten minutes, and then proceeded through Brookfield and Warren to Springfield where we arrived at 1/2 past one, and found the worst dinner that has fallen to my lot for many years— At Springfield, a letter was delivered to me from George G. Spencer informing me that he would be ready to receive me at Hartford and recommending to me to lodge at the City Hotel— At Springfield 96 miles from Boston the Rail-way terminates— Thence we came in a Stage 28 Miles to Hartford where we arrived a quarter before 6— In the Stage I had two travelling companions, one from Maine and one from Kentucky—the latter with two ladies.— They tempted me to talk more than Prudence would warrant as often happens to me from the vanity of hearing myself talk— At the City Hotel, I found Mr Joseph Trumbull, the member of Congress, and Mr Spencer who had given me the invitation from the young men’s institute to deliver the Lecture— I sent for a barber, who shaved me at my chamber— Meanwhile Governor W. W. Ellsworth came in, with two or three other Gentlemen, and accompanied me to the presbyterian Church where I delivered the Lecture on Faith— The house was crowded— The pulpit whence I spoke indifferently lighted— My head swimming, after a chilly day, a ride of 120 miles, in Rail-way Cars and Stages, and since breakfast a very scanty meal— But this I believe carried me through— The audience were deeply attentive, and manifested no impatience— Many came up after it was over, and shook hands with me, among whom were judge Williams, and Mr Wadsworth, a Son of Coll. Jeremiah Wadsworth, at whose house I dined in August 1785— Governor Ellsworth returned with me to my lodgings, where after a very light refreshment of a cracker and cheese, and a glass of water, at 1/2 past 9 I retired to bed— "

Mr Baylis and Mr M’Lean Committee of the Brooklyn Society came with a hack came and took me over to the town hall, where I was received with some formality by the Mayor and Aldermen— Met there the Revd. Dr Cox of the Presbyterian Church— After suitable introductions and shaking of hands, we proceeded to the Church, where I delivered to a crowded auditory the Lecture on Faith, which was well received— After another hour of handshaking, I went to the Log Cabin Tippecanoe Ball— Dr. Coxe accompanied me to the door and there took leave. After a short stay there, Mr Baylis and Mr M’Lean accompanied me back to my lodgings at the Astor house, New-York— I received from Dr. Griscom a volume recently published by him upon animal mechanism.

Scarcely able to make minutes of the passage of time. After breakfast sat 2 hours to Mr Marchant—who has taken a good likeness though the portrait is unfinished— He requested of me a line of recommendation to Mr Gallatin whose portrait he is very desirous of taking. He has those of General Jackson, General Harrison, Henry Clay, Mr Ewing of Ohio, Chancellor James Kent and some others— Mrs Marchant and her sister, both comely women came in and joined in conversation while he was at work. At noon I went with Mrs De Wint, and Mr and Mrs Downing to the house of the late Mr Luman Reed whose collection of pictures is still kept by his widow and family. His daughter only was now there and received the Ladies— The pictures are chiefly by Cole and Durand who is now in Europe— There is an excellent portrait of Mr Reed by him; a copy of Carlo Dolce’s Saint Cecilia, and light, humorous fancy pieces on the pannels of the doors. Five large pictures, representing the course of Empire by Cole, are more remarkable for the design than for the execution—much of both are borrowed from Claude— There is one picture of the hunter state—one of the pastoral and agricultural state, for each of which there should be one, and three for the splendour, the decline, and the ruin of a magnificent city— They are pleasing and striking pictures— The first seven Presidents of the United States are ranged in their order—myself and Jackson painted by Durand; and the rest good copies by him from Stuart— Returned to the Astor house and took leave of Mrs De Wint, and Mr and Mrs Downing— The latter return this Evening to Newburg.— Mrs De Wint told me she liked my lecture on Faith, better than the other— And she asked why Charles did not substitute the portrait of my mother engraved from Stuarts Portrait, in the new Edition of the Letters, instead of the other which gives great dissatisfaction— With Mr B. J. Silliman and Ogden Hoffman I went to the City Library, of 25000 volumes. Then to the custom house where Mr Jesse Hoyt the Collector repeated his opinion of the urgent necessity for the Bill to suppress frauds on the revenue, which failed at the last Session of Congress. I had received a Letter from Mr Hoyt requesting to see me. Mr W. Ratcliff called also, but I could barely see him for a moment—from 3. to 5 I went twice in a Cab to N 23 and 25 Washington Square and back without finding Mr Frelinghuysen— Fragment dinner at the Astor house. Mr Shaw a Candidate for the Chaplaincy of the Senate— Hart— To see him at 6. to-morrow Morning. Alexander S. Johnson— Lecture on Faith at the Tabernacle Supper at Sidney Brooks’s chamber, with Mr and Mrs C. A. Davis and Coll William L. Stone— Packed my trunk at Midnight. "

Mercer is one of the most respectable natives of Virginia, and has devoted his life to the internal improvement of the Country, and to the gradual extinction of Slavery in the State— In both of these benevolent and exalted purposes his exertions have been abortive— The Savage and barbarous genius of Slavery has not only baffled them all, but has kindled a flame of popular odium against him, from which he has shrunk into the cashier of a bank at Tallahassee— A noble Spirit doomed to drudge in the mines!

Thessalonians 5.8. it was ascertained to be Hope; and thus opened the general subject of all the encouragements of religion— The discourse was apparently one of a series, upon the several weapons of the whole armour of God— The preacher is a young man moderately eloquent, and his amplification of the virtue and efficacy of Hope as a Christian virtue was instructive and might have been specially useful to me— Particularly his quotation from St. Paul, who had hope, because he had fought the good fight; and had kept the faith— As I was coming out of church Mrs. Middleton spoke and named herself to me. I had not seen her for more than twenty years— She had then several young children, but was young and beautiful— Now she has the remains of beauty blended with the marks of deep affliction upon her face— I should not have recognized her She is English born, and bears an excellent character— I dined with Mr N. Biddle, en famille, with no other addition save judge Hopkinson.— We sat after dinner, settling the Nation till near 8 in the Evening, little satisfied with the result— Hopkinson is snug in port. Content with his office of District judge— Undisturbed by Ambition or fear.— Biddle broods with smiling face and stifled groans over the wreck of splendid, blasted expectations, and ruined hopes. A fair mind—a brilliant genius, a generous temper an honest heart, waylaid and led astray by prosperity—suffering the penalty of scarcely voluntary error—tis piteous to behold.— The judge accompanied me to my lodgings. Dr. Mitchell called; and Mr Connell and Mr Middleton successively came in, and I passed the remainder of the Evening till near midnight with them— Connell has again been unfortunate, and told me he should be under the necessity of applying to General Harrison for an Office— This worthy man’s ups and downs in life have been numerous and lamentable— Mr Middleton resides in Summer at Newport R.I. and as winter approaches takes his flight to the South— "

Lowden, styling himself of Charleston, and as representing the heirs of Commodore Paul Jones, of Revolutionary War renown requesting an interview with me— I answered the Note early this morning, and appointed any time between 10 and 12 to receive him. He came accordingly, with a reprinted copy of Document N. 19. H.R.U.S. 24. Congress 2. Session. a Memorial of Janette Taylor for herself and the other representatives of John Paul Jones, dated 12. December 1836. and then referred to the Committee on Revolutionary Claims.— No report was made by that Committee on the case; but at the special Session in 1837. Mr Caleb Cushing reported from the Committee of Foreign Affairs a Resolution requesting the President to negotiate with the Danish Government in behalf of the claim.— There was no action of the House upon this Resolution— But there was a report of the present Secretary of State John Forsyth upon a Resolution of the Senate of 1. Feby 1836. referring to him the Memorial of Janette Taylor, to that body. Mr Lowden shewed me now a Letter to the Secretary of State, enquiring if he had any further information of the condition of the claim— And he asked my advice whether it would be proper for him to address this Letter to the Secretary— I told him I saw no objection to it; nor to his calling personally on the Secretary of State, and conversing with him on the subject. This evening I received another Letter from Mr Lowden stating the result of his conversation with Mr Forsyth; and sending the printed copy of the house Document N. 19 and a Manuscript copy of Forsyth’s Report to the Senate in 1836. with a request in flattering terms that I would take charge of the advocacy of the claim in the house; and closing with a notice that he should leave the city to-morrow— Mr Lowden appears to be a Scotchman of education and gentlemanly deportment; but he has an impediment in his speech, which makes it painful to converse with him— Mrs W. S. Smith now living with her brother T. B. Johnson was here, and also Mary Cutts; and Mrs Stuart, whom I did not see, but who read to my wife, a Letter from her daughter Mrs Parnell, in Ireland— I called at Mr T. B. Johnson’s house to see him but he was riding out— I then walked to the Capitol, took out from the Library, nine volumes of different works relating to China; found that R. W. Habersham had taken the Seat in the House which had been Mr Abbott Lawrence’s at the last Session, and my name on the table which was Rice Garland’s, and which he had transferred to me at the close of the Session— I bespoke some Stationary, and a packet of Newspapers which were lying for me at the Post-Office. I then came home, and spent the remainder of the day and Evening in reading my Letters and papers, and in Auber’s China, published in 1834. and in journalizing till 10. P.M. "

Morning visits from Dr Sewall, and from Mr Hodgson, who, since the close of the last Session of Congress has been to Europe as a bearer of despatches, and has just returned, in the British Queen, which arrived at New-York last Saturday. Mr Hodgson carried out to Berlin a Treaty negotiated there by Mr Wheaton, with the Minister of the king of Hanover—between the United States, and Hanover— It was ratified by and with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States at their last Session. The Treaty was sent by Mr Hodgson for exchange of ratifications, but it was drawn up in the English and French Languages, and his Hanoverian Majesty declines exchanging the ratifications, unless upon an agreement that the French text shall be declared the original Treaty— Mr Hodgson returns therefore, without the Hanoverian Ratification— I walked to the Capitol and called at the Clerk’s Office— The Documents and Journals of the last Session have not yet been received from the Bookbinders. I exchanged an Inkstand The Books which I took yesterday out from the Library are 1. Henry Ellis’s journal of the proceedings of Lord Amherst’s embassy to China in 1816. An Edition published at Philadelphia in 1818. 2. Notices relating to China, by Sir George Thomas Staunton Bart. published in 1822 3. British Relations with the Empire of China in 1832, An anonymous pamphlet. 4. China—by Peter Auber. 1834. 5. The Fan-Qui in China in 1836–7. by Toogood Downing, in 3. Volumes. 1838. 6. China opened—by the Revd. Charles Gutzlaff—revised by the Revd. Andrew Reed D.D. 2. Volumes 1838.— All these books are necessary to enable me to do any thing like justice to the Article on the quarrel between Great-Britain and China, which I am preparing for Dr Palfrey, and I brought with me four small volumes of the Library of entertaining knowledge—entitled the Chinese—by John Francis Davis—published in 1837— After writing as long as I was able, I devoted this evening to reading Ellis’s journal of the proceedings of Lord Amherst’s embassy in 1816, which was much more cavalierly treated than that of Lord Macartney in 1793— Many of the same formalities were indeed observed, but with Lord Amherst, the whole negotiation was confined to the discussion whether the Embassador would or would not perform the prostration of the Ko-Tou, and as soon as it was found that he would not he was turned off without being admitted to the presence of the Emperor— It is plain that the moment that pretension shall be broken down, China will be open to foreign commerce and foreign travel— The Chinese Mandarins maintained that Lord Macartney did perform the Ko-Tou before the Emperor Kien Long; and they told Lord Amherst that if he would perform the ceremony he might make what report of it to his Government he pleased!— "

Thursday—  Mr Ousely the gardener at the President’s house came this morning to confide to me his grievances and his apprehensions— Nolan, the Commissioner of the Public buildings employs a gardener at the Capitol where there is nothing to do, but to keep the grounds clean and gives him a Salary of 1200 dollars a year—a job for a partizan— The man’s name is Mar— While Ousely himself, an excellent gardener and man, who raises all the vegetables and much fruit for the Presidents house, is allowed only 450 dollars a year, and a workman to assist him less than six weeks of the time— Ousely thinks it probable that Mar will be dismissed, and that the two gardeners should be placed on an equal footing; and the Salary equally divided between them— Long morning visit from Coll. Thomas, but he had now nothing new to tell. I paid a morning visit to the President— Met in the large entry below coming out as I went in Mr Levi Woodbury, the Secretary of the Treasury, with a Lady whom he named as Mrs Hale of Boston— I found with the President, in his cabinet, his Son Abram and Mr Joel R. Poinsett, Secretary of War. Our conversation was altogether upon European Affairs, chiefly of France, which the President thinks in a dilemma, between external war, and internal revolution. My next call was upon Mr James K. Paulding, Secretary of the Navy, to whom I made the application in behalf of Thomas Welsh, for the appointment of Surgeon’s mate in the Navy. Mr Paulding said his name would be placed on the register, and that he would have to undergo an examination— I went thence to Mr T. B. Johnson’s and sat half an hour with him. He has had since we left the City last July a very severe paralytic attack, and his life hangs upon the most attenuated of Spider’s threads— The physicians who have attended him assure his Sisters that his mental faculties are not impaired, which is scarcely credible; but he has sufficiently the use of his limbs to walk about his chamber and to write his name— I gave him on my Son’s account and at his request a check for 50 dollars, of which he said he would acknowledge the receipt in a Letter to Charles— Thence on a visit to the General Post-Office, I requested of Mr John M. Niles the Postmaster General, a copy of the Petition upon which Luther Angier was removed from the Office of Postmaster at Medford— I had received a Letter from Mr John Angier, asking me to apply for this copy— Mr Niles shewed me the petition, signed by nine persons, but declined furnishing a copy of it, which he said was contrary to a long standing rule of the office— While I was out Mr Frye was here, and I received Evening visits from Mr Albion K. Parris, my next door neighbour and Tenant; with his father—from W. P. Elliot a Clerk in the Office of the Commissioner of Pensions; and from the Revd. Mr Hawley. Elliot shewed me a notification from the Commissioner of Pensions J. L Edwards that his services would be no longer needed after next February. "

Mr M’Cormick is a native of Ireland; a Clergyman of the Episcopal Church, and when I first came to Washington as a member of the Senate in 1803. was settled as Minister of a small, poor church at the Navy-Yard— On the 1st. of January 1818 I appointed him a Clerk in the Department of State; an Office which he yet holds, having been promoted from a Salary of 1000 to one of 1450 dollars a year. He remembers me, and at the commencement of a Session of Congress visits me when he can do it without danger.— Mr Harris is a young man, President of the Mercantile Library Association at Baltimore. He brought me a Letter from David Hoffman, earnestly urging me to deliver one of my Lectures, before that institution next Tuesday Evening; and I promised if no accident before that time should intervene to prevent me, that I would—and that in the event of such accident I would give notice of it to Mr Harris, if there should be time. Morning visit from Dr Thomas— I asked him what was the true condition of Mr T. B. Johnsons health and mind— He said he was hypochondriac and had no other disease— None for which a physician could prescribe— He was whimsical, and flighty, but not of unsound mind— I called on the Secretary of the Treasury at the Department, and conversed with him concerning the Letter I had received from Jesse Hoyt the Collector at New-York and my interview with him at the Custom house there relating to the Bill for suppressing frauds on the revenue, which was lost at the last Session of Congress. Mr Woodbury thought the Bill, which had first passed the house of more importance now, than the superfetation from the Senate.— He said he should be prepared to report upon a revisal of the Tariff, if Congress should call upon him for it; but he should not volunteer the service. I had received a Letter from Mr Thomas Loring of Hingham, about a Register for the Schooner Amistad, purchased at auction at New London, under a decree of the District Court, sold for Salvage.— Mr Woodbury said he had received a Letter on the same subject this day, and would have enquiry concerning it made: upon which I agreed to call again to-morrow I said something concerning the case of the Amistad Negroes, and that I proposed to see the Attorney General, respecting them— Miss Cutts came this afternoon and took tea here; and in the Evening came to escort her home— Mr Parris the Comptroller was also here with Mr Wood, the Minister of the Presbyterian church Among the Letters which I received this day was one from John P. Bigelow Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enclosing my certificate of election as a member of the 27th. Congress, and a list of all the votes cast in the 12th.

My old Piedmontese man servant Giusta, whom I picked up, at Amsterdam in June 1814. a stray deserter from Napoleon’s army in his disastrous Russian campaign, who served me faithfully till the 3d. of March 1829. when I left him as steward of the President’s house to my successor there, Andrew Jackson, called to see me this morning.— Antoine’s life with a little embroidery from the hand of an imaginative novelist, would make an amusing and instructive tale— He married at our house in 1818 an English girl who from our kitchen at Ealing came over with us to this country, and has been to him an excellent wife. Tis pity they have never had a child— They lived two or three years with President Jackson; but could not abide his negro slaves and his savage temper— They left him and kept five or six years a small oyster and coffee house, in which he amassed a fund sufficient for them to live comfortably on its income—he purchased a small lot and tenement upon which they live, and where like Diocletian he cultivates cabbages, and lettuce, and celery. He went home two years ago to visit his relations and was gone more than a year.— He found them poor and miserable, and his brother ruined by habits of intemperance— Good humoured and social, Antoine had acquired in this Country a habit of free speaking which on his return home soon brought him under the surveillance of the police— He came back and brought one of his nephews with him But he casts lingering looks towards the natale solum and intends to dispose of all his property here, and go back to spend his last days in the land of his birth.  Mrs Pinkney is the widow of the second William Pinkney, a lost Pleiad— She came to solicit my influence to obtain a subordinate Clerkship in the House of Representatives, for her eldest Son John Sperry, 18 years of age— A younger son, 15 years old is already a midshipman in the Navy as a constructive Tennessean by the adoption of Mr Foster late a Senator from that State— I called again on the Secretary of the Treasury. The comptroller had answered Mr Loring’s letter, and confirmed by implication the refusal of the Collector at New-London to issue papers for the purchaser of the Amistad. Mr Woodbury said that he would make the collector decide the question directly and send the decision to me on Monday. He said the interest on the Arkansas bonds for the Smithsonian fund, had been regularly and punctually paid— I called twice at the Office of the Attorney General, but he was not there— At the Bank of the Metropolis where I received a balance of 3. dollars 20 cents which has been lying there upwards of two years. At the U.S. branch Bank, Mr Richard Smith told me that he had concluded to act as Executor of Mrs Hay’s Will. My wife spent this Evening with her brother Mary with Mrs Talbot, and Mary-Louisa at a party at General Jesup’s. "

                "text": "29. IV. Sunday.  At the second Presbyterian Church in the morning I heard a Mr Moore, whose text was from John 11.38 [“]Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself cometh to the grave— It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.” The first clause of the verse—the argument of the preacher was humanitarian— That Jesus was a perfect man subject to all the sinless infirmities of human nature— The argument of his divinity was not encountered; but was taken for granted— A much knottier point— That he lived and suffered and died as a man can hardly be questioned by any one who believes that he ever existed— His superhuman nature so often asserted by himself—his express declaration—before Abraham was I am—the very name by which God commanded Moses to call him— The affirmation of St. Paul that by him, God made the world, his continual assumption of the two characters, son of God and Son of Man compel me to believe that he was more than man— I cannot mythologize his miracles—and least of all that of his resurrection from the dead. His gospel is a standing miracle which I cannot controvert—his divinity is a mystery which I cannot believe, and which I see no necessity for believing; any more than the eternity of future punishments. I was not much pleased with Mr Moore’s discourse; which was full of dark and gloomy imagery, without urging any profitable doctrine or exciting any cheerful sentiment— The congregation is yet very thin— The seceders claim the church and I have an unanswered Letter from then demanding my concurrence with or acquiescence in their claim— But they hold their meetings as yet, at what is called the Medical College.— The secession as I understand was occasioned by the engagement of Mr Wood a New-England Congregationalist, as preacher in this presbyterian Church— After dinner at St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley read the Evening service for the first Sunday in Advent, and a Mr Berry a native of the Island of Jamaica, educated at the University of Cambridge in England preached from Psalm 19.6. “His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.” The Sermon began with a superficial analysis of the two parts of this most beautiful Psalm, between which he did not appear to understand the admirable connection— There was no want of ingenuity or of handsome composition in the discourse; but what it was after I could not discover, unless it was to reprobate the practice of hanging up paintings on religious subjects in churches—a doctrine for which there might be some occasion in England but for which there can be none here.— The Evening service now begins here at half past 3— Mr. Berry did not finish till after Sunset, and he had much difficulty in reading the last pages of his Sermon— He just made out to announce four Stanzas of a hymn; but the choir could see to sing only two of them— Mrs Frye took tea here. My wife and Mary went home with her, and spent the Evening there— "

Dr Toule, the husband of the Lady who some three years ago, painted my portrait, called on me this morning with a request that I would give her another sitting as she had been taken sick and left the picture unfinished before— I promised to visit her at her residence next Thursday before noon— Dr Todson came to say that he has a claim for compensation, for a translation of the Danish Tariff made by him for the Department of State, but for which the Secretary Mr Forsyth had no fund to pay him. He proposed to petition Congress for it, and asked my advice whether to present it, at the approaching Session, or to wait for the next Congress. I said he had better offer it now; not with an expectation of obtaining any thing at this short Session—but the claim may gain some advancement upon the business of the next Congress.— Dr Todson has been two years Consul of the United States at Altena, but found it would not give him bread— He needs some small office for subsistence, and has talents and learning which may be usefully employed. Mr Hawley came, and introduced Mr Berry, the gentleman, who assisted him in his official services yesterday— Mr Berry said he had heard me deliver the Lecture upon Faith at the Tabernacle in New-York, and he thought there were four thousand persons present— I doubt if the building will hold three thousand— Miss Cutts was also here; and Mr Henry the Member of the House of Representatives, from Beaver and Mercer Counties, Pennsylvania;—with Mrs. Henry; and their little daughter— I went to the Office of the Attorney General, Gilpin; then to his house, and again to his Office where at last I found him— The Commissioner of the Land-Office Whitcomb was with him. I spoke to him of the case of the Negroes of the Amistad, to come before the Supreme Court of the United States at their Session next January, on appeal, by the U.S. District Attorney from the decision of the District and Circuit U.S. Courts in Connecticut— Mr Gilpin had received a Letter from Mr Baldwin requesting that the case may be taken up, the first week of the Courts sitting, but thought there would be difficulty in taking it up out of its turn— I desired Mr Gilpin to submit to the consideration of the President the expedient of having the case dismissed by consent, without argument; for which I urged obvious reasons, and which he said would deserve serious consideration— I had called on the Secretary of State Forsyth; and had much conversation with him upon China, and New Zealand, and the North-eastern boundary— Mr Fendall was here this Evening; and Mr D. C. Harris from Baltimore, who comes to accompany me to that City to-morrow "

Breakfasted at the Ladies ordinary, where there were few boarders— Visits immediately after from Messrs. Ridgely and Griffith as a Committee from the Temperance Society, to request me to deliver an address to that association; which I was obliged to decline, as at present impracticable; and as certain to be so during the approaching Session of Congress— But after its close, I promised either to deliver such an address, or to give them notice that it will not be in my power. Mr D. C. Harris came also to enquire how I was this morning. I returned with a card the card visit of Mr Reverdy Johnson, and in person the card visit of Coll. B. C. Howard. Much conversation with him, upon the North-eastern boundary question, upon which he said he proposed to deliver a Lecture before the Mercantile Library Association— He shewed me Kitchin’s Atlas of Maps in which there are two published by Laurie and Whittle 12. May 1794 one of which marked the boundary as now claimed by the British Government, and the other as claimed by the U.S. he said he had supposed until he saw these maps that the present British claim was a recent pretension; and he could not now account for the fact that these two map were published by the same persons on the same day.— Returning from Coll. Howard’s I went to the column at the end of North Charles street erected to George Washington by the State of Maryland.— There is a cubic basement, within which is a man who receives 12 1/2 cents for the admission of a visitor, and furnishes him with a lantern to ascend the winding stairs between the outer and inner column— There are 28 steps of ascent to the top of the basement, and 200. thence to the top of the shaft and of the entablature over it— At every 25th. step the stepping stone is wider than the rest to afford a resting station—over the entablature is a cap, cylindrical and round top’d over which stands a colossal statue of Washington in a Roman toga, with a roll in his extended right hand meant for the constitution— There is also a Statue of him in a corner of the basement below, and a bust in a Niche, copied from that of Ceracchi— The whole is in elegant taste and the front of the column forms a beautiful object to the eye, at different distances throughout the whole length of Charles Street. After returning to Barnum’s, I met with Lieutt. Wayne, and had visits from Mr George H. Newman and his Son— Dined at 4. O’ Clock with Mr Robert Gilmor, and had a glance at his fine collection of pictures, and Greenough’s Statue of Medora company 9 and Mr Gilmor, a round table; excellent dinner delicious wines and a jovial company— After dinner Mr Granger came in— Mr Reverdy Johnson took me home with him to an oyster supper and just before midnight I returned to the Hotel.

Mayer, Hoffman and Boyd visitors while I was out— Mr David Hoffman, and Mr Kerr, were two of the Electors of President, and Vice-President of the United States, for the State of Maryland— Yesterday was the day upon which the electors of the 26. States met at the Seats of their respective Governments, to vote for those two officers to serve for four years commencing on the 4th. of March 1841— The Electors for the State of Maryland met at Annapolis and gave ten votes, the number to which the State is entitled, for William Henry Harrison of Ohio as President, and John Tyler of Virginia as Vice-President— Mr Kerr and Mr Jenifer called this morning just as I was about leaving Barnum’s to return to Washington— Mr J. M. Harris came and introduced several of the Directors of the Mercantile Library Association, whose names I was unable to retain—except that of Mr James S. Waters who accompanied me on my return— On calling for my Bill at Barnum’s I was told it was paid— Mr Harris took me in a hack to the Railway depot— The train started at 9 A.M. and at half past 11. we alighted at Washington; and Mr Waters accompanied me in a hack to the door of my house— He dined with us at 3. and after dinner left us to go to Alexandria— Mr Meredith urged me very warmly to remain at Baltimore and dine with him this day; but I had already indulged myself too much with the day of entertainment, by Mr Gilmor and Mr Reverdy Johnson— The outward marks of respect which I have received on the delivery of these Lectures for the last five weeks, are too flattering, and more than my honest nature can endure— It augurs some deep humiliation awaiting to teach me in the last stage of my existence on earth, what I am, and the real estimation in which I am held by the very small portion of my fellow creatures who know or care any thing about me— I found on my table at home Letters calling me to new duties, and severe and trying labours, for which I ask for aid. A meek and quiet but genial spirit— I walked to the capitol hill, and gave a sitting of nearly an hour to Mrs Towle.— Her portrait of me painted in October 1837 is hideous. She says she was taken ill at that time—was unable to finish my portrait or any other, and has scarcely painted half a dozen since.— It were well if she knew that the word applicable to all her works is not paint, but daub.— The poor woman said she had met with domestic affliction since my former sittings, by losing a little boy her Son; a calamity in which I deeply sympathised with her— I promised her another sitting next Monday or Tuesday. I gave my Grand daughter Mary-Louisa, a silver Can cup, which I purchased for her yesterday, her birthday. She is twelve years old. "

                "text": "3. VI. Thursday.  On returning to the Hotel last Night, I found on my table the names of Messrs. Mayer, Hoffman and Boyd visitors while I was out— Mr David Hoffman, and Mr Kerr, were two of the Electors of President, and Vice-President of the United States, for the State of Maryland— Yesterday was the day upon which the electors of the 26. States met at the Seats of their respective Governments, to vote for those two officers to serve for four years commencing on the 4th. of March 1841— The Electors for the State of Maryland met at Annapolis and gave ten votes, the number to which the State is entitled, for William Henry Harrison of Ohio as President, and John Tyler of Virginia as Vice-President— Mr Kerr and Mr Jenifer called this morning just as I was about leaving Barnum’s to return to Washington— Mr J. M. Harris came and introduced several of the Directors of the Mercantile Library Association, whose names I was unable to retain—except that of Mr James S. Waters who accompanied me on my return— On calling for my Bill at Barnum’s I was told it was paid— Mr Harris took me in a hack to the Railway depot— The train started at 9 A.M. and at half past 11. we alighted at Washington; and Mr Waters accompanied me in a hack to the door of my house— He dined with us at 3. and after dinner left us to go to Alexandria— Mr Meredith urged me very warmly to remain at Baltimore and dine with him this day; but I had already indulged myself too much with the day of entertainment, by Mr Gilmor and Mr Reverdy Johnson— The outward marks of respect which I have received on the delivery of these Lectures for the last five weeks, are too flattering, and more than my honest nature can endure— It augurs some deep humiliation awaiting to teach me in the last stage of my existence on earth, what I am, and the real estimation in which I am held by the very small portion of my fellow creatures who know or care any thing about me— I found on my table at home Letters calling me to new duties, and severe and trying labours, for which I ask for aid. A meek and quiet but genial spirit— I walked to the capitol hill, and gave a sitting of nearly an hour to Mrs Towle.— Her portrait of me painted in October 1837 is hideous. She says she was taken ill at that time—was unable to finish my portrait or any other, and has scarcely painted half a dozen since.— It were well if she knew that the word applicable to all her works is not paint, but daub.— The poor woman said she had met with domestic affliction since my former sittings, by losing a little boy her Son; a calamity in which I deeply sympathised with her— I promised her another sitting next Monday or Tuesday. I gave my Grand daughter Mary-Louisa, a silver Can cup, which I purchased for her yesterday, her birthday. She is twelve years old. "

Mutual gratulation at the downfall of the Jackson-Van Buren Administration is the universal theme of conversation— One can scarcely imagine the degree of detestation in which they are both held— No one knows what is to come— In four years from this time the successor may be equally detested. He is not the choice of three fourths of those who have elected him— His present popularity is all artificial— There is little confidence in his talents or his firmness— If he is not found time-serving, demagogical, unsteady and western-sectional, he will more than satisfy my present expectations.— Jackson’s Administration commenced with fairer prospects and an easier career before him, than had ever before been presented to any President of the United States— His personal popularity founded exclusively upon the battle of New-Orleans, drove him through his double-term and enabled him to palm upon this Nation the Sycophant, who declared it glory enough to have served under such a chief for his Successor. Both the men have been for twelve years the tools of Amos Kendall the ruling mind of their dominion— Their edifice has crumbled into ruin by the mere force of gravitation, and the wretchedness of their cement— But what is to come? No halcyon days— One set of unsound principles for another— One man in leading strings for another— Harrison comes in upon a hurricane. God grant he may not go out upon a reck!— Perhaps these gloomy reflections are chilled by the fall of snow, which began before noon, and continued through the day without storming. It confined me to the house till 5. P.M. when I went and dined with Mr Seaton the Mayor of the City— A diplomatic dinner, with Messrs Bacourt, Bodisco, Mareschal, Martini, Serruys, Hulsemann, Steckel, and one or two others.— Also Mr Gales,Bradley, Richard S. Coxe, Columbus Munro—Mrs Seaton, Miss Seaton and Miss Scott—not to forgetSmith the Register of the Treasury. After dinner Mr Coxe entertained me with an account of his antient relations with John C. Calhoun, and of Calhoun’s solicitude at the time of my election as President, lest I should be driven by those around me, into the absurd and detestable doctrine, as he then called it of State rights.— I have heard no person speak with so much bitterness of the expiring administration as Mr Coxe— There was a whist party in the Evening, but without taking part in it I came home before 9. I had wasted the day, in looking over the documents relating to the Amistad negro case, and Ellis’s journal of the proceedings of Lord Amhersts Embassy to China. "

Morning visit, from Mr Boyd, a young clergyman from Portland, Maine, who was last winter a candidate for the chaplaincy of the house, and comes doubtless with the same aspiration now— I called at the Department of State, but the Secretary, Forsyth was indisposed, at his house. I left with Mr Derrick, the clerk having charge of the Diplomatic bureau, a letter which I had received containing a vote, of the Massachusetts historical Society at their last October meeting, charging a Committee of 3 members of whom I am one, to ascertain if certain documents relating to the Northeastern boundary of the United States, borrowed from the historical Society half a century ago, by Egbert Benson, one of the Commissioners of the United States for ascertaining the St. Croix river, so denominated in the Treaties of Peace of 1782 and 1783. are not among the papers on file in the Department; and if they are, to reclaim them; as well as any other papers belonging to the Society which may be in the Department— Derrick promised to make the search— I left also with Mr Martin the Chief Clerk a copy of the call which I propose to move in the house for documents relating to the origin and present state of our relations with China, political and commercial. Mr Martin gave me a copy of the House Document of the House N. 119. of the last Session, called at the motion of Caleb Cushing on the 7th. of February last— I called next on the Secretary of the Treasury with a Letter from the first Comptroller’s Office, signed J. N. Burke acting Comptroller’s Office and assigning as a reason for the refusal of the Collector at New-London to issue American papers to the purchaser of the Schooner Amistad, sold by the U.S. Marshal under a decree of the judge of the U.S. District Court in Connecticut, that there was an appeal from the Decree of the judge, and that it had not been usual to issue papers upon an interlocutory or other than final decree. I requested that this opinion from the comptroller’s Office might be reconsidered; observing that the decree of the District Court operated in rem— That the sale by the Marshal under that decree was the act of the Law, not at all affecting the right of the party appealing from the decree of salvage, but done for the benefit of all the parties to save the perishable article for him to whom it should finally adjudged to belong— That the refusal of the papers would invalidate the sale by the Marshal and the decree of the judge, and give the purchaser a just claim of damages against the Government itself, whose officers in the two departments would thus counteract one another— If the decision of the Secretary should adhere to this view from the Comptroller’s office I should be under the necessity of commencing a correspondence with the District judge concerning his decree— Mr Woodbury said he would call on the Comptroller for a statement of the case; and take and report to me the opinion of the Attorney General, on the Law "

Sunday.—  Snow—  I called yesterday at the Office of the Attorney General Gilpin; but he was not there, nor expected to be there, for the day— I then came home and debarred from writing by the shivering cold of an atmosphere of attenuated snow wasted the remainder of the day in alternate desultory reading upon China, and dosing; with faculties absolutely torpid— Finished the cursory reading of Ellis’s journal of the proceedings of Lord Amherst’s embassy in 1816— Read sundry short Articles of Sir George T. Staunton’s Miscellaneous notices relating to China published in 1822 and skimmed over the Document 119. of the last Session of Congress— The Snow continued, with occasional intermissions, all day yesterday, all last Night and this day, the whole day long— I have no recollection of a snow storm of three days duration before— There has been however no gale, and very little drifting of the Snow. About 18 inches deep of snow upon a level has fallen. I rode to the Presbyterian Church and found it closed, and the doors blocked up with snow. I came home, and occupied the remainder of the day chiefly in reading. Dr George W. Doane, bishop of New-Jersey, was present at the delivery of my Lecture upon Faith, at the Tabernacle in New-York— Since my arrival here I have received from him a pamphlet entitled “looking unto Jesus” containing a Sermon preached by him at St. Mary’s church, Burlington New-Jersey on the occasion of the death of Revd, Benjamin Davis Winslow; his assistant as Rector of that Church— An address to the Congregation of that Church, before the Administration of the Communion, on Advent Sunday 1839. on the same subject; and sundry obituary notices of Mr Davis, who died on the 21st. of November 1839. of a consumption at the age of 24— Born at Boston in February 1815. a graduate of Harvard University in 1835 he perished almost in the blossom, but his virtues have been well commemorated in these tributes of his patron, relative and friend to his worth— His life was a bright example of religious faith and fervent zeal— His talents were highly respectable, and there are cited two or three of his poetical effusions in this pamphlet, at once melancholy and pleasing— I often think when reflecting upon the depravity of human Nature, what multitudes there are of persons unknown to fame, of blameless life and unsullied virtue in the world; and how unjust it is to pass sentence of universal condemnation upon mankind, without making allowance for all that is good among them.— In all Christian Countries, there is an immense account of practical virtue, always in operation though never made known to the world— I wrote a short Letter to Bishop Doane thanking him for the pamphlet; and then recurred again to the Books brought from the Library of Congress, relating to China— Among these, the Fan-qui in China, by C. Toogood Downing, published in 1838 is one of the most amusing— It is an account of the manners and customs—the condition of domestic life in that country, more particular than I have found elsewhere—in three duodecimo volumes— I read several chapters of it myself, and Mary Louisa read to us two chapters this Evening after tea— I attempted to write further in my Article upon China, but the snowy atmosphere chilled my fingers.

It was broad daylight when I rose— The sky had cleared away cold, and I lay abed shrinking from the task of pinching my feet with cold water, and of making a wood fire in a chilly chamber, which after all I was obliged to perform, having in the meantime lost the two best hours of the day for work. This day commenced the second Session of the 26th. Congress— The heavy fall of snow compelled me to ride to the Capitol and a quarter before 12. I took my seat, being that which Rice Garland transferred to me the morning after the close of the last Session. Precisely at Noon, the Speaker Robert M. T. Hunter took the chair and the names of the members were called over by States. 95 answered to the call and 7 new members were presented and sworn by the Speaker, among whom was Robert C. Winthrop from Boston who takes the place of Abbott Lawrence resigned— He and Governor Lincoln have been ever since last Friday afternoon at 3. O’Clock coming from Philadelphia, and reached this City only at 4. O’Clock this Morning.— The snow-storm has been unparalleled— The Speaker immediately adjourned the house at the motion of Lewis Williams. The Delegates from the Territories were not called, but Downing of Florida, and Dodge of Ioway were present and 6 members came in after the adjournment— In the Senate only 16. members appeared, and neither the Vice-President, R. M. Johnson, nor the President pro Tem, W. R. King was among them. I rode home— Miss Cutts shortly after came in; and then T. B. J. Frye, who dined with us— He was going to attend a meeting of the National Institute for the promotion of Science, of which he told me he had been elected a member, and before which his father told me a paper by him on the zoology and ornithology of this district, was the first ever read before the Society. Mr Gilpin the Attorney General, left a card, with word that he would call again. My neighbour Mr A. K. Parris called with Mr Chickering a Clergyman of Portland Maine, travelling South for his health and perhaps with a mission— He enquired if I had been acquainted with his grandfather, sometime Minister of the Congregational church at Dedham. I did not know him— He is proposing to go to Marseilles in France, where a number of Americans and English are about to open a Protestant Church, of which they have invited him to be the pastor.— He asked some questions about the opinion that I gave at New-York in the Lecture upon Faith at the Tabernacle; that Louis Philippe has no title to the crown of France— Mr Bisbee announced himself as an Agent for the American Association of Literature and Science, at New-York, of which he said I had at their last meeting been elected an honorary member— He enquired if I accepted this election, and I said I should be glad to receive a regular written communication of it— Mr Frye was here and mentioned to me a fresh difficulty with regard to the liberation of William S. Smith— My wife wrote about it to Mrs Smith. "

Rode to the Capitol— The Speaker took the Chair at Noon; and the roll was called over of members who had not answered— Fifty additional members now answered to their names— A Message was sent to the Senate, to inform them that a Quorum of the house were assembled, and ready to proceed to business; and an order passed for the appointment of a Committee, to be joined by a Committee on the part of the Senate, to wait on the President of the United States and inform him that a Quorum of both houses are assembled and ready to receive any communication that he may be pleased to make to them. Mr Taliaferro and Mr Cave Johnson were appointed the Committee on the part of the house. I gave notice of my purpose to offer to-morrow a Resolution that the standing role of the house, numbered 21. adopted on the 28th. of January last be rescinded— It is the rule that abolition petitions shall not be received or in any manner entertained by the house.— No other business was transacted— The Senate did not form a Quorum, five additional members only to those present yesterday having appeared one of whom was the President pro tem. W. R. King.— The house adjourned about half past 12. Of the members who came in this day John Sergeant, W. B. Calhoun, Millard Filmore and Daniel D. Barnard who travelled with his wife and two children, left Philadelphia on Saturday morning in the Cars, and at 9. O’Clock that evening found themselves 23 miles from Baltimore, in the middle of the road with the snow falling and the storm howling around them; and unable equally to proceed or to recede— There of eighty passengers in the train, thirty of whom were women, the greater number remained the whole night of Saturday; the whole day and Night of Sunday, and Monday till near noon; when fresh engines came and took them up, and brought them last night into Baltimore. A small part of their company found a refuge in two or three hovels, near the place where they were arrested, but fared worse than those who adhered to the Cars— These made themselves comfortable by shutting out the tempest, keeping up good fires, and foraging successfully round the neighbourhood, for a supply of provisions— Sergeant says there was in all this not much of hardship— The passengers from the South brought an account that Waddy Thompson just beyond Petersburg in Virginia, was knocked down between the two rails, and the whole train of five cars, engine and all passed over his body without hurting him much, or perhaps at all. He did not come on however in the cars— After the adjournment of the house, I walked over and gave a sitting of two hours, to Mrs Towle, during which once or twice I fell asleep— This infirmity of old age frequently happens to me, to mortify my pride, and to remind me how near I am to the caducity of the last Scene of all. I promised Mrs Towle to give her another sitting—if possible next Monday— I walked home. My wife and Mary-Louisa, are both indisposed and kept their chambers. I paid an evening visit to my neighbour Mr Parris, whose numerous family I found engaged in a Concert of church music which they suspended while I was there, and resumed when I left them. Mr Chickering and Mr Fillebrown were of the party—Mr Parris’s four daughters—his Son, and Son’s wife— Also Mrs Parris. "

It was accordingly received and read—ready printed for the Senate— Atherton of New Hampshire moved that the Message should be referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—and that 15000 copies of it with the documents, and 5000 copies without the documents be printed for the use of the members of the house, which was carried— I had offered my resolution to rescind the 21st. standing rule of the house— Jenifer moved to lay it on the table Lewis Williams that it be postponed— I said I was willing to take the question immediately without debate— I offered the Resolution, at the earliest possible moment for two reasons—first because the commencement of the Session is the time for receiving petitions—and secondly because so far as the discharge of my duty was concerned I would not suffer that rule to stand one hour as the Law of the house— Linn Banks moved that it should be laid on the table— I said that if the house did not choose to take the vote directly on the resolution, I should prefer next the question of laying on the table, because it could then be called up at any time— I asked for the yeas and nays and they were 82 to 58—all the South, and Northern serviles voting in the affirmative— The house adjourned about 3.— I took out from the library of Congress, Barrow’s travels in China—as private Secretary of Lord Macartney. Van Braam’s account of the embassy from the Dutch East-India company to China in 1794 and 5. translated from the French of Moreau de Saint Mery; and Timkowski’s travels with the Russian Embassy to China in 1820 and 21. Walking homewards from the Capitol, Mr Burch took me up in a Sleigh; till I stopped at the Franklin insurance company’s office, and received a check on the Patriotic bank for a dividend—after which I walked home. My nephew William S. Smith was this day liberated after nearly two years of confinement and came with his wife to my house. She has been several months residing with her brother Mr Thomas B. Johnson— Miss Cutts spent the Evening here, and her father came and escorted her home. Mr Robert Greenhow, the Translator of the Department of State, came, and complained that he had been unjustly charged with making a false translation in the document N 185 of the house documents of the last Session in the case of the Africans captured in the Amistad— He shewed me the charges in the Letter of judge Jay, and said that judge Jay was mistaken in supposing the word negros to have been interpolated in the Spanish certificate; and that the word sound in the printed document was not in the manuscript translation made by him and transmitted to the house— Mr Greenhow, requested me to see that the matter should be understood by the house to exonerate him.

                "text": "10. V:30 Thursday.  I went to the Capitol an hour before the meeting of the house this morning, calling at Lewis Johnson shop which is removed to East of Gadsby’s—where I left a Letter to him from John Otis— From the Clerk’s Office of the house I sent into the Senate chamber a Letter from Dr Joshua Bates to judge Haight— I examined the manuscript document of the last session N. 185. and upon comparing it, with the printed document, found as Mr Greenhow had stated to me last evening that in the manuscript the word Ladino is inserted in the translations of both the permits to ship the negroes, for which in the printed document the word sound is substituted— At the meeting of the house Stanly moved to reconsider the vote for printing 15000 copies of the President’s Message with the Documents—upon which the vote by yeas and nays was 89 to 90. I then moved that a select Committee of five members be appointed to ascertain and report to the house, whether the house document of the last Session N. 185 has been falsified; and if so, by whom the falsification was made; with liberty to send for person and papers— I stated the fact of the difference between the manuscript and the printed document—then read the note, on the false translation of the word ladino in the reprint of the document at New-York and the censure upon it in judge William Jay’s Letter of 20. October last to Lewis Tappan, published in the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Reporter N. 8 and 9.— No answer was made to me, and no objection to adoption of the Resolution, but when the Speaker put the question, several voices in the negative were heard—a division was called and the vote stood 87 to 46. there were of course upwards of 40 who did not vote.— An order passed for the appointment of the standing Committees; and Tillinghast offered a very long resolution calling upon the Secretary of the Treasury for information respecting the execution of the sub treasury law; which after some discussion was rejected by the house. The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury upon the finances was received—and referred to the Committee of Ways and Means and 5000 extra copies were ordered to be printed. A Message from the President was received recommending an immediate appropriation of 151352 dollars 39 cents for the Navy Pension fund to meet payments which will become due on the 1st. of January. Several other Resolutions were offered, and the house adjourned over to Monday— As I was returning home, I met in the Avenue Mr Greenhow, who enquired if I had examined the document N. 185 in manuscript— I told him that I had—and found it as he had said— And that I had offered a Resolution to ascertain by whom the fraud has been committed— And that I had taken care to exonerate him entirely from all blame in the matter— I met at my door a man named J. J. Smith who has a claim for an increase of pension as an old Soldier presented by Mr Naylor at the last Session, for which he solicited my aid, which he will have— A young man named Charles Abbot, came to request me to deliver a Lecture here, which I shall take into consideration. Mr Barnard sent me his Lecture on the Morals of Politics which I read to my wife. "

                "text": "11. VI:30. Friday  Mild and fair day. The Snow gradually melting away— I called this morning on my neighbour Mr Daniel D. Barnard, and returned the manuscript of his Lecture on the Morals of Politics— I had some conversation with him upon our political prospects concerning which I feel far more solicitude than hope— Barnard is one of the ablest men of the whig party. His principles generally are of the best; dashed with errors the more dangerous because honestly entertained, and rooted in a profound and vigorous mind. I paid morning visits to Mr Henry Clay lodging at Mrs Arguelles’s and to Mr Solomon Lincoln, at Brown’s hotel.— While I was at Mr Clays, numerous other visitors came in, among whom the Russian Minister Bodisco, whom Mr Clay bantered coarsely about his marriage last Spring, with a young girl at Georgetown, daughter of a clerk in one of the public offices named Williams. Bodisco took Clay’s greasy jokes very good humouredly, and with no small self complacency assured him that all was right— Clay said he had visited Mr Van Buren’s yesterday and had an hour’s conversation with him on the issue of the Presidential Election— Mr Clay further told us that before leaving home he had seen the President elect Harrison, and that he looked well, though somewhat shattered— At Mr Lincoln’s room I met Mr Webster, Governor Lincoln, and Robert C. Winthrop. I called at the Office of the Attorney General Gilpin who informed me that he had seen the President of the United States, concerning the case of the Amistad negroes, and he had concluded that the case could not be dismissed from the Supreme Court without an argument because the Spanish Minister insisted on the delivery up of the men as slaves to be sent to the Havana, as Slaves—and further that the motion to dismiss the case was made in the Circuit Court, and there refused— I said that the refusal of the Circuit Court to dismiss the cause seemed no reason for precluding the dismission of it from the Supreme Court, and that the Spanish Minister had not only not demanded the delivery of the men as Slaves, but had explicitly so demanded them as Assassins— He said there was a subsequent Letter from the Spanish Minister in April last insisting upon the delivery of the men as Slaves, upon the principles of certain Resolutions of the Senate, adopted at their last Session— I denied the right of the Spanish Minister to claim them as property—the pretended owners having claimed them—and not having appealed from the decision— Mr Giplin had also the papers from the Secretary of the Treasury respecting the purchase of the Schooner Amistad before him but did not appear to understand the question. Mr Solomon Lincoln, Mr Barnard and Mr Winthrop dined with us— My wife keeps her chamber. Mr Hallowell, and Mr Stabler were visitors from Alexandria, to solicit a Lecture. "

Mr Force and Mr Laurence came, as a Committee from the National Institution for the promotion of Science; and stated that they proposed to hold a Meeting of the Society on the first Monday, the 4th. of January next, when a discourse is to be delivered by Mr Poinsett— The Society are desirous of obtaining the use of the Hall of the House of Representatives that evening for that purpose—and wished me to offer the Resolution that it be granted; which I promised to do.— They said the Institution was likely to flourish, and that great interest was taken in it, by the people here— Mr Force left with me a memorandum of two books which I borrowed of him more than three years since, and which I have not yet returned.— The day was fully occupied and quickly passed away— I made out my list of the persons to whom the documents of which extra-copies are printed by order of the house, are to be sent— My rule of distribution is 1. One copy to each of the Editors of the Newspapers published at Plymouth (the Old Colony Memorial[)] Hingham Patriot and Quincy Patriot— The Boston Courier and Evening Gazette. 2 To my Son, and a few other personal friends. 3. To the Senators in the Legislature of Massachusetts from the Counties of Plymouth and Norfolk 4. To one representative from each of the 24 towns in the 12th. Congressional District of Massachusetts— My portion of the extra documents, is seldom sufficient for the whole of this supply— Often for not half of them— My Son—the Newspaper Editors, and the County Senators are first served— The others are furnished according to the numbers of my allowance— I keep lists of the extra documents printed by order of the house at each Session, and of the names of the persons to whom I send them— I made out my lists for the present Session; and despatched by the mail 17 copies of the Presidents annual Message.— But the lists are imperfect till the meeting of the Massachusetts Legislatures shall ascertain the Senators for the Counties of Plymouth and Norfolk, and the Representatives from the 24 towns of the 12th. Congressional district— I thought it necessary to look into the case of the Amistad captives, to prepare for the argument before the Supreme Court in January; of which I dare scarcely to think— I read especially the Article in the American and foreign Anti-Slavery Reporter of 1. October 1840. entitled the Amistad case—p. 48–51. with deep anguish of heart, and a painful search of means to defeat and expose the abominable conspiracy executive and judicial of this Government against the lives of these wretched men— How shall the facts be brought out? How shall it be possible to comment upon them with becoming temper—with calmness—with moderation—with firmness—with address—to avoid being silenced, and to escape the imminent danger of giving the adversary the advantage in the argument, by over heated zeal. Of all the dangers before me, that of losing my self possession is the most formidable— I am yet unable to prepare the outline of the argument, which I must be ready to offer the second week in January. Let me not forget my duty. "

Sunday  A bright sky overhead; a mild but snow-chilled atmosphere to breathe, and a slushy carpet in the streets under foot was the circumstantial condition of this day; and emblematical of the social and political condition of the country.— I attended this morning at the Presbyterian Church, and heard Mr Wood preach, from Hebrews 9.16. [“]For where a Testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator 17. For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.” The argument of Mr Wood was, that the Gospel was the last Will and testament of Jesus Christ; but he did not carry out the idea suggested by his text, that the validity of this testament depends entirely upon the death of the testator— This may be essential to the orthodox doctrine of the atonement; but he did not dwell upon it. He gave a summary account of the life of Jesus Christ: in a somewhat singular manner and said he was until the age of thirty, professionally a mechanic— Of this I know not what evidence there is— Certainly none in the Gospels— Nor is the gospel any where denominated a Testament— He is said by Saint Paul to be the mediator of the New Covenant, and that is the Greek title of what we call the new Testament— The congregation was very small— After dinner I attended at St. John’s Church, where Mr Hawley read the Evening Service for the 3d. Sunday in Advent, reading only the second lesson, and preached from Ecclesiastes 9.1. [“]For all this I considered in my heart, even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise and their works, are in the hand of God”—there is a remnant of the verse that he did not read. I slumped through the Snow to get to the Church; and the frequency of the worshippers was on a par with the edification of the discourse— At home my attention was diverted from the Amistad Africans to Barrow’s travels in China, which absorbed me for the remainder of the day— Barrow was the private Secretary of Lord Macartney, and his book is a valuable supplement to that of Sir George Staunton; and they form altogether a marvelous account of that said Empire of China— A patriarchal despotism realized over 300 millions of population, and continuing from time immemorial.— A nation floating upon their rivers, and never navigating the Ocean— Polygamy, Bestiality, Infanticide, Idolatry, and brutal filthiness, commingled, with extreme politeness, and high accomplishments in many of the useful and elegant arts.— The extremes of civilization and of the savage state blended together in one condition of human existence are portrayed with vivid colouring in these narratives. Barrow was left at the Palace of Yuen Min Yuen while Lord Macartney went to Zhe hol, and his description of the Consternation of the Chinese household on learning the refusal of the Embassador to perform the Ko-tou sheds some additional light upon the account of Sir George Staunton— "

Two Stone-cutters, Irishmen, named M’Closkey and Doyle came this morning to ask my assistance to obtain work for them on the new Treasury building, yet unfinished, but the last appropriation for which is exhausted— The great body of these workmen were discharged on the 1st. of September. These two and eight others were continued till the 1st. of this month, and then dismissed at a time when they could not obtain work elsewhere— They applied to the Executive Commissioners of the Public buildings, the Secretaries of the Treasury, War and the Navy.— The men offered to work without immediate pay, in reliance that Congress would make the necessary appropriation. The answer from the Secretary of the Commissioners is that they neither authorise nor prohibit the men from resuming their work, and that they must apply to the superintendant Nolan; who like corporal Trim could not save a man’s life without orders, and so the men and their families were left to starve— A sputtering Italian named Raggi came and jabbered half an hour in a jargon composed in about equal parts of French, Italian and English, with the same complaint. The Irishmen told me they had been to Governor Lincoln, but he told them that he would no longer serve on the Committee on the public buildings— At the house R. C. Winthrop, moved an amendment of the Journal of last Thursday to insert his ay on Stanly’s motion to reconsider the vote for printing 15000 copies of the Presidents Message with the Documents.— Joseph L. Williams made the same motion for himself— Petrikin objected—debate—yeas and nays 200 to 3.— The two additional votes, carried the motion to reconsider— More debate—final vote to print 10,000 copies with the documents.— Committees announced. As nearly as possible the same as at the last Session— Committee of Manufactures all the same. Petrikin Chairman of the Committee on the public buildings. Thompson of Kentucky announced the death of his predecessor Simon Anderson with a suitable panegyric, and Resolutions of condolence, and to wear crape— And Leet of Pennsylvania performed the same service for William S. Ramsey, a Patriot and sage, who at the last Session boasted that he had been one of the Harrisburg mob in 1838, and would be one again if need there should be. Instead of which he shot himself about two months ago, at a Tavern in Baltimore— He had just been re-elected to Congress; and as Leet was not ashamed to say, lived and died an honourable man— The Resolution to wear crape for him passed of course, and the house adjourned— I gave another sitting for my portrait to Mrs Towle, and when it was finished told her my objection to it was that it was too much like the original— I met there a young man named Bartlett, a graduate of Dartmouth College, and a pretty girl from Vermont—Miss Makepeace— Towle and his wife are New-Jerusalem Swedenborgians. It was near 5. p.m. when I got home to dinner— Missed the scientific evening meeting. "

Calls at the Patriotic and Washington Banks, atshop, for a Cask of Sicily Madeira wine, and at Lewis Johnson’s shop, to deliver him a Letter, delayed me, and I found the house in Session, in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the bill making a partial appropriation for the support of Government for 1840. That is, the bill to provide for the expenses of the two houses of Congress, and for the pay of their members— In ten minutes after I entered the house the Bill was reported by the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and passed— Nothing can equal the despatch with which these bills are driven through both houses— A message came from the Senate that they had elected Mr Cookman for their Chaplain— Mr Hand introduced a new naturalization bill and to repeal all the existing Laws on that subject— He moved its reference to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.moved to refer it to the judiciary Committee. Question by yeas and nays on the Union lost 96 to 99. the second vote on which a sufficient number of the Kinderhoek time-servers have given way, to turn the majority— The Bill goes to the judiciary Committee.— Virgil D. Parris moved to proceed to the election of a chaplain and nominated Thomas C. Braxton, whose chief if not only recommendation is that he is a grandson of Carter Braxton, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence from Virginia— He was elected at the second vote. I voted twice for Doctor Bates, the Chaplain of the last Session. Mr Russell the chairman of the Committee of Claims moved a Resolution that they might be allowed a clerk, at a Salary of 4 dollars a day; to which William Cost Johnson, chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, moved an Amendment for a similar allowance to them—whenever they should need it— The amendment was rejected, but the Clerk for the Committee of Claims was after some debate carried by yeas and nays— Sundry communications were received from the executive departments— I offered a Resolution, calling upon the President for a communication of documents shewing the origin of any political relations existing between the Government of the United States and that of China— When a Consul of the United States at Canton, and whether he or any one since appointed has ever been received or recognized there in that capacity— The instant after my Resolution was read Cave Johnson started up and moved to adjourn—which was carried— The Speaker came to my Seat and told me that he should call the States to-morrow for Petitions.— As I was returning home I met Charles Abbot, who repeated the invitation to me to deliver a Lecture here in the course of the Winter, which I promised in March after the close of the Session of Congress— Evening visit from Lieutenant Armistead; residing now near Norfolk in Virginia on a long furlough, for ill health.

Loud of Plymouth, and a bill upon the Clerk of the House, for the Old Colony Memorial payable to Mr Lincoln— He rode with me to the Capitol; where at half past ten, in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, met the select Committee on the falsification of house document N. 185 of the last Session—Adams, M’Kay, Bernard, Medill Dennis, all present— Hugh A. Garland, the Clerk of the house, attended with the Manuscript Message and Document, received from the President, and a copy of the printed document was furnished to the Committee from the Clerk’s Office— I proposed that minutes should be kept of the proceedings of the Committee and Mr Medill took them down— The manuscript and printed Document were identified, and certified by the Clerk to whom I administered the Oath upon the Bible to make true answers to the questions which should be put to him concerning the case under the consideration of the Committee— The examination of the clerk, and minuting his answers, brought the time to the meeting of the house, and the Committee adjourned to Friday Morning 10. O’Clock. The Clerk was directed to notify Mr Rives, one of the Printers of the house, to attend the Committee Friday Morning, and to apprize him of the subject of the examination— I proposed to send for Mr Greenhow, but that was not decided— In the House, the States were called for Petitions, and went rapidly through— I presented 8. only one of which was excluded from being received by the rule—two for rescinding the rule were laid on the table at the motion of Linn Banks and the others were referred to the Committees— After the petition of O. Bacheler had been at my motion referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs I received a note from him, and he came to me, and enquired if I could not get it referred to a select Committee— I told him that if I had made the motion the only effect would have been a motion to lay it on the table which would certainly have been carried— Leonard Hammond, who has claims upon the Government for Light house building in Louisiana, called me out and exhibited his papers to me, and I promised to go with him to the Secretary of the Treasury at 10 to morrow Morning. Thompson of Mississippi offered a Resolution instructing the Committee to report forthwith a Bill to prohibit the taking of the testimony of coloured persons in the army and navy—but he was instantly hushed and withdrew his motion. J. W Davis moved a reconsideration of the vote of yesterday referring Hands naturalization Bill to the judiciary Committee. My call upon the President for documents relating to China, was adopted with an amendment proposed by Cushing and accepted by me; without opposition, Cave Johnson happening to be absent— J.

Thursday  I had promised Mr Leonard Hammond, if he would call on me this morning at ten, to go with him to the Secretary of the Treasury, and he had promised to come, but did not— This person belongs to Rochester in my Congressional District and was recommended to me, by a Letter from the Revd. Dr Robbins of Mattapoisett, during the last Session of Congress— He was a contractor for building Lighthouses in Louisiana, and has some discussions, about his claims for payment, with the 5th. auditor of the Treasury, Pleasonton who has the charge of the Lighthouse establishment. I took to Mr A. K. Parris’s house the Bill for four years subscription to the Old Colony Memorial, for the 2d. Comptroller’s Office, which I had received last evening but one, and which was intended for Mr Solomon Lincoln— Mr. Parris was gone to his Office; but I called again in the Evening, and he promised to have the bill paid to-morrow— I walked to and from the house— J. W. Davis’s motion to reconsider the reference of Hand’s Bill to the judiciary Committee was postponed till to-morrow, the bill itself not being printed. The States were called again for Petitions and then for Resolutions.— Hunt offered a Resolution for an amendment to the Constitution to restrict the Office of President of the United States to one term of four years— Referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— Randolph moved a resolution directing the clerk to pay the extruded New-Jersey Members the usual mileage and per diem from the commencement of the last Session to the 15th. of July.— Skirmish debate— Yeas and Nays. 118 for the Resolution to 67. Wise asks to be excused from voting—too late, and refuses to vote— Mr Poinsett came to the house, and requested to draw up a memorial for the National Institution for the promotion of Science to Congress, praying for an act of incorporation; which I agreed to do—but when I moved that the use of the Hall of the house be granted to the Institution for the delivery of a discourse before them by Mr Poinsett, Pickens started a formal objection against it and a snarling debate followed. The abolition bugbear took extensively with the Southern whigs; and the expense of lighting the chandelier with no small number of the yankees. The vote was taken by yeas and nays, and carried only by 88 to 84. It is to be on the evening of the 4th. of January— Mark A. Cooper asked leave to introduce a bill to repeal the law, allowing a Salary to the Chaplains of Congress. Reed called for the yeas and nays which were 21 to 140— But Mark was not easily disconcerted— He wanted to move for a Select Committee to consider the expediency of dispensing with Chaplains, but it was not allowed. Mark is a silly, self conceited fellow— Adjourned before 3— Returning from the Capitol, I stop’d at Brown’s hotel, and saw Mr Solomon Lincoln, who told me that he had concluded to go to Baltimore in the Cars at Noon to-morrow.— Mr Clay and Mr Webster have both opened the Campaign in the Senate.

Seaver a Clerk in the second Comptroller’s Office brought me this morning a check on the Bank of the Metropolis for 8 dollars, for which I receipted the Bill for four years subscription from 1836 to 1840—to the Old Colony Memorial— I drew a check for the same sum, and took it to Brown’s Hotel to give Mr Lincoln, with the Newspaper addressed to him which I had received from Jacob H. Loud, but which from inadvertence to the manuscript direction upon it had been thrown upon the heap of my castaway newspapers—of which I receive about a dozen every day.— Mr Lincoln was not at his lodgings, and at Noon he left the City in the Cars for Baltimore—leaving word with the Barkeeper at Brown’s that he would write to me— On reaching the Capitol at 10. I found that the magnificent Chandelier suspended in the hall of the house since the close of the last Session of Congress, and said to have cost six thousand dollars, had just broken down with a tremendous crash, and crushed several desks of the members in its fall. I attended the select committee on the falsification of House document N. 185— All the members present. John C. Rives, one of the Printers of the House andTrendholm the proof reader of the Globe Office were examined and sworn.— Rives swore that he knew nothing of the alteration till after my resolution was offered in the house— Trendholm testified that the alteration was made by his direction to the compositor, and his reasons for it were that he did not know the meaning of the word, Ladino and Ladina as applied to negro Slaves he supposed the meaning of it must be sound— He said it was usual in printing for the proofreader to correct manifest errors in the copy and he produced several other instances in which it had been done—one particularly in which some German manuscript writing had been ludicrously disfigured— This man said he was a native of France, educated in England; had been 16 years engaged in printing offices; eight of the years in this City— At Noon the Committee took a recess of half an hour, anticipating the adjournment of the house, within that time— In the house Mr Cookman opened the meeting with prayer. John W. Jones, presented from the Committee of Ways and Means, a pension appropriation Bill. I enquired if the appropriation for the navy pension fund recommended by a special message from the President was included in it— That Message was referred to the Committee of Naval Affairs.— Reed, a member of the Committee said, the Chairman, (Francis Thomas) was absent, and there had been no meeting of the Committee— I said I hoped the Committee would not wait for their Chairman— Evans got in a petition from Maine about the Colonial trade— And at W. Cost Johnson’s motion, the house at half past 12. adjourned over to Monday. The Committee on the document resumed, sat till near 3. and adjourned to Monday 10. A.M— Mr Hughes of a commercial house in New-York came to enquire if duties on Silks would be laid this Session— I knew not— "

Saturday  Our horses were sent this morning to the blacksmith’s to be sharp shod; one of them kicked a boy at the shop, and came near killing him— Dr Thomas was sent for and applied leaches to bleed him— In the evening the boy was better. I returned the visits of Baron Mareschal, and Chevalier Hulsemann Austrian Minister and Chargé d’Affaires or Secretary of Legation—neither of whom was at home. I called next on Mr Thomas B. Johnson, suffering under paralytic and hypocondriac disease, varying in symptoms from day to day— Mrs Smith is at his house, confined to her chamber with a severe cold and cough— Mr Johnson now lives in Mrs John Adams’s house on the President’s Square where we lived from December 1829 to December 1838 in winter— On leaving the house, I fell in with Ogden Hoffman, and walked with him till I went into the State Department Office.— Mr Greenhow was not there— But I examined the copy of the Spanish permits for the shipment of the Amistad blacks at the Havana, transmitted by the District Attorney Holabird from the Court record at New Haven, and from which the copy transmitted with the President’s Message to the House of Representatives was made— The copy sent to the house was exactly conformable to the copy at the Department— I desired that Mr Greenhow might be notified to attend the Committee next Monday morning at 10. and to bring this copy from the court record with him— There were a mass of papers in preparation to answer the call for papers relating to our political relations with China; and the record of the Commission of Samuel Shaw as Consul at Canton, of which I requested that a copy might be sent to the house— I saw Mr Derrick who said he had not found any of the papers belonging to the Massachusetts historical Society, alledged to have been borrowed by Mr Egbert Benson; but he had found some belonging to Harvard University borrowed by Mr Albert Gallatin— I requested him to return me the Resolution of the Massachusetts historical Society, and a written answer to my enquiry. Mr Van Ness was with Mr Forsyth for about an hour, while I was waiting with the Clerks one of whom gave me a printed copy of a pamphlet called a brief review of some of the Points in the case of the L’Amistad and the principles involved— I had much conversation with Mr Forsyth, on this case and found him smarting under the scourge of judge William Jay’s comments on his conduct— But inflexibly determined to pursue the appeal to the Supreme Court.— He said he disapproved of Mr Greenhow’s troubling me about this matter— Would it were over— Mr. Pope paid us a morning visit, and in the Evening Mr Joseph S. Wilson came with a Letter as President of the Union Literary and debating Society of Washington City, requesting me to deliver a Lecture before them. "

Timothy 3.16—“And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.” A Christmas discourse; on the Godhead of Jesus Christ. And he read the first chapter of the gospel of John— The delivery of Mr Cookman is vehement and impassioned to excess— It is highly popular, and I am of those who relish that style of speaking, which many persons of cooler temper and calmer judgment disapprove. He began his sermon this day thus—“Says the objector to the Christian Religion, and to the holy scriptures, I cannot believe this system; for there is too much of the marvellous too many miracles, too many mysteries in it; I cannot reconcile it to my understanding.[”]— Then he replied, if the objection of mystery could be a sufficient ground for disbelief a man can believe nothing— The simplest operations of nature, the growth of a blade of grass from the seed, the course of the Sun round the heavens are mysteries as far beyond the comprehension of the human mind, as any of the miracles recorded in the Scriptures.— He then divided his subject into the six particular properties, which constitute in their combination, the greatness of the mystery of godliness, and commented upon each of them in turn: and in expounding each of the properties he introduced the texts of Scripture which explain or confirm them— The effort was to demonstrate the divinity of Christ—certainly countenanced by numerous texts, taken according to the Letter; but all susceptible of a spiritual sense or requiring a different translation from that of Jamess Doctors.— There was nothing new in the argument or in the authorities cited by Mr Cookman—nothing that produced a new impression upon my mind— After the service I returned the visit of Mr Hunter the Speaker; an amiable good hearted, weak headed young man, prematurely hoisted into a place for which he is not fit; precisely for his Virginian quiddities.— I sat and conversed an hour with him but could make absolutely nothing of him— Another hour I passed with Mr Daniel Webster. The chief characteristic of whose conversation was reserve— It is now announced in the Newspapers that he is to be Secretary of State— This afternoon I attended at St. John’s Church half an hour belated— Mr Hawley read the Evening prayers for the fourth Sunday in Advent, and a stranger preached from John 5:40. And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. Miss Cutts was in our pew— My evening was consumed in partly reading Dr William E. Channing’s new pamphlet upon emancipation—and in poring over the classical effusions of the infancy and caducity of the Marquess of Wellesley, sent me with a kind Letter by Mr John M’Tavish. "

I hastened to the Capitol, as I found three quarters of an hour before the time, and employed them in writing a short Letter to Dr Palfrey. At 10. the Committee on the falsified Documents N. 185 met and examined upon Oath Thomas S. Geddes the compositor at the printing Office of Blair and Rives, and upon affirmation Robert Greenhow, the translator at the Department of State— Geddes swore to the best of his recollection, that he set the types according to the manuscript, and that the word sound was substituted for Ladino, and Ladina, by the direction of the proofreader, marked on the proof— Greenhow brought with him the original manuscript of his translation, and the document received at the Department of State from the District Attorney in Connecticut Holabird, containing the copy of the Record of the District Court, and in it the copy of the two permits to ship the negroes, in one of which are the words negros Ladinos, and in the other the words negras ladinas— Greenhow said there was no possible sense in which the word sound was a correct translation of the words Ladino or Ladina— The examination of witnesses was closed; but there was no definitive action of the Committee, the House being already in Session— It was 20 minutes past 12. when I went down, and French the sub-clerk was reading the vote of yeas and nays upon John W. Davis’s motion to reconsider the reference of Hand’s naturalization Bill to the Judiciary Committee— I was too late to vote. The reconsideration was refused 90 to 93. The States were then (after a desultory debate about the authority by which the Clerk of the house paid between 11 and 1200 dollars to Charles J. Ingersoll for witnesses on the trial between him and Charles Naylor of the contested election at the last Session of Congress, which was finally laid asleep by reference to thee Committee of accounts) called through for petitions— There were very few, but multitudes of the members succeeded in slipping in Resolutions and Bills, by general consent— This consumed the time so that when the nominal call for Petitions was gone through, it was near 3. O’Clock, and before the call for Resolutions could be announced a motion to adjourn was made and carried— I offered a petition from Elisha Huntington, and 186 others for an amendment of the naturalization Laws, so as to admit coloured foreigners to the right of holding real estate and voting—referred to the judiciary Committee— I notified the members of the Committee of Manufactures to attend a meeting to-morrow Morning; except Dromgoole who is sick, and Worthington who is at home Evening writing till near Midnight—on the Amistad captives— "

He came this morning with two young men whom he introduced to me, I believe by the name of Robinson, and he gave me a printed copy of Gurney’s Letters to Henry Clay of Kentucky describing a Winter in the West Indies. I had received two days ago a pamphlet upon emancipation by Dr William E. Channing, which is a running commentary upon this work of Gurney— I had a morning visit also from Stephen C. Phillips of Salem, whom I invited to dine with us on Christmas day, but he said he should obliged to leave the City to be home by next Saturday— He gave me some information concerning China, and promised more from a young man named King of the house of Oliphant at Canton—the same I suppose whom I met on the 10th. of last Month at dinner on the 10th. of last Month at Mr Abbott Lawrence’s in Boston, at dinner— Meeting of the Committee of manufactures at 11. this morning— Present Adams, Slade, Tillinghast, Mitchell, John Davis of Pennsylvania, and Eastman— Absent Nisbet whom I had notified yesterday—Dromgoole who is sick, and Worthington; who goes home weekly on Saturdays, and has not yet returned.— I read several petitions referred by the house to the Committee, and two Letters to members of the house, which they had put into my hands.— There was a desultory conversation, whether the Committee should call up and report again the bill for suppressing frauds in the collection of the revenue, which was lost at the last Session with the votes of two thirds of both houses in its favour— The Committee came to no conclusion, but adjourned to next Tuesday Morning at 11— In the House there was an answer of Garland the Clerk to the enquiry about the payment of money to C. J. Ingersoll for witnesses— Answer referred to the Committee on Accounts— Rives called up the Report of the Committee of Elections made at the last Session upon the election of Charles Naylor, and moved for its consideration to-morrow. After debate he varied his motion, so as to take it up on the first Tuesday in January which was carried— The States were called for petitions, but very few were presented— Few Reports of Committees. F. Thomas reported a bill concerning the Navy Pension fund. I asked if it was an appropriation; he said it was, and that he should call it up at an early day. Sundry Resolutions were discussed, till one offered by Mr Barnard who moved an adjournment— Carried. Evening visits from Mr Reed and Mr Taliaferro— And Bernard M’Closkey came to request me to speak to the Committee on the Public buildings, for the Stone-cutters— "

I went this morning to the house, expecting to take little or no part in the business of the day— But the States were called over for Petitions; of which there were not a dozen presented— One of them was by Francis James the Pennsylvania Quaker— William Cost Johnson objected to its reception under the gag rule— It was sent to the Speaker who looked into it and declared it within the rule— James insisted that it was not and the reading of it was called for and refused— Someone moved to lay the motion of reception on the table, which was carried by yeas and nays 99 to 53 When the State of Massachusetts was called, I said I had no petition to present, but asked leave to offer my Resolution of Call upon the Postmaster General, for a list of Post masters removed since the 3d. of March 1829— The Resolution was received, but at M’Kay’s motion was ordered to lie over one day under the rule— The Committees were called for reports— John W. Jones from the Ways and Means reported the Navy and Indian annuity Appropriation Bills.— When the Committee of Manufactures was called, I said I had no report to make, but a motion that the bill N. 100 of the house of the last Session, as it was when the Session closed should be referred to the Committee— And now came an explosion totally unexpected by me— Pickens came out with a gunpowder blast against the bill— The Speaker said my motion was not in order— Stanly moved to suspend the rule, to enable me to make the motion, which brought down Wise with a broadside upon him, which he returned double shotted— The rules were suspended by a vote of 131 to 45.— Wise then moved that the reference should be to the Committee of Ways and Means, and made another Speech— Pickens called for the reading of the title of the Bill which was done— Wise called for the reading of the whole bill, which was begun; and he then modified his motion to the reading all after the 16th. Section, which was done— He insisted that the subject belonged to the Committee of Ways and Means; and Tillinghast replied to him— Horace Everett all the time in a low almost inaudible voice repeating question—question— Morgan moved the previous question, which wise moved to lay on the table, but withdrew his motion. It was carried, and the vote to refer to the Committee of Manufactures was carried 109 to 50— Adjourned just before 3. But the New-Hampshire, Maine and New-York serviles flinched at the last, and voted against the reference— Wise moved instructions to the Committee to strike out, after the 16th. Section, all the remainder of the Bill; but withdrew the motion. Dr John M. Thomas was here this Evening; and also Mr William Jagger, the volunteer politician and pamphleteer from Suffolk County, Long-Island who kept me in conversation upwards of two hours— The consequence of which was that I lost the whole Evening for writing.

Garland, of the house and Brooke M Berry, one of the copying clerks, were sworn and examined concerning a small slip of paper, attached to the 87th. page of the written document, and containing merely the names given in Spanish upon that page of the manuscript, anglicised— They testified that it was a loose paper received with the manuscript document as returned from the printers— French attached it by a wafer to the manuscript page— Trendholm the proof reader of the printing Office had acknowledged that the loose paper was in his hand-writing, but did not recollect why he had written it— Mr. Barnard came in after the examination of French and Berry was over.— There was conversation as to the principles on which the Report should be drawn up— M’Kay and Medill appeared averse to any expression of censure upon the practice either of the Printing Office or of the Department of State— M’Kay requested me to state the principles on which I thought the report should be prepared— I said I would state the fact of falsification, and that it was done by the proof reader of the printing Office—to express disapprobation of the altering of documents at the printers, without authority and especially on matters so material—to state also the interpolation of the word negros in the copies and translations of the permit to Ruiz, and the omission of the name of Francisco, from the copy of the translated permit in the manuscript from the Department of State— All this M’Kay and Medill thought was not within the Commission— And I asked how the printing-office, and the Department would stand with a report of the falsification, and the name of the falsifier. Trendholm the proof reader— Medill thought the reference to the testimony would be sufficient— M’Kay was more wary— After much discussion, he proposed that I should draw up a report according to my own views and lay it before the Committee; to which I agreed— In the house the day was consumed upon a Memorial from the Legislature of the State of Illinois and a motion of Reynolds to refer it to the Committee of Public Lands with Instructions to report a Bill to graduate the price of the public lands down to nothing— This started the Land robbery passion, and Reynolds, Pickens, W. Cost Johnson, and Hubbard of Alabama, kept it up, till near 3. when immediately after a refusal to adjourn by yeas and naysthe house did adjourn over to Monday without them— Frank Thomas chairman of the Committee of Naval Affairs came to me in his own way to tell me that he was going to call up immediately his bill concerning the navy pension fund; which he said could not take five minutes to pass, and asked whether I had any particular enquiry to make about it— I found he knew nothing about his own bill and set him upon his enquiries— Mr John Connell spent the Evening here.

Having heard last Sunday morning at the Capitol a very orthodox Christmas Sermon, and having this day great need of my time, I dispensed with attendance at Church, and returned visits to Govr. Lincoln, and his fellow lodgers at Miss Corcoran’s and found them in potations of egg-nog.— and to Mr and Mrs Henderson of Mississippi; Mr. and Mrs Winthrop, and Mr and Miss Saltonstall, at Mrs Mount’s—Pennsylvania avenue— While I was there General Scott came in with James Monroe as visitors. I met in the Street Mr Dawson of Georgia, whom I was intending to visit, and who had just called at my house while I was out.— Shortly before dinner, I had visits from Mr John Davis, our Senator, and Governor elect of Massachusetts, with Thomas W. Williams a member of the house from Connecticut— We have heretofore been accustomed to entertain a family party at dinner on Christmas days; but the condition of the family on the last and two or three preceding years has deprived us of this pleasure, and of the exercise of almost all acts of hospitality— At this time, my wife has been these ten days keeping her chamber— Mr T. B. Johnson and Mrs Smith are confined to theirs— The situation of Mr Frye’s family is irksome—we could not all meet; but I invited a few members of the house, and Mr Connell, the nine names first on the margin and they dined with me. Charles Ogle had promised to come, but did not. We had only men at table—the Ladies preferring to dine together. The day went off pleasantly, but I had no time, either to prepare for the argument before the Supreme Court, so soon to overtake me—or to draw up the Report on the falsification of the document N. 185, or to examine the condition of the Navy pension fund, for the debate, which I intend if possible to raise upon that appropriation Bill— I did however find a few of the most important documents of the last Session relating to the Navy pension fund and to the system of investing public monies and trust funds in stocks of the States, which I consider equivalent to assuming so much of State debts. In the search for the first authority to make investments in stocks of the States, I must have recourse to the Journals and Documents of both houses, the Register of debates, and the Laws for several past Sessions. In the course of this pursuit, I trace the investments in Stocks of the States to Silas Wright in May 1836. and that carries me back to the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury in December 1835.

Dawson, who was not at his lodgings; but I met in the entry Mr Habersham, who lodges at the same house, and sat half an hour with him. While I was there Mrs and Miss Croghan came into visit Mrs Dawson, and she was called down— She thanked me for the present which I sent her of my mother’s Letters.— Mr George Bancroft Collector of the port of Boston is here, and left his card a few days since at my house. I enquired of Mr Davis who married his Sister where he lodged, and he said at Fuller’s; and that Mrs Bancroft was with him. I called there; but he was out, and I left a Card— This man is such a rabid democrat, and such a sycophantic double dealer, that I am tempted to spurn him as a swindler— But perhaps cold civility is the wisest course to pursue with them— Mr Hammond came after dinner with a complaint that Stephen Pleasanton the fith auditor, and superintendent of light-houses, had finally refused to pay him according to his contract, and the award of competent arbitrators, appointed by Prieus the late Collector of New-Orleans and himself by Pleasonton’s own direction for building two Light houses in Louisiana. Pleasonton now refuses to pay him any part of his claim, unless he will make a deduction of 4000 dollars from 14000. the amount of his demand sustained by his vouchers, and give a receipt in full.— Mr Hammond wanted my advice what to do: and said he had also consulted with Mr John Reed, and wished to advise with him again.— I advised him to ask Mr Reed if an Application to the Circuit Court of the District for a Mandamus, would not be his best remedy. I believed it would, and if Mr Reed should concur in that opinion he must apply to some lawyer, say W. S. Cox, to take out a Mandamus.— After him came Mr John Connell with a memorial to Congress from Stephen Blight for the heirs of Robert Fulton, which he requested me to present on Monday to the house. It is an old claim; a Bill for the allowance and payment of which passed the houseyears ago, but was arrested in the Senate, and left the claim pending. Blight married a daughter of Fulton— He was rich but has failed; and Fulton’s family are destitute— Mr Connell is one of the Directors of the Pennsylvania Bank of the United States going out of Office; and from his reluctant and hesitating answers to my questions, disclosed the dismal condition of that institution, and a very suspicious aspect of debts due to it both by its former President N. Biddle, and its late Cashier Cowperthwait— Connell says he believes the Capital of the Bank is yet equal to 25 Millions. It should be 35. But the whole of its debt to the United States is paid. "

Sunday  Attended morning worship at the Capitol, where Mr Braxton the Chaplain from the House of Representatives preached, but delivered his text in so low a tone of voice that I did not hear it; nor could I infer what it was from the Sermon. The preacher, when elected, was announced to be, of the Baptist denomination, and he appeared this day to be of the orthodox creed—for he said that the necessity of being born again, though an old-fashioned doctrine was nevertheless true. His manner of delivery is graceful, and his personal appearance neat and gentlemanly. His style of writing and speaking is temperate and decent but hardly grave enough— His devotion not cold—nor very warm—his arguments and quotations from Scripture traditionary.— There were several members of the Baptist congregation of this City, seated in front of the Speaker’s chair who sung two hymns given out by him, and also Watts’s 100th. Psalm by a signal from him— After the morning service, I visited Mr Granger, at Gadsby’s, and saw him and his daughter. He had been to keep Christmas at Baltimore—dined at Mr Meredith’s with a large party—then at tea with a family party of forty at Mr Gilmor’s and afterwards at a family party of forty two at Mr Gilmor’s sisters Mrs Donnell’s— I visited also at Hyatt’s, and found Mr Taliaferro and Mr T. W. Williams with seven other gentlemen there; and constituting their mess— Miss Cutts dined with us, and after dinner At St. John’s Church, Mr Hawley read the Evening prayer for the Sunday after Christmas, and preached from John 14.2. “In my father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.”— A searching North-west prevailed, growing colder through the day. Mr Hammond was here this Evening; and said Mr John Reed had requested him to tell me, that he would come to-morrow morning at 10. O’Clock, and go with me to Mr Pleasonton, the fifth Auditor to remonstrate with him against the conditions which he insists upon exacting from Mr Hammond for the settlement of his account—requiring a deduction of more than four thousand dollars, from a sum of about 14000. awarded to Mr Hammond by two arbitrators chosen according to Pleasonton’s own direction, one by the Collector at New-Orleans, and the other by Mr Hammond, and yet compelling Mr Hammond to give a receipt in full of all demands— I promised to go with Mr Reed, who, he says thinks that a Mandamus in this case would not lie— I must distrust my opinions upon points of law— In attempting to resume this evening the preparation for the case of the Amistad captives, I meet immediately the questions what right Lieutenant Gedney had to seize them on the shore of New-York, or the vessel on the high Seas— I can find no such right; and yet I foresee too clearly that I shall either not be allowed to make the question or that it will be suppressed without even being answered— Oh! how shall I do justice to this case, and to these men?

Mr Reed called at 10 O’Clock this morning, and I went with him first to the Office of Stephen Pleasonton fifth Auditor of the Treasury to remonstrate against his arbitrary attempt to cut down by a deduction of more than 4000 dollars the account of Mr Hammond—without allowing him even the right of petitioning Congress for allowance of the deduction— Pleasonton refusing to abide by the award of arbitrators, appointed by his own direction, had referred the Bill to some dependent of his own office who reduced it ad libitum and then reported to the Secretary of the Treasury the reduced bill, to be paid upon Hammond’s signing a receipt in full of all demands. Mr Woodbury directs another petty retrenchment, and orders the bill to be paid accordingly. I insisted that the whole bill ought to be paid according to the award of the referees, but Mr Reed only demanded what Hammond himself had brought his mind to consent to; that is that he should take the amount of the reduced Bill, reserving the right to petition Congress for the remainder— Pleasonton shuffled about this, till at last said he was willing, but the Secretary of the Treasury had directed otherwise— We then went to the Secretary himself, who told us that he had not examination of the case at-all; and that he had directed one small charge which he thought inadmissible to be struck out in all other respects had merely confirmed Pleasonton’s report and particuly in requiring a receipt in full of all demands from Hammond. That he had no objection to Hammond’s reserving the right to petition Congress, and would so direct if Pleasonton would write him a line advising it— We next returned to Pleasonton who shuffled again insisting that he had not recommended the exaction of the receipt in full, till at last he went and fetched the copy of his letter to the Secretary, and there it was in so many words— I almost lost my temper, and as Mr Hammond last evening had requested me to do spoke to him very plain— Reed teazed him to write the Letter to the Secretary which he had promised, and to which Woodbury had promised to conform, leaving to Hammond the right to Petition Congress, but he preferred making another trial to compromise and settle with Hammond himself—to which we agreed; but I told him if he did not agree with Hammond, it should go before Congress, for I would introduce it there— At the house, Thomas, Chairman of the Committee of Naval Affairs, called up the Bill appropriating upwards of 151000 dollars to pay the Navy pensions to be due on the first of next Month— The house went into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union— M’Kay in the Chair— The Speaker first called me to the Chair; but I asked him to excuse me; as I intended to address the Committee on the Bill. I did so, and opened a debate not soon to close— The Bill was reported to the House— Charles Shepard moved a second section, repealing the Navy Pension Act of 3. March 1837. which was carried by yeas and nays 81 to 70. and the bill passed.— Mr Wilcocks was here this Evening— "

Tuesday—  Mr Devlin a Clerk in Mr Pleasonton’s Office came this morning with a number of papers to explain to me his reasons for insisting on many deductions from Mr Hammond’s account, and to shew me the various estimates of different persons to whom he had referred them; all which he had already done yesterday— I told him that I had heard all this yesterday, and could not possibly judge of the correctness of estimates so widely differing from each other for the same thing— But that I had understood that Mr Pleasonton and Mr Hammond were to have agreed together and settled the account between them— He said that was what they proposed to do this day; but Mr Pleasonton was apprehensive that I might mention the subject in the house— I assured him I should not do this unless it should turn out that Mr Pleasonton and Mr Hammond finally disagreed about the settlement— At half past ten I attended the Meeting of the Committee of Manufactures— Present Adams, Nisbet, Tillinghast, Slade, Mitchell and Davis; absent Dromgoole, Worthington and Eastman— I brought the Bill for suppressing frauds on the revenue immediately before the Committee; and the report in the New-York Herald of the Meeting of the New-York Merchants, and the Speech of the Scotchman Robert Jaffray against the Bill— I read also Bennett’s remarks in the Herald upon the debate in the house of last Wednesday, and on the Letter then read in the house from Robert Jaffray to James Monroe— Bennett fiercely on the accuracy of the report, and defies Jaffray to his teeth.— Nisbet said that Bennett’s New-York Herald was utterly unworthy of credit, and he would not believe any charge contained in it against any man— Other members of the Committee were not so incredulous— They thought Mr Jaffray’s Letter a very equivocal denial— After some discussion upon the Bill Mr Slade moved that the Chairman be directed to report the House Bill of the last Session N. 100. as amended by the Senate without the Sections added by the Senate— This after some opposition from Nisbet was agreed to by the Committee and the question was postponed to the next Tuesday at half past ten, whether the Senate Bill should also be reported— When I entered the house I found them debating a motion by Giddings of Ohio, to reconsider the Section of the Navy pension appropriation Bill, repealing the Act of 3. March 1837—moved yesterday by Charles Shepard and carried— And the Bill actually so passed— This debate continued about an hour, and I took part in it— Shepard rose and began to reply when a message from the Senate announced the death of Felix Grundy, a member of that body from Tennessee—whereupon A. V. Brown pronounced the regular Eulogy upon him, and moved the crape-veiled Resolutions, and the immediate adjournment of the house—adopted of course— I went to the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures—drew up a short report on the falsified document, and assorted the papers for publication— At 4. p.m. I went to Mrs Hewitt’s and dined with Messrs. Daniel Webster and Edward Curtis. Mrs Webster, her niece Miss Le Roy, and Mrs Curtis—Governors Davis and Lincoln Saltonstall and Cushing were there— Home at 8. P.M. "

Wednesday  Two Ladies whose names have escaped me, called this morning with a subscription paper, for a one dollar annual contribution for the poor of the foundery methodist church— They took the dollar as a donation.— A Mr Rudolph, came and informed me that he was from Boston— That he was poor, and had come and brought his family with him to get a place— He believed the Commissioner of public buildings had one to bestow, and he would thank me for a Letter of recommendation to that Officer— I told him I was not in that habit of recommending any person for Officer; and especially that I could not recommend any person with whom I had no acquaintance— I went to the Capitol an hour before the meeting of the house, and spent it in preparing the Bill for the more effectual collection of the revenue to be reported to the house; and I gave it with the draught of a report on the falsified document, to Mr Berry of the Clerk’s Office to be copied— At the meeting of the house, I asked leave to present the four Resolutions in relation to investments of public monies in the stocks of the States and the sales of such Stocks which I had prepared at the last Session of Congress, but which the house then refused to receive— No objection was now made to receiving them, and the Speaker was about taking the question upon their adoption when Cave Johnson objected and they were laid-over; with an order that they be printed— Samson Mason asked leave to introduce a Resolution of enquiry concerning the cost of certain Indian schools stipulated by Treaties—but Cave Johnson stopped that, as being out of order; insisting that Charles Shepard had the floor on the motion to reconsider the Section of the navy pension appropriation act which repeals the Act of 3. March 1837— Accordingly Shepard proceeded for about an hour, in a venomous, sophistical and unprincipled speech, in which he vented a long gathering burden of spleen against me, for which I had in readiness, a castigation which I shall not be allowed to administer; for after Shepard finished, several other members discussed and discoursed upon the act of 3. March 1837. almost without touching upon its real merits, till 3. O’Clock when Jameson of Missouri moved the previous Question; which cuts off my right of reply.— A motion was then made and carried to adjourn— Brockway has got up a subscription to print my Speech of Monday in a pamphlet— I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer and took from Mr Seaton a couple of copies of this day’s paper in which the Speech is reported by Wheeler—to revise it, which I was yet not able to do this Evening— Mr Seaton gave me a budget of Letters which he has received from Christopher Hughes at Stockholm, with injunction to communicate them to me— John Baer the buckeye blacksmith, and his brother James were here.

Mr Dennis is gone home to keep the Christmas holidays, and Mr Barnard forgot my notification, so that M’Kay and Medill were my only associates at the meeting— In the discussion at the last Meeting upon the principles on which the report should be drawn up, I had proposed to touch upon the other mutilation of the document charged by judge Jay—upon the practice of allowing proof readers to depart from their copy, in the printing of public documents, upon the omission of one of the names of the 49 negroes in the translation of the Passport for the Ladinos of Ruiz, in the document from the Department of State, whence I inferred that it had been transmitted from the Department without being collated—to all which M’Kay and Medill had objected; and said it was not within the authority of the Committee; that they were charged only to report facts; and that all these circumstances to which I alluded might be very proper for a speech, and not for a report— I told them then what the consequence of their tight lacing would be; but I prepared the report according to their measure, simply stating the fact of falsification—and by whom it was committed—referring to the testimony, without one word of comment. It did not suit them— They wanted to acquit the proof reader of all bad intention and the house printers of all responsibility—the administration of all knowledge or participation in the wrong— I said if the report must give opinions, I could not forbear to pass censure upon all those parties— It came to be 12. O’Clock— They did not know whether to agree to the report or not. They would consult together and let me know.— M’Kay took the testimony which he afterwards returned to me in the house: but postponed telling me whether they would agree to my report or not— In the house numerous Bills from the Senate were twice read and referred—and Two Messages from the President, one of them the answer to my call for documents relating to China— I reported from the Committee of Manufactures for the more effectual collection of the revenue. Pickens attempted to prevent it from getting in; but failed— Referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union.— I asked Jamieson to withdraw his motion for the previous question to enable me to reply to Charles Shepard— Jamieson refused— I appealed to the Justice of the house in vain— They sustained the previous question, and refused to reconsider.— A Letter form Rives, one from the house printers complained that the Clerk had given much of the house printing and binding to Langtree— After debate referred to a Select committee of 5.— States called through for Petitions. Debate on the burning of the Caroline. Attree’s Letter to me read— Monroe Adjourned after 3. over to Monday. Call at the Intelligencer Office. Seaton. "
