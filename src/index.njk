    <h2 class="subtitle" style="text-align: left;">Welcome to the Primary Source Coop Lab Space.</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the Primary Source Cooperative of the Massachusetts Historical Society (the Cooperative, MHS) is
        to provide a platform designed and governed by consensus to assist the digital publication of documentary
        editions led by scholars studying the American long 19th century (1789â€“1914) and who would not otherwise
        have a portal for affordable, supportive online publishing. In this form, it serves the needs of people preparing
        relevant archival materials for distribution, enriching the work of scholars and users who seek to understand
        this critical period in American history, when revolution and reform were causing fundamental changes in
        social and political culture...</p>
